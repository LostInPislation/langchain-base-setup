Wolf Aleve the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon hybrid caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome to the ruined throne room of castle Drakken when last we left our heroes they had fought a climatic battle in the throne room against the demonic appendage from worlds beyond an insane demonic creature known as a civics witch from a hard-fought battle in which saw the death of the Caspian and their leader Jupiter Jones but one Caspian still survives pollute Oh Jackson I'm girly everything's fine Sebastian fell and had his mind broken in the midst of battle and vayo almost found herself got down by the mutated Minotaur form of the once Prince Leonard who was himself slain by Elias Drexel is collecting themselves in the broken halls of Castle Drakon as they lick their wounds to the chittering sounds of teeming masses of rattling x' swarming up the stairs of Castle Drakon towards the throne room as thunderclaps in the distance and the keening roar of the dragon can be heard as you look outside the windows down into the courtyard you can see the teeming masses of rattling swarming the courtyard as the great bronze dragon flies across the hordes shocking them with its lightning breath barely making a dent in the masses of rats that fill the courtyards yeah guys by the way I heard lots of rats coming up the stairs looking out across the walls of Castle Drakken the battlements beyond the throne rooms windows give a great vantage point you can see the Minotaur's defending the walls as they are cut down by swaths of rattling x' maybe we should have left the big guy to kill more rats hindsight is 20/20 I I thought that we were I thought we were in the clear I mean I didn't really think we were in the clear I just thought we'd have we'd have more than 30 seconds to regroup what I'm so tired yes I'm so tight is it from your mind being broken and dying it's from my mind being broken yes those those things combination I've been insane for like the better part of a week I'm just so tired I died too and thank you for helping me up I think ADA anytime helping me speaks I am not long for this world I must return to the flame but I have one last reserve to gift upon you Makeda touches you each with a healing touch and your restored each 20 hit points Thank You Makeda it's okay I'm at 21 we're good it was really easy to do you guys need any more healing I mean yeah I'm still bleeding a lot and my brain is shattered I could use a lot more healing the healing wave resonates out across the others in the chamber of healing the wounds of Elias and the surviving hooded lanterns as Makeda is enveloped in a column of flame and disappears we could have used her Kali she suddenly has to go when all the rats show yeah like I guess she helped us with the epic throne battle but it's like oh there's more problems I mean she did say save your life yeah yeah I guess guys can't be choosers right I'm alive for now do you hear that more coming do you have any more in you I have more healing potions that I can drink so I have more in me we're going to have to make a decision now what are we going to do I think we need to get the badges to your heart that's my thought maybe he can stop the rats I think he can help defend the castle from this threat and I know that it's gonna be a temporary solution to keep him there but it's not it's not signing his death warrant so I think it's it'll give us more time he can defend the castle if we can get the badges to him maybe against the rats maybe pushing them back we have an army marching on dragon hime the way I see it they're gonna have to cut through all those rats to get to us they are are you okay with with this this means yawns stays down there it means he stays down there until we can find a way to put George on the throne until we can defeat the demon until we can figure this out but it'll give us more time at the very least I know Johann won't be able to command all the defenses of drakon Heim but perhaps he can prevent them from trying to kill us that might just give us what we need if the gargoyles of thick golems if all the other constructs of the city if he shuts all the doors bars all the gates but we could still pass do you think well what are we waiting for there's one other thing Eldrick yes and you get down here quickly oh yeah we're gonna pick you up we're heading downstairs what's the situation like where you are well the wall of force is holding and we are safe what floor are you on when we saw them coming in we we ran up a few levels and I've created a new wall of force to protect us we're just were two levels up there's more coming but they are moving quickly when you get to us we how do we get out of here we're gonna do our best we're gonna get to you you might have to come with us to the basement we are going to deliver all of the badges to Johan and we are gonna set the defenses of this castle up to protect that should give us time if River and I have some spells prepared we can transform into giant Eagles or fly and we can get everyone on the backs we should just make for the balconies and get out of here as quickly as possible once you've done that yeah that sounds great that makes sense okay but are we gonna be able to get to them I mean we have we have to try it's we have to go all we can do is do i before the rats overwhelm them before we go though I might have to chug a few potions check it on the way all right and you drink and walk yes I too I'm going to chug chugalug is superior for tea yep now gauging where I knew the rats were coming from were they coming up both stairwells they when you look down they were definitely swarming up the main stair okay and in what order how they're gonna proceed through the castle Eldrick tribes in there they're moving in all directions they're coming up the stairs they're going through all the doors there it sounds like they're fighting however they find hmm it means we were probably not safe do you think we can do you think we can sneak I don't know sneaking is gonna be an option and there's one last thing to keep in mind guys at some point during this I suspect the queen of Thieves just gonna make a play right on cue oh no one really a minute were you waiting for me to say I'm like just finishing up potions oh my god come on I've been up here in the balcony for the last foot a little while and time is running short she says from up on up she's on the upper balcony beside her are lies and deceit Ryan Payne and three other thugs clad in black she herself any illusions that you might have seen of her in the past any past forms are not there this is Katerina von Kessel she's wearing her she has a wide-brimmed red hat her rapier and dagger at her side and a large long red trench coat with black lining and inside she crosses her arms and leans over the balcony you can fight your way down there but we all know there's a better way to handle this I can't think of one it means your way it's not a better way I also disagree but I didn't know how to say it cool so you're going to choose a temporary solution letting your father rot in this castle for how long until we can fix it and we will you're not the only person here who has power cat you're going to let a mouse suffer and the bowels of the abyss I'm gonna get mouth you back Pluto you're going to leave your mission unfulfilled it's to be decided or I'm putting it on hold like temporary like I'll finish it I swear I'm just procrastinating a little bit look she's trying to get into our heads sounds like to me that your course of action doesn't get any of you what you want at all our course of action doesn't get you what you want and that's why you're pestering us so you'd rather no-one get what they want that we late leave this place just a cursed City because why you don't want a rightful heir sitting on the throne of this city I actually do just not you we're gonna get George onto that throne what we need is time time to study the rift and you your plan is flawed we're not putting you on that throne we're not putting you in control of Drakon Heim because we've seen what you do you're manipulative and you've been manipulating us this whole time the way I see it you've already run out of time we'll see about that you're gonna fight your way down there get back down to the bowels of this castle give that all up go the rats are tenacious I'll sneak around them and I'll pick the seals off your corpses when they're done with you so be it she can't do anything here if we have the seals right right probably I don't know how much we survived this long we'll do it the rattling 'z don't know that we're anything but what we've told them yet we might have an upper hand they're our friends maybe maybe where's the reference maybe we can talk some sense into another I [Music] think you might be a little disappointed by that they're in a frenzy look at them she gestures out to the windows and if we don't give you the throne what are you gonna do that the way I see it well I made a gamble on one bet maybe I best fold my hand and wait for the next play if you think that I'm we can play this one last bet this one last Bluff but this isn't my last chance not by a long shot if I thought it was I wouldn't be here there's something else waiting down there yeah but for the three of you it is your last chance I'm giving you one last chance otherwise you can go off to your deaths I don't believe anything that you say not anymore I don't believe anything you've ever said to me even when we were kids spend all these years blaming myself for that mistake but you even said it yourself you're the one who talked me into it you're the one who pushed me to do that that was you you've been manipulating me my whole life we're not gonna let you do it anymore I'm gonna get Maus back on my terms not on yours one way or another Sebastian someone's always gonna be manipulating you you think you're so clever and you are but you're a bit of a blunt instrument all three of you are you just play things I'm pretty sharp it's sharp sure it's a sharp sword sharpest thing about you thank you now listen look we've had our differences you don't trust me you have no reason to but I would prefer not to have to pick those seals off your corpses then help us help me help you help us help you don't even have to give me the seals all you have to do is give some of my friends here then and I'll sit on that throne and we will take this city back we will take the city back without you you've proven time and time again that you have no place here you are not a good ruler for Drakon Heim and you're not a good person in general you do not deserve the you've done nothing to show that you have any loyalty to track and hunt or to its people alright well have it your way if you change your mind I'll be waiting we have to go let's go we had other things to do I walk towards the doors yeah I'm with you I'm like I I'm I'm silent cuz I'm just like glaring at her the best angry glare I can do I walk away last I stared her for a while longer and then you make for the doors her and her her and her retinue leapt down off the balcony pulling a zip line as they go so she waves see you on the other side as she walks towards the steps of the throne I stopped where's the crown right now there was a crown in this room the crown itself is draped in the midst of the guts of the sibber axe how far away is it from us well you are leaving by the main doors so it's about 30 feet away I want to telekinesis it to my hand okay you reach out with telekinesis and grab the crown in your hand this is for Albert or George look I just I died earlier today it's been a big day I've had a big 10 minutes this is for George Oh redo redo I send it back a little bit let me put back a man man I think I kind of grumble away as I walk away because oh do we trust leaving her alone in the throne room I don't know what she you know I really would like to meet George one day my brother's dead my sister's banished he's really the only family I have left beyond what's happened to my mother she's here isn't she - yeah where's she downstairs look if you wanted to help us you could have been here fighting with us you could have helped us every step of the way you've only been in our way you really haven't done anything so pretending like you're doing this for us it's just like it's so lost on our years at this point it's just empty it's so empty we're taking this crown and we're leaving good luck thank you come on gang come on dragons let's open the store confidently yeah what's the worst that could happen no really machine you all right I push open the double doors of the throne room okay come on Elias oh yeah glares at cat princess and walks with you the hallway is filled with some scaring small rats and as you step out into the halls several rattling clamor up the stairs from the main exit from the main stair they catch sight of you one of them's who eyes widen and says oh it's three ghosts go get the Prince they're here died here and a whisper heads all through the rattling bring the Prince before me what's going for you gotta just go for out this point where is the rat Prince our friend the us hi guys my last lie the stairs part and a wave of rattling x' comes up a wave of rattling parts as they come up the stairs filling the chamber in the edge of the hallway with a mass of fur they part and through the midst of them walks quite proudly the rat Prince he has his bloody blades in front of him and he is wearing a very fancy purple cloak where he got it who knows but he's rocking it with him who is the albino supreme seer squeaks and the and dragging a cart of books and adjusting her glasses scratches followed by a teeming group of several smaller rattling 'he's also carrying books with them hello hello hello my good friends yes yes yes he points to the crown look at that shiny thing very very nice yes yes yes yes you've done so well rat Prince look at all of that you have accomplished so proud you have so

is that what I'm I'm loving it should I just give him the crown after he does this cuz this crowd is like meaningless right guys more of like a even if he kills the queen of Thieves he's still gonna

demon no no no all this time it has been rattled knowing at your ear you did not know you think you know you did not know you did not know so that you let's do it still you do it all for us we have

me ground ground yes yes yes I wrote rock give you prize you're smarter than I gave you credit for you're not getting this crown and you're not going to become the Rat King your choices are to take all of your rattling 's and leave this castle or you can die huh is my castle is my altar for rat got everything you've accomplished is because we allowed it you don't know just how weak you actually are you don't know just how strong we really are now well let's find out roll for initiative good here we go this was oh my god is the regret gonna come from not killing him I don't I don't think I mean the regret came years ago for not killing him that could have been higher coulda been lower oh here we go oh that's that was there oh okay that's better so we're in the hallway right yeah why did I put myself in the front all right I got this story I got this all righty what do we got for bayo 2020 what do that's for Sebastian 1414 what do we got for Pluto 16 okay okay and [Music] all righty with all of my all of my time spent talking with the rat Prince I wanna use I'm so know your enemy alrighty what do you want to know his AC is more or less than 20 or equal it is less and his current hit points higher or lower than 130 or let me just double-check this is good to know his AC is lower than 20 his hit points are higher 130 okay guys but if it's like probably 131 it's at least mid oh I mean the limit does not exist so yep it could be anywhere from 131 to infinite great okay so we got all these big nose isn't here it's right OC first eat kool-aid man's it through the wall oh look a good idea about the rat prince and supreme seer squeaks and scratches episode one guys one foot what the very first thing we were supposed to do this is the ultimate finding your lunch in the bottom of your locker incident alright I was all just worse it was always so gross you're like I should have just thrown it out should've dealt with it but I kept putting it off now I got to deal with it and it's awful history so if only I had spell slots left how dolls is healing uh it is 20 feet like all the other levels okay and then we got a whole ton of rattling hello all this really gotta adjust the shot too for all you fans out there if the rat prints this is your fault this was our doing yeah we can pull those pillars down probably for now just to show the Med the majesty of the infestation okay all right it's fine guys it's fine everything's fine you literally said what's the worst that could happen and then we walked out of the door yeah that's like every other time we've walked through a door and I like to think of it as like our good luck charm yeah exactly yep nothing bad will happen as long as I say what's the worst that could happen luckily I have hit points back okay first up the rat prints the rat prints bounds forward across the Horde of rattling x' towards veil Hey and he moves one square off yep taking his blades as they shimmer with a purple light he attacks veil with his swords getting a 26 and an 18 yes both hit okay it's rude veil you take a total of I'm gonna use 19 piercing damage man can II dodge okay this is so there's two attacks so I have to split them up that okay yes I mean so there's yeah because they apply differently okay so the first attack is ten piercing damage and then the blades are coated and built of delirium and they cut into you dealing seventeen poison damage and twelve necrotic damage so that's one a second so that's one attack so that's a total of yeah so that is a total of 10 plus 12 is 22 plus seven resistant to poison okay so you are immune your is it immune immune from the yes but you are not I supposed to dispel I'm not yeah so you don't take the the 12 poison damage okay okay and you're gonna uncanny dodged the rest okay so the remainder then is gonna be the total of 27 damage which is half to the 13 second attack oh is nine piercing damage and because you're immune to the poison it's gonna be another 12 necrotic oh and then he uses his bonus action to dash back into the hoard like how far back yeah yep oh do I get a know that my reaction would be an opportunity never good that was yep rude and he cries out died I can't take it and yeah it as he moves back it's almost like a teeming it's almost like the delirium running through his veins is giving him in a supernatural speed I think we should go back into the throne room vo it is your turn let me just shoot him first okay and I point out them and I say you're the one that's going to die and I take my crossbow and I get four shots on him okay roll them 17 it's a hit and as the shot lands in a rattling jumps up and takes it in the head and dies ah so remove running the rattling yeah kill them okay second shot mm-hmm more than last time so I'm assuming a hit another rattling throws itself in front of the rat prints and takes the shot hey no shoot the rat prints this time I aim at the seer rat okay no seven as a Miss I'm afraid last one same at the Sierra 19 and another rattling throws itself in front of Supremes here squeaks and dies whatever one is adjacent to supreme serous dreams she's the one in the black cloak whoa come on and I say yeah I can do this all day it's gonna come for you rat prints and an eye a princess more more more wrappings come come come yes yes yes I mean all for a good cause so we're going back to the throne room tonight start to back away towards ya no not that far I still want to keep an eye on them but like yeah okay next up is castle Drakken is it gonna wake up okay Castle Drakon there is a shuttering in the walls and a clamor vayo one of the suits of armour steps forward behind you and as it opens up and the visor opens up and there's a whisper in it access Vale Vale - me it's gone the piece is gone we killed it you did use it we have a bigger problem though I can see they're everywhere they're like a poison yeah we're on antitoxin as much as we can may need a little bit help there's there could be another way how there must be another way how down to me you've got to bring the seals down to me weakly there's not enough time but as he he he grabs his he reaches out with the hands of the armor and the the four doorways along the hallway all fly open there's another stair the servants stair these four yep all the doors fly open and in fact all the doors in the whole hall the whole building just exploded another crash whoa there might be fewer that way go go I'll try to guide you thank you guys did they hear that - did you hear that - yes good one make sure that the doctor repeat myself you know okay did the Sara yes sir well next up is supreme seer squeeks she brings her hands around herself and she casts a special version of the spell insect flag called rodent plague vermin tied and a sea of spectral rats lift themselves up out of the ground forming a whirling mass of biting teeth in the area around the the group of you it's a 20-foot radius my counter spell it would you like to counter spell it yes okay that's I roll it you ought to beat 15 this is just charisma but yeah yeah 23 okay so as this these ghostly rats start to rise out I hold out my staff and with tendrils of darkness I smash the rats away nice okay we're the only ghosts here we do all the ghosts way and scratches squishes is next up in the initiative order and scratches turns to Supremes here squeaks and says players players not enough not enough deep fire had poison instead and she pulls out a vial of some sort of burning substance and hurls it forward casting wall of fire no no my wall of fire Oh what where's it going you stole my move ah all the way down yeah hey cuz it doesn't get some of the rat links yes she's gonna cast it not that deep into the rattling so she yeah it'll go back that way yep so it as the wall of fire appears she [Applause] there's nobody in its area right away okay and the fire damage is radiating out to down across the hallway yep okay so that is scratches pollute oh there's fire everywhere yes and so yeah if you if you end your turn within 10 feet of the wall you take 58 fire damage okay I'm gonna pull out the Javan javelin of lightning and I Huck it at the rat on the stairway I want to try to hit I wanted to go right first I want to hit the lightning on on scratches okay so that it aims her scratches yeah it aims index creatures general direction I want to hit I'm gonna try to hit straight which is the one with the green fire yeah the one to the left yeah yeah yeah or my left you're okay so you have all the railings in the line I think the rat prince is in that line yeah and they have to make what's the DC on the 13 Dex the rat Prince dodges out of the way I get a 21 to hit scratches that hits scratches Genting John how many rattling is do I have in that line it had estimate one two three four - the rock piles count as rattling yeah there's one two three four five six seven eight that was the rapid oh yeah we'll say we'll say seven okay we'll go with eight so so six died as the line of lightning crashes through them six died yeah squishes also fails her save but she succeeds her she gets 17 on her cost she rolls with disadvantage because she's because of mage Slayer hey she fails in the wall of fire and she takes 18 damage okay so I Huck the javelin it comes flying back to me and I'm just gonna fire bang and I'm gonna Huck one at the wrap prints for like a like a 14 that is a Miss and then a 16 at the read prints yeah that is also a Miss he evades it and then wears the watch way Vale where's the servants quarters my point to the direction it was this way yeah through the doors okay so I'm gonna get on get in the Sandra and I start like just doing like the whole bike like hustling all right Sebastian oh do you I I look up at scratches and I look at her and I say oh so you like fire do you and then I hold out the staff and I'm going to quicken while the fire so that I'm also gonna drink a potion okay and as you do so screeches looks back and says yes yes I like fire but not Addie and she casts counterspell getting a 20 on the counter spell check oh that does it right the Battle of wizards oh yeah maddening not good magic that hurts you know that's hurtful to say you're casting that with the staff of power no okay that was me using my spell slot that was a quicken spell okay so with my action I'm gonna drink well okay first of all we're gonna run into here okay and then I'm gonna drink a aqua delirium x d6 + one spell slots so roll a d6 and add one I don't worry let you do

this room waiting for everybody else okay so the Horde sorry guys I thought I have bet the rattling x' rush forward towards Pluto and Elias Drechsel aha all of them swarming upwards when does Alaska he goes last okay there's a lot of rats and I'm having a little bit of a flashback to episode 1 I'm having a huge flashback and I'm super worried and you ever tried to kill like a rat with like a like a sharp object like they're just so dodgy where you're just trying to like stab them with a guy I have never seems like whatever it's like just like totally not related willingness though oh man so there's three on Elias and three on uh oh that's a big mound of rats so that's its large its size large you know I get a 19 a 22 and a 7 to hit okay the 22 hits you take 4 points of the of piercing damage is one of the rattling stabbed you in the shoulder ow Elias Drechsel is hit twice and he takes 10 points of piercing damage as the rattling begins stabbing at him and then several of the rattling is on the back ranks take out some of their spears and they try to throw them at you and Elias as well Oh Elias dodged a 23 and a 22 with the spears ah for a total of 9 damage Elias gets a few thrown at him and he gets crit hit and he takes a total of 15 points of damage and is there anyone else in the hallway as well hey hey oh three Spears got thrown it year and I get a 23 a 21 and 11 I cash shield okay nice oh wait I used a reaction RT I guess yeah before so I take them oh wait I have a 17 sorry say well were the number skins 23 and 19 I think I think I got two hits so I'm gonna say that that's gonna be ten damage okay total as they throw their whales the ones in the back throw a hail of spears down the hallway at at the group of you and as they do so there are lumbering footsteps as to as big-nose and another one just like him lumber up the stairs as nuts I'm like in this little room and I just like peek out the door and I'm like okay and they're out Elias Drechsel cuts down two of the rattling 'he's in front of him and he provokes an opportunity attack which misses him and rushes toward Sebastian let's get out of here this is way too many of them I agree this is true okay and that is Elias and we go to the top of the round with Vail what about the robbers oh okay yes yes yes yes yes can't forget reference no no no the rat Prince cries out go go go get them get them get them as he bounced forward almost bodysurfing across the other rat links towards pollute oh hello and he slashes deeply at pollute Oh Oh getting a 20 and at 22 to hit now I'm gonna use she okay I wasn't sure about using it earlier but I'm definitely into using it now little boy okay and then the rat prince is going to use his bonus action to dash back as well back into the Horde but I believe because of Sentinel you still do get to me a whole baby kill him kill him I get a 20 that is a hit oh so that stops him he's he's back up at the front and then I do because I'm using my javelin still 13 damage and then I want him to make a huge strength safe okay he gets a 17 okay he tied me okay but he's still gonna take wait another four damage nice you won't keep me close nice and

scratches I heard his really fast right now so she was just like a note keeper she know she's mean I got made us very smart yes yes yes do lots of reading yes yes you learn to do it too hmm okay that was really rude I studied this school of hard knocks alrighty there is a slam as the throne room doors shut and looking across the hall pollute oh you can see lies in deceit closing those doors but very very tight it's fair it's fair okay next up Bluto it is your turn bye and I disengage and I book it into the room oh can I can I close the door behind me yes you can Luca and I and I run down the servants they've got deaf fingers and healing and there's a lot of rats and we got to get down there can we lock this door we have a rod in Rod We Trust there's two doors leading into this room we have a rods other one can be in vail like run up and like yeah yeah okay we leave right now to make carbon rods in the ball amazing in the two doors and lock them in place okay you are in my some time you are in the Royal Apartments this room that you have wandered into is a truly incredible chamber it was one of the Kings private studies it is a room lined with bookshelves and immaculate wooden walls that have been carved and painted in all sorts of pastoral displays the workmanship here is amazing although it smells faintly of rotted wood the there is a balcony and with the windows of of glass and wrought iron looking out over the courtyard below or you can see the rattling x' you see coming through the gatehouse is some sort of massive makeshift catapult that the rattling z' might have made and it looks like a combination between a catapult and maybe some sort of cannon but instead of a barrel it's just a massive shard of delirium with a bunch of whirling sort of gears and pieces around it and this this crackling arcane energy surrounding it okay let's and you see it fire towards the dragon they're fighting the dragon what it maybe we should just let the paladins march on the city be like let's see what happens honestly like I want to defend the castle but once the castle is defended let the rattling have the city for now because illyrians are gonna be here in like a week and they're gonna have to fight all them rattling to try to get to this castle that's fair and that'll be really mad when they get here yeah whoever's left that's a much smaller army to deal with that's true maybe so mad so if we let it go to waste we really let this place go when you have two problems that are going to fight each other you just let them fight each other and then you clean up the garbage yeah yeah we're like Switzerland okay survivalist with the doors barred we can drop out of initiative for now what where are you going to go going towards the stairs through the stairs and I wherever those are following there we're following bears come on Elias - my survey oh you have vague recollections of this pathway but there's another set of doors that lead from the Kings study into the dining hall which is the next or the next room back the other way that then from the dining hall lead into a chamber where that connects to the servants staircase the doors in those next rooms are open so you the other two doors that opened up the right like you're gonna have to book it through those if you don't want to draw the attention of the rattling or sneak through or we could sneak through um can you guys be invisible do you have magic I have a distraction you have a distraction and it's not me this time you as you plan this there's a voice in your head um there's a lot of rattling 'he's down here there's a lot of railings up here to your phone or worry you make it to us can you save us yes we're heading down the servants stairwell the servants stairwell we were we're down in a guest chamber I've locked the door with arcane lock which way is the servant stair it's towards the what side of that castles on the north side that's the South Side south side of the castle so so so north is where the stairs are okay North North it's on the north side where are you we're in the middle on the I think we might be below you that makes sense is there any stairways in in the on the room that we're in we're in a bedchamber can you make it north do you have pass wall or any spells that can help you leave are we barred the doors here can you get to us to make sure the way is safe we will do our best we're on our way we're coming I can pass without trace us I pass without tracer it doesn't make us invisible I've reached into my bag of tricks and I go I have a distraction it's an ape and and the ape will carry the deck of card the card into the can I give the ape a card from the deck of illusory you can give the ape a random card and you can activate it I also have the a4 random car okay I also do I know which direction they're going they're stationary the group Eldrick any other group no the when we go through essentially I want to make a noise at whatever direct like the opposite direction of us is using minor illusion okay well the room on the other side of the door is a dining chamber and it is effectively on the map this this room here that is that dining chamber just extends backwards okay we have we haven't built it so there's the door that you go through there's going to be a door immediately opposite it that you think leads that leads to the where the servants stair is okay so you're gonna have to go through that room at the very least and there's the we know there's rattling surround here the that door is open and there's rattling is pouring down the hall yeah so I carry the ape in my arms and then go come on little buddy you're gonna do something magical I'm just gonna run let's run up and as we run through the door I hurl a Abraham Lincoln into the room who then hurls the card into the room further okay the card that you draw is the Queen of Hearts does that correspond and a succubus appears the rattling 's are not and the ape seems to be impressed by this by this configure that appears before it but the rattling czar not and as you run into the room the rattling so fall upon the eight and the succubus almost immediately all of you can are you you're not using stealth or are you using so we're gonna try to do it stealthy how far away are we from the door that the rattling czar coming in 30 feet I want a mage hand the door closed okay you close the door with Mei Chen you pull it shut good you guys okay go you rush across the dining room slammer across the table and you are now in a large waiting resurrection where you can see the staircase leading down words the off the waiting room is a hallway with an open door and as you fit slam the door shut from the waiting room there you turn and you look down the hallway and you meet eyes with a group of rattling so you just turn and go guys run and I'm going in last ok the staircase what do you do Sebastian I open up my cloak of many things and I can pull out the iron door as we run into the stairwell I place the iron door in the hinges and lock it ok you rush the servants stairwell to the sounds of bleat of beating fists against the iron doorway with down one level level lower I turned to the lieutenant commander and I say see what we do we're great at this I hope we get out of this alive oh you're not as in your Lord Commander Wow and I start running down stairs all missed it it allows you go down one level what do you do you are now in a nother room the the room that you were in now coming out from the from the servants chamber the the doorway is hanging open you are the servants chamber opens up into what looks like to be a similar room to the one above although less well appointed the rooms these rooms that are attached to the servants rooms are basically preparation chambers that the servants would bring things up the stairs from the kitchen and then set things up in these rooms to give to either in the upper floors the Royal Apartments and then on this level Vale you know this is the guest chambers and other on other offices so they said they were in the middle Eldrick we're on the same floor do you dare America noise coming off this chamber there is a door leading to the south a door leading to the east and one to the west I think we can make it to you where are the rattling x' compared to your room there down the main hallway they've been flooding the main hall we came off the main hallway and came into the this room it there's a few couches there's a bedchamber off of it it the bedchamber looks out to the south on the windows you send Sen Koli Koli I I send croley out and I kind of go into his eyes are the doors all kind of open and then oh the doors are all shot hmm we can open the one to the hallway maybe Aaron oh I okay wait there's a door to the hallway can I go up to that door and like listen does it sound like there's rats on the other side oh yeah okay wait guys I have an idea mm-hmm I'm using this robe a lot tonight okay I step back and I pull out the patch that is a pit and I place it on this this side of the door and then I'm gonna open the door with mage hand and say how deep is the pit ten feet so you place it on the floor and it opens up into the floor below no that works they might not see it and they'll come rushing in and they'll fall hopefully and then they'll just keep falling into the next floor and then I stand back and I'm like guys I'm gonna go look to go down there though so this is the door to the east right so the West which is the main hallway that you place the pit yeah there's a door to the in this room there's another door to the south and a door to the east as well what about south do we want to just leave that pit there in case they try to come through the door can you move it not now not anymore no it's there I'll just leave it there it's there in case we make noise and they burst through yeah I can all do we saw portions of flying - I know I'm out you know you use yours I have thought we all had one what are you gonna do you don't have time to think let's go in the south door okay let's do it okay quietly you open up the south south door and there they are that oh hey oh like our people yeah oh my god oh hey come in here this way this way watch the pantry it's a large sitting room but there is Eldrick we start beckoning for them tonight come on come on we going there down and immediately there's a few other hooded lanterns with them and a few other caspian yeah and a few of the masks where's Jupiter and solemnly he gave his life for there's no time killing the Feres there's quite a lot of us are we going to be able this with this many of us I don't know if we'll be able to sneak we'll be able to hide ourselves we got to just get down to those of us are there we need to get there are now River Eldrick River and elder ik's Guardians Lucretia oh yeah as well as Queen Lenore and be with another hearing another six soldiers we're within 30 feet I pass without trace let's go hustle come on in 30 feet is Queen Lenore able to keep pace put her on your back because I'll carrier alright you carry her huh come on we're going stop Isis did you see my daughter yes yep she's trying to kill us did you kill her no no kind of tried I mean no no no but I'm sure we'll come to it she wants to settle down castle I think you need to give her a timeout I so wanted to see the throne it looks like we're running out of time let's go all right and I had to the Caspian I'm like look at carrying the Queen such as gentlemen you all should take note and we continue on you head down the servants stair reaching the kitchen the kitchen opens up and as you come down there there are us there you coming out of the bottom veil you're leading yes make a stealth check 36 fawning through the kitchen feasting on the remains of the Minotaur's that were there are about two dozen rattling x' and another one of these massive oversized rattling mutants I might be able to take them all out okay hold up we I I mean it's gonna make a it's gonna make some noise do it it might it might clear us a path do you think we can go by them I mean are they like all over the place they're all over the kitchen finding what scraps of food they can and they're turning on the stove and starting to put slaps of meat of Minotaur on it just let me try this I mean I wouldn't say no it's going to be noisy we're gonna have one chance once I cast the spell we go from the doorway they haven't noticed us yet make a stealth check oh come on surpassed what plus like 10 oh yeah so 26 okay they definitely not have not noticed you with veils magic they have not noticed you into the middle of the room I throw synoptic static and so my eyes turn black and my cloak starts to billow and then also what is the same room 17 okay the middle of the room just explodes with static oh zapped okay nice so elegant savings by either the rattling succeed they're saving throws and the massive right creature fails but I need to know the damage fair enough because it still could kill the rattling that succeeded they're saving throws let's see it is a wave of shadowy psychic energy reverberates through the chamber as the rattling grab their heads and squeal it's deafening and I'm gonna use my last sorcery point to reroll a few of those yep yep that's good that's good there we go baby thirty-six damaged poorest of rattling heads explode from the city can they do it all different times different pitches yeah she's quite catchy but the rat ogre survives and it grabs its head rod okay roll initiative let's just review Shh ha 26 619 everyone but Sebastian beat the rat over what are the two of you gonna do I am going to dash across the room and then take some shots at its butt okay kill it rail we're gonna try I'm gonna take it with how far away like how long is the room the kitchen extends the full length of the bottom of the castle if you recall correctly so it goes the full length so I use my cutting action action to - okay and then I'm gonna take two shots Oh three shots using my dread ambusher so one it's incredible 33 [Music] nice 45 damage leaves it bloodied Oh not slain another shot nice 17 plus 6:23 yeah hit 23 damage okay last shot Oh critical miss want whomp it is still standing pollute Oh what are you gonna do um I'm carrying the Queen okay I flip her to my shield hand okay and I just run at the thing you're gonna die and I'm just gonna start wailing on it hit her with the Kree punch it like I wanted you can use your sword yeah oh yeah you just got the Queen like total action hero mode like she's sitting on your shoulder and I run at him and I get a 16 to hit that is a hit oh you're dead dead 407 16 damage okay it still stands Oh 22 to hit I was brutal 213 damage with two quick strokes you stab it once and then stab it in the throat and and the Queen is Pluto what's happening I'm holding her away so she doesn't get blood on her too and then I pull out the sword and then I go over and they run back we gotta keep runnin keep going okay with that the room is clear and you head through the room into the hallway which has a few large rats eating it what corpses they can find but the group of you as you break into the hallway the hooded Lantern's fire a few quick arrows and slay them good job you stand before the doors to the crypts the columns are not active the railings have not disturbed the door it looks like the railings might have been disturbed the door because there's a very flat rattling in front of the doors it's like just a paste so it looks like the rattling have left well enough alone good call out to your father beyo maybe he can help us oh you can hear us we can open it with the badges yeah but see if he can open it for us yeah it'd be do we have any more badge holders here we have all the bachelor mean we can give one to a shorter badge I'm thinking that we can two of us do the doors and two of us do the the golems and they can stay and watch while we go in yeah can Elias Drexel take a badge well we have three of us plus we need fragile nerves if we're giving them to them too just to open the doors just open the doors open the doors and use the gun guys even Lucretia to the Krrish has the beat we can give her the beads I'll just open

you want to talk about with that let us return to the ruins deep below castle dragon you take the final steps meeting Lucretia Mathias Elias Drechsel Eldrick rune Weaver River their Guardians Queen Lenore and a small band of hooded lanterns and surviving Caspian down into the crypts below as you come down the stairs the the you pass the putrifying remains of the tentacles which wrapped their way around many of them are beginning to putrefy or petrify as the gemstone eyes regard you favorably as you step down into the depths I dad as you come below to the crypts the great pillared hall that was flooded with the Delirium sludge there is a creaking as the tentacle mass of stone bursts forth from the pillars forming a bridge across wow thanks I could use seminars I'm sure that's why he was strong enough that I well there hmm after you mm-hmm I march forward Lucretia Mathias speaks this place is truly like I had never seen the darkness to imagine your father here for so long fighting he is a noble spirit he is most noble person I know let's go we have all the badges yes mm-hmm as you come forward the pillar now is more the shape of a man than ever before it is almost like and as it days you need the arm you can clearly see the form of this rather emaciated man in the pillar holding it up with his hands and it moves and shifts almost like he is a giant in like his body is stretched out over the whole pillar and he looks down shifts and moves and he says you did it veil Sebastien Ludo you destroyed it I feel I feel strengthened but there's still that presents that mind it fires out like ever before it's like it's calling for its servants to help it we must act quickly are you ready to do more work I am I'm sorry Vale I'm sorry I can get you out of here sooner but know that I'm not gonna stop until I do my queen she is here to witness my duty fulfilled I swore an oath to your family my queen to the city to this castle that I would be the steward and keeper of it in all your affairs and I don't intend to break my oath until the end I would give my life for this and Vale I would give my life to protect you - I don't want you to sacrifice yourself for me I wouldn't sacrifice myself I would sacrifice myself for you but it's more than that now I have a duty as well as Lord Commander and I point to my badge to do right by the city and we're gonna do what we can to help protect it against all of these rattling 'he's in the illyrians we're gonna bring we're gonna bring it back he says with the power of the seals I will only have limited control over the city you understand the walls the gates I will bar them and guard them I will be the jailer for the damage of the city nothing more nothing less there will still be violence I know there will be much fighting but the Creator the guardians of the city the golems the gargoyles the doors the gates they will not threaten anyone that walks the city any more they will stand vigil I will not be able to control them beyond directing them who to fight and who not to no humans no one that we know I will not let them attack any innocent anyone that means to protect the city but the monsters that come near them they will destroy that is all I can do that's all we can ask you to do and it's what we need for the next steps I can close and bar the gates and I can wrestle with this thing beyond and I can make sure that this whole it's like the fabric in our world is thin like a pair of pants or socks that have been worn for too long I know good Stewart I know how to sew I'd have some seamstresses that are good I know a few good seamstresses if you will it's not a joke did you just make a joke yes it is all suspect he's a joker but my kitten that makes me happy it won't close you understand we do you'll have to fight another way you plan to close it eventually all that we can ask for is time to figure out how I can give you that time yeah I've already held out for 15 years I'll hold out for a few more promise me yes if I give you my badge these badges they will fight forever and a day until I come back for you I promise I won't give up until you come back even the badges I only need to absorb their power these badges were forged long before they were given a sacred charge to protect the city that will be returned to me now they will still be trinkets items whatever their powers were before they became what they are will remain but they will have no control over the constructs of the city they will have no authority anymore do you understand but you will I will have their authority I understand he reaches he holds one arm up and he reaches the other hand down and extends as the stone crackles it's this massive stone hand place them in my hand he closes his hand and there is a glow of golden power and Queen Lenore places his hand on it on his closed fist and sees it and she says take your charge good Stuart he releases his grip and it's almost like his body has been in Boldin the emaciated stone is now muscled and courted he is a whip thin man but it's whips thin corded muscle he drops the trinkets places his hands up he says I have strength Annelle now go on get out of here I can see you all around I can see all the city there everywhere by the flame they're everywhere they're everywhere we have some unfinished business upstairs though before we head out I go and I reach and I grab the the Lord Commander spaz and I put it back on but I also grab his badge and I put that in my pocket they are mere trinkets now take them this trinket grab but they still have their normal traits but they do not have any more abilities to command the city I hold the his old badge and I say this will always be the most valuable thing I own thank you well I'm proud of you I'm proud of you too I love you love you Lenore says I'm going to stay here I place her down I was carrying her you're gonna stay yes for how long I'm no Queen anymore but I will watch him the pools here will sustain me as they did when I was in the garden I will make sure no harm comes to him I will guard him as he guarded my family Lenore I can't promise that you'll last long just down here in this crypt I don't care the world means nothing to me anymore what if we see Kat again is there anything you want to tell her nothing that she didn't already know thank you for staying with him elder speaks Stuart Johann if you can reach out into the rifts if you can feel the magic around here do you think that you can stabilize what I could teleport us out of here we could be safe we could leave now all together we have one last chance to do something about the rats from the queen of Thieves I don't know what that is yet but if we leave now I thought either of them could sit on that throne johan speaks it is possible that just as the Von Kessler's [Music] stole the city from the von drakken's another could use up the power as long as the crown and throne remain I can do what I can to protect this castle but if there are creatures above Leakey they could undo everything that I've done can you see the Queen can you see Kat can you see he closes his eyes there are rats rats in the throne room there's one that's speaking to the rift she's she's trying to pry it open we have to start now we have to stop that from happening guys Eldrick you said you could teleport I can return us back to the Academy tower take everyone else yeah it will be risky but yo.hannes is attuned to the plains now he might be able to give us safe passage it might now be possible for us to teleport safely to and from the Academy tower well he is the steward of the city well then what would we do about the throne er we can't just leave him to try to battle or whoever sits on that throne could cause the same thing that we just finished fighting we need to stay but that doesn't mean you have to stay unless you have an idea on what we can do in that throne room I have used many of my spells to protect us this far River and I don't have much Lucretia Lucrezia says I can give blessings to you once more but I have already called upon the power of the flame to pull Makeda into our world the miracle this is a time for a desperate miracle I can offer some support though and prayer what if we all go with you I'll fight with you to the end I'll stay says Elias and what see you cats means we'll go guys what we're gonna face on that throne room endless rats and the queen of Thieves I don't know I don't know what to do we have to go up there and stop it do you think we can survive it I know it's what we need to do I have a plan what is it all ears what if we blow up the throne room what what everyone yeah what huh the rift is in there nobody can sit on the throne anyway we have the crown we can give the crown to George it's his crown but your father's in the basement we might be able to just blow up the top of the castle killing the rat prince the horde of rattling the queen of thieves and her men and we get the heck out of there it's a crazy idea I don't know if it's gonna work but it could end this it could maybe is there a chance that my father would be sacrificed well if you were to detonate it on the top level of the castle worst case the upper levels would collapse and bury the crypts none would be able to access the crypts unless they could excavate the castle and repair it were actually making that he would be quite safe in a matter of thinking protect him and it protects the city it stops the rat prints on the queen of thieves from taking the throne I do have one concern though with my own plant and Pluto I think you're gonna have the same concern the rift is a problem we have rattling upstairs talking to the ref they're trying to pry it open that can't happen but that rift is also my only ticket to save Mouse and our only ticket to kill whatever's on the other side Meldrick what happens if we blow it up is there is there another way that we can the week of that rift is metaphysical in nature even the nature of arm of one of our delirium bombs it will damage the structure it will leave a pool of haze will cause erratic magics but it won't destroy that rift so we still have a way through maybe it's our last resort we try to stop the Queen we try to stop the Rat Prince and if we can't do it we don't let anything get out of there how do we get out of there exit strategy remember we'll always have one if we have to use the bomb yes I think we aren't getting out of there your best chance is to throw yourselves off the balcony I do still have a potion of flying I found it in my bag I thought I lost it Pluto I'm gonna try to land on a haystack I mean I feather fall so I can always help you in that land likely it will when you activate the bomb there will be a disruption applied too much magic any magic that you have before you activate it may be nullified nullified and then we have to move with it's our final resort it's our but what about after we activate the bomb can we do magic after yes but by then the bombs effects will be in play I need a fourth level spell slot is what I need give more aqua de Larroque I do I guess now's a good time honey yeah don't want to end with any extra vials in your pocket actually I can also I'm gonna I'm gonna shimmy some around some points during this whole conversation I'm gonna shimmy around salarik I have a ring that's wide open my Academy ring maybe there's something you can put in it I have a fireball spell I have a counter spell and I have my castings of invisibility and dimensioned or dimension tour III haven't mentioned or with your mom's cloak I would take a counterspell very well what level is dimensioned or 4th guys I did just meditate for a little bit and I can say to the bird that you guys can have the benefits of a short rest and Lucretia will heal you as well it changes everything yeah Lucretia speaks a prayer to the sacred fire and you gain the benefits of a short rest and your hip points are restored give any second level spells that you can put I only have invisibility left or arcane lock guys I don't have a lot of smell slots but I can at least turn into an eagle if we thought if we jumped off that balcony okay if we need to jump I and we gonna get out of it yeah we're supporters I need my fifth level spells lot to cast teleportation circle to get us out of here something that's I'll just take invisibility Queen Lenore are you okay with staying down here still yes you'll be trapped if we have to use the bomb then yeah you won't escape like I mean I met em I should be like I am powers of this city and - its fate as a plan-b actually third love speak if we kill the Queen and we kill the rat Prince then there's just an army of rats and lies and deceit and the other Queen is let me kill those guys and we keep we just keep killing I don't know how to turn off Pluto I keep killing with you guys we rocker stop killing not that it's another we have a monster in Hell to kill there is one other way that you could escape once you activate the what's that you could go through the rift but you may not return what do you think guys I think we'd have better chances I was just trying to run I think once we kill the queen of Thieves and the rap Prince and we secure the throne room our decision will be made clear for us because I know not failure when I got you guys we killed everything up into this point I'm ready to keep killing little the bomb kills everybody well so do I I'm like the bomb I'm running low dad and low on gas man I could I'll try if it if it means that much to you I'll try to I'll protect you mom we always but could the dragon fly so I mean I can fly us out I can try are you can the dragon fly faster than you where's he sit down powerful he's pretty stubborn yeah I can I can focus and I can wake up the armor and the golems and the halls get you to the throne room but the Dragons will I can't control it I

the fight what about the Queen are there any signs of the Queen's men are there Queen of fears nothing but a deck of playing cards on the balcony I pick up the deck of playing cards on the back of one of the cards is the words see you next time sorry cards in my pocket and I stand on the balcony of castle Drakon and shake my fist into the air and go curse you queen of Thieves and then I turn I'm like that was pretty dramatic right yeah guys she probably heard it too she's probably right behind us he's right behind us put on your goggles Elias drechsel's check the necks of the several the Caspian and hooded lanterns have fallen at but many but a few remain as Elias Drexel wipes the blood off his face they're running their leaders are gone but there's still hundreds thousands of them in the city we've got our work cut out for us we need to go back to Eckerman mill we need to regroup I need to start to come up with a plan if we're gonna take back Jack in time we're going to need all the help we can get it's gonna be more than just racket I'm now the city is filled with evil filled with rats they'll need more than what they can just find here [Music] we might have to continue to search for help outside of the city I mean we could start scouting looking for more people who could aid us there's there's got to be more people out there willing to help out Drakon hyman our cause as it stands now my father is keeping the city contained we were starting to receive word and even Eldrick was saying the people have started seeing well people started seeing signs of the haze outside Drac and I'm outside of Drac and I really I think you guys have been shipping it out for four months Laoghaire I'm not the haze yeah delirium causes the haze but in such big quantities right who knows who's been buying that delirium as Lee if thieves was sending it out to and who knows what monsters have crept out of the city in the years between maybe we thought things were contained maybe they are but maybe there's more out there still this aldrick on this channel l Birkin River yeah guys the throne room is secure it's done then we didn't have to blow it up alright it sounds like we have a lot more work cut out for us now indeed this might only be the beginning you guys ready to leave this place i turned to one of the guard or I go out to under the guards and I say dad we've done it it gives you a hug oh here comes you like every week and we're gonna have brunch together and I'm gonna make sure you're doing okay she's hugging a sewer armor yeah I don't know what's

castle and return to Eckerman mill place where this whole saga began only a few short months ago guys there's a stoic celebration for the words and thoughts that you shared in the in your travels back what the threats might still be out there the rift is held shut but not closed there are still mysteries lurking in the crater and the queen of thieves is still out there we also have a demonic presence to destroy a mouse to save and Johan to free and an army marching on dragon time I think I need a long rest I think you all have deserved a long rest but at least now at least now we know that the city will be sleeping for now guys this isn't the end but everything has an end and we will get there only a sausage has to ends you're not wrong so we'll do this we'll find a way since we have everybody here at Eckerman mill I think we should start making plans to fend off the illyrian army send word to anybody who we trust out there in the world and try to find some more heroes to help us we're gonna need more people like the people that stand before us here everybody in this room fought for what we have accomplished now but we're gonna need a lot more i've River speaks up I've received some word [Music] something happening in a town in auction wild forest I'll tear haven't they said it sounds like they found delirium haze strange monsters there's things happening outside the city now it's way beyond us now we need all the help we can get who what's the plan then you need a rest but we need help sooner than later we'll have to figure it out next year hey that is where
