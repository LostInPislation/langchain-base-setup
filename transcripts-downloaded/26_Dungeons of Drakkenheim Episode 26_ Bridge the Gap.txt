Drakken i'm is no more struck by falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire a med wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered fifteen years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon hymen caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge good evening and welcome to Dragon hime this is the dungeon dudes weekly fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons campaign my name is Monty Martin running the game as dungeon master and I'm Kelly mcLaughlin and I'm gonna be playing Sebastian Crowe the half elf shadow sorcerer and we're joined today by our good friends Jill denied us playing veo seniya that's a backseat gloom stalker Ranger and Joe O'Gorman playing Pluto Jackson the human battle master also tonight's episode of dungeons of dragon hime is sponsored by skull-splitter dice they sent us these fantastic premium metal dice that we are using at our game tonight and they have been really awesome I love rolling metal dice and yeah they've just been great so if you do want to get a set for yourself you can head on over to skull-splitter dice calm and use the discount code d dudes at checkout to save 15% on your first order when last we left our heroes they were deep within perhaps the most dangerous part of the city of Drakon hime the southward where the great falling star fell 15 years ago meeting with Lucretia Matthias the strange prophet like leader of the followers of the following fire our heroes discovered that these followers initiate the new members of their faith by driving a piece of delirium into their own heart it's very weirded out by this insane religious practice our heroes declined the hospitality of the abbey of st. Selina or the asylum of the Saint Selina depending on who you ask and have decided to make their way back to the Clocktower as that is the safest place that they have nearby a journey though that will require heading back through the South Ward and across champions bridge not an easy trek but the most direct route back to the Clocktower also we haven't been over champions bridge since we started adventuring together used to be a really nice bridge used to be like a central hub for getting across the river well yeah when was last time you were at the bridge gosh years ago but I've tried to sneak clear of this part of the city yeah it's uh it's a little hazy er here than most other places so not the nicest indeed this part of the city is by far the easiest of all even this close to st. Selina's Abbey and the ruined wall outer walls of Drakon Hein the nestled in the South Ward of the city around the crater the haze is the thickest a fog that covers and limits visibility to a hundred and fifty feet at most thus you wander around this blasted wasteland for there is no better term to call it unlike other parts of the city where the levels of destruction weighing off here so close to the crater the destruction is powerful and you can see the evidence of the shockwave that was released as the falling star crashed into the city 15 years ago all the buildings are twisted away from the crater a point that value actually find it's easy to orient yourself now that you've managed to go through the Heysen that you're seeing the pathway from here it does give you a little bit of a sense of where you might be although sometimes you've taken a turn and ended up backwards the way that you came something is clearly strange here and other places you'll see that the devastation isn't just like a blast there are bits of buildings that have turned to glass and even the masonry itself in places is still suspended in midair as if it was blasted off of its building and then forgot what gravity was and just stayed floating there you were outside the gates of Saint Salinas and the long drawbridge that leads into it is rising up as Lucretia Matthias heads back into the fortifications the building itself though lines directly up with the walls of Drakon Heim and the drain' River giving you two landmarks that you could use to navigate your way back if you don't want to go through the haze itself I think we should probably avoid the haze now that we have a good bearing on us now what do you think I I think so I think sticking close to the river might be a good idea to get to the bridge yeah I concur wonderful I mean I'm not a big fan of the haze it's made me do things yes yes yeah let's let's just let's breathe deeply okay not yet not yet and take a look here so you're at Saint Salinas Abbey Abbey slash asylum again the name changed several times over the years and from there if you follow up the Duran River heading against the the stream itself obviously you're not gonna swim in the river or is that yeah no no you're gonna go along the banks okay so you will first actually come to temple bridge which is another crossing point along the way that you could take champions bridge lying far closer to the clock tower itself so you do have two options for bridges that you could use to cross the city what I'm worried about is temple bridge leads us right into slaughter stone square which we've been there before yeah that is that is a big no-no yeah and after being really tired might not be good to run right now I'm a little exhausted from all the the haze walking and I don't know almost joining a cult so yeah yeah real jebecca in you almost became glass people yeah I got I got I almost became made of glass which was not something I planned to do today no no no are we worried about I don't know more glass zombies do we know anything about what creatures lurk in the southward ah I'm not really sure I again haven't really come past the southward very often so how long are we away from the clock tower traveling by regular speed traveling by regular speed as long as the terrain is favorable you could reach the clock tower within an hour of travel okay um I can at least help us be a little bit sneaky while we're going through with some spells that I know okay so if we want to take it at a normal pace at least we'll be a little bit quieter you'll have to move at a slower pace if you want to move with Stella yeah yeah it'll take about twice as long as you move let's talk even if we can get across the bridge then at least we know our way on maybe less less dangerous streets then maybe what we've come across here yeah this whole area is unfamiliar and I think it's best to approach with cautioned I'll be quiet rather than clong clong i'll clink-clink my way but I'm ready to kill anything so you're gonna proceed with stealth yes bored okay so it'll take longer but it may be safer yes we're gonna go out along the river to the second bridge that will take us to the market square okay sounds good to me is there anything that you want to do beyond making are you going to cast any spells to aid that I am going to cast pass without trace okay alrighty so with that do you set out yes I mean I'm ready to yeah your I catch up we're already I've already had as usual my pace is like don't fall too far behind because if you fall more than 150 feet behind then we won't be able to see each other anymore yeah I can't see most things so I live in that world should we like to stay within 30 feet of me anyways should we have like a buddy system like should we attach rope should we hold hands all that we just walk together okay so we start walking through the haze holding hands well yeah I skip a little bit actually more like hold your hand like this I'm like not really a hand holder I skip that's fine it's really skipping yeah I don't trust you and plate armor it's not if we're being quiet heading along the east bank of the dran river through the southward our collection of piers and docks that service the dran River of course as an inland city large ships don't come to Drakon Heim but the drown river is wide enough that many boats and trade craft would use this in the heyday of the city especially as a means of transporting things into the manufacturing hub of the southward whether it was or timber raw materials and more and you can see in the distance from here well the pea-soup of the haze behind you that hangs over the southward itself is especially thick the depth of the river itself because the city's been built up over the banks of the river afford you some vision just making out the opposite side of the drown River which itself is roughly 500 feet wide so you can just make out the opposite edge and see and as the mist hangs over the water that in the distance you can see temple bridge from here and veil you can already spot the temple bridge is not in good shape parts of it have crumbled away and judging on this it could be possible to make it make your way across looks like someone has put up some boards between parts where the the bridge itself gave way as a kind of a makeshift way across so there's still some way of getting across it but it has is definitely worse for wear from here though you cannot see champions bridge nor can you see too much further up the river itself as the the haze continually almost runs off carried on on a low wind into the river itself you head along through the piers shipyards past warehouses and other buildings for a little bit of time before you come close towards temple bridge and I'll have each of you rolling d6 three four - okay Travel goes well Vail you're able to lead the group away enough from the thickness of the haze since you're taking the reverb it's enough that the deep haze doesn't affect you right you're still in the haze but I'm not gonna ask for any constant Constitution checks because it's you've got enough fresh air that it's not going to fully affect you yet just breathe over the river not into the opposite magician walking along the edge going I fall in the river you almost fall in the river I grab you which one of you is leading the way yeah okay they'll give me a perception check twenty-one disadvantage heading along this way as you come towards temple bridge the destruction is becoming more apparent than it ever has been before there are giant chunks of rock and masonry that have flown through the air and crashed in piles into buildings as if whatever buildings that were underneath the great crater were just chucked through the air and massive pieces of Earth and rock or thrown up as they do you're traveling during the daytime but it's entirely possible these might be pieces of the meteor as well and they could have delirium in them in fact you pass by a section of rocks that bear the streaks of the meteoric iron but there are chisel marks all in the rock someone has excavated the Delirium from sono delirium but the iron ore yeah with all of these rocks around do you think we have a minute to look and see if we can bank on some delirium if we can scrounge some I mean it might be worth earn it might be worth like 10 minutes yeah but at the same time I don't know like are we in a rush we have until what tomorrow to meet with the hooded lanterns and the paladins we can look around but it looks like someone's already been here to take all the Delirium someone's already been smart enough to check this area scavenge so yeah this close to the edge of the river these would be big deposits of delirium that would be the easiest to retrieve past the fog bank though who knows what's there yeah I mean we can go as long as again think about it my my magic only lasts for so long so we can look but we've gotta be hasty about it you're called navigator I mean it'd be worth a pretty big salmon if we did butoh what do you think um I get out my monocle and my Mason's tools I want to take a look that's how I and I sure the other glasses I just ripped like I just broke glasses in half it's just I don't even remember where we left them on the Statue right so you just found more glasses and read to a monitor I just looking for the costumes look I'm DIY okay if it helps you figure out if there's delirium around and it's free it's for its for squinting at Rock and being like oh yes your home down you better go see an eye doctor what I'm really unbalanced I cuz I just I don't know the prescription guess we have good eye doctors yeah I hope so I have coverage it's travel I have travel coverage well I wouldn't trust the one so as you pass a bridge and see these large deposits of stone do you continue along the path of the river or are you gonna head further in for the off chance that you can find this veil you know that if you head directly east from here you can follow the road that leads from temple bridge and that should connect back up with champions way which then if you follow champions way or whatever's left of it would take you back to champions bridge you're just becoming really close to the great quick crater I mean what's the worst that could happen the worst that could happen is that we have mutated by the giant crater and that's a risk I'm willing to take with Sebastian I'm now reading about our decisions yes it easy to come back but are we we're gonna have to we're going into the haze more we're already pretty exhausted are we gonna be true it might not be worth a little bit of money just to die slowly by delirium poison yeah I guess I'll put my monocle away but it's good to know that we can come back and okay take a look when we're maybe a little bit more rested yeah let's keep we ignore the trap that Monty said thus defeating you fine don't seek out my fantastic treasure well you didn't say fantastic how much delirium where can your monocle see how much delirium is in the haze that's if it's a lot my monocle tells me that my one eye hurts all right so we're gonna continue okay okay you move they forward past the devastation as you come towards temple bridge the streets here the cobblestones of the streets are covered over by a thick layer of ash and dust and dirt so the city streets the lawns that were here all the debt reduce all the dust left over from the meteors collision has settled over this area covering up most of the cobblestone streets and leaving rubble and dirt everywhere as you come along the street now here horse hooves and footsteps coming along the street you don't see anything it's coming from the direction of the thicker haze does it sound like it's coming towards us yes guys I hear something what is it who's everybody hi do we hear it give me a perception check and I got 10 you're out 16 Sebastian you you hear it there's voices there's people talking common yes how many it might like how many horses does it sound like multiple you heard the horse who's one maybe two several voices though conversing I say I say that we retake cover and it's wait to see what we're up against here take cover is there anywhere that I can go up and climb to get a better Vantage yes there is there's a large ruined building that you could climb up and take cover and it looks like it must have been once a saddle makers shop should we all pile into this ruined building and just like peek out and wait for the horses to come yes I'm gonna get on top of the roof where I can get a better vantage point you guys stay down here website listen for porkchop real scurry inside as you scurry inside the building coming out of the haze is a large group armed some of them are carrying crossbows others are carrying Mason's few act a few axes and one of them is leading a horse that has been laying and laden with several large satchels the horse is in a scene sickly-looking it almost looks like it might die at any moment but the people are walking proudly and strongly and emblazoned on their shields is the symbol of a falling fire it looks like there's about almost ten maybe it doesn't open where where do we stand with these guys we just came from their place I'm on the top of the right I can't ask you that we like they're not enemies if they probably have delirium in their hearts that's why they look so good so now I'm starting to think this maybe is it you kind of potion maybe our coal I think our goal is to get rid of the haze said you don't don't drive the delirium in the night I don't know man it was a was a convincing argument you like they look great I just want to say that they don't look sickly retire look way healthier than we do yeah many of them do there are to secure all Jerry Hale and healthy looking warriors that are proudly bearing the delirium in their chests the juts out from where they're from their hearts they're carrying what looked to be large pickaxes and with them are then a larger group four of them are carrying shields and vases but on the horse you can see that there are several pickaxes as well and then there's a group of others that are carrying crossbows and other satchels of supplies and Dayo as you catch a glimpse of it it looks like the horse might be laden in its saddlebags with pieces of delirium it's carrying delirium that they've harvested are they which direction are they coming from the direction of the big crater yes it's just an informational moment gluto do you think or I mean like we have no reason to attack them well like it would be sort of our way to attack them yeah I mean I we could stay hidden if we reveal ourselves we might be I mean we mean them no harm and we saved several of them I can also I could make it look like I have a piece of media of my chest yeah I guess yeah we can just let them to go by how I'm going to feel like talking to anyone I was kind of having a me day and [Music] those days too yes you know I'm a little exhausted we just came from an insane asylum full of people who were trying to tell us to drive this stuff into our chest and we technically like we're like no thank you yeah and now if we talk to these guys they're gonna be like have you heard the way of DOC driving to Laramie we did the whole we don't make your props we're aren't so are they around the back of the horse guards in delirium there is a woman that is leading the horse she is dressed in the robes of a flame keeper as the the followers of the falling fire garbed themselves so rather than the traditional white and blue garments of other priests they wear black white red instead she is leading the horse and then surrounding her that are the ones with the shields the larger ones with the pickaxes and the groups with the cross was bringing up the rear and they're walking along along the street that this saddle maker shop is on are they close enough that I can make out what they're saying or what I have to move closer if you want to wait as they pass you probably could yes let's let them get closer I want to hear their conversation I want to see what they're talking about what they're up to maybe we can just gain Intel by staying quiet and listening well I I'm waiting for pork chops so I'm down and it was wait okay I'm also waiting at the top hoping that the guys at the bottom also the group passes by and you hear the chatter amongst them saying one of the shield carrying one says to the other one of the ones carrying a crossbow we did well today we have brought much of the of the stones back this will will go very very well many more are coming to join us as well I've heard that even amongst the the Knights of the silver order there are those that are hearing the truth of our cause and joining us even a few of the old city guard they had even taken up our cause too and joined us it is truly miraculous they are coming and they're going to stay with us and help us in our great purpose you know say this is this is good but they they agree they say that it is truly a time for rejoicing people are understanding what we're doing here as they pass by I can I need stealth checks from all of you with disadvantage due to your exhaustion add 10 for past lectures 31 20 to 15 as they pass by the ones with the crossbow look at a court they scan across the building they scan across they look like they know how to move through the ruins in a group they're scanning for threats around around them and they seem to pass by Intel in a moment the flame keeper a flaxen-haired woman locks eyes with no and it turns out I'm just standing up staring right at her yeah but I ducked under the window and you just stood there staring at them and I give her a very mild wave what part of stealth I was getting a cramp and I had to stand up we were crouching for too long and you know how might I might my thighs get I instantly I cast minor illusion so that it looks like there's like a purple glow coming from ludos chest okay how are you are you going to attempt to conceal the fact that you're casting a spell I'm hiding underneath the windowsills does minorly even have verbal components just somatic just somatic okay and and material okay okay so you can't you can stay hidden as you as you cast it so I make it look like he has purple into his chest as well okay and I stay down where I am okay make a make a deception check for your minor illusion 19 okay pollute oh you see the the illusion up here but of course it it's it's in your space but you're going to need to sell this so I will give you advantage on the next deception check that you make because because Sebastien's have helped you so you stand up you see this it it's shooting through your chest and looks like it's coming out of your arm so it looks kind of strange like like because he's wearing plate armor it's the best I could do I freaked out okay so you start scream do you start screaming I'm gonna I'm going to Hale friend she looks at you and she says light be with you who are you light be with you I am Pluto Jackson acolyte of the falling fire I thought that's what the acolyte maybe it does you're doing they just are you with it another group that is I got this new chest wound slash homage to your people got it last night I met your leader read the book heavy heavy read want to let you know that I'm just heading to the Clocktower make it a deception check twenty technically nineteen ok I'm not very deceptive she says have you come out here alone I am keeper Amara you are not with another flame keeper you're not with any of our others you don't have any give any equipment oh you you know what I'm new to the whole shebang but I fee can I tell you how great this gem in my chest feels this armor that you wear why um it's a habit because I've worn it so much that I have to keep wearing it but my child it it weighs down your soul yeah it's just it's kind of like your favorite pair of boots you just gotta keep wearing them well this has been a but interesting line of questioning you must you're a strange fellow and team would you know that our path is to give up such material attachments in the name of the great age to come I must have sped through that part in the book I guess I read fast but I didn't take it all in you know you know when you have to read a book a few times to really kind of get the message like I didn't pick that up on the first peruse oh my child come come with us you I can't I can't leave this exact position I'm standing but hey you know what I want to just say that it was great to meet you and yeah peace light be with you make another deception check it's gonna work one wait he's you never rolled advantage from my help before he did B but he's got disadvantage because he's exhausted no I'm not exhausted oh you're not exhausted I'm fine okay you didn't roll advantage on that last roll I got a 20 because I'm a you got the highest that you could get and then now I got a 1 so what is that so you were already granted okay no no and the reason why cuz she's really suspicious suspicious or yeah because I am I actually hopped down from the building and I say my liege we must go on our journey who are these people and I turned oh yes my muscle I know as Vale steps out the others raise their there the others raised their weapons and shock hold your fire it's a very dangerous territory you didn't tell me we'd be getting into something like this my leash they I think they are just a little so they're a little on edge to meet you I did not expect to meet you yeah here well who is this oh I'm I'm Vale and Pluto is actually taking me on my journey to find my crystal so we're journeying together it's part of our our right to to find the light oh you have found another I work fast I knew what you were worried that we for she's at a back seat you were worried that we would judge her we are we are accepting people all will feel the light I'm used to changed my true shame I start crawling away from the window so that I so that if I do decide to appear I'm not immediately next to a vassal so I start like crawl to another area of this ruined building so that I could step okay yep 24 okay the flame keeper says this is fantastic you shall travel with us all together as we head back to st. Salinas yeah it's we're so busy and we have I have to help Val get her cannot deter from the path of light leading us towards my heart crystal we walk the same path we will lead you there we're not ready for Saint Salinas we must go on a different path I like okay persuasion chair and now the other review we're about to it's gonna happen you guys need help 10 she says I sense that there is something amiss with you to come you do not have certainty within your heart you are wavering it's that you come come come close now and one of the one of the two men that the high taxes approaches you and reaches out to pull you close is that Pluto Jackson I step out as I live and breathe you're alive once again the others raised their weapons and the whole group is very confused they'll Senya you're here too I am guys I was just heading to the clock tower there's a lot of stuff that needs to happen there right now is my crystal there your crystal is there I saw it I didn't know you were still looking for it yes have you guys heard the way of the light why do you think we're going to find a crystal Pluto you can see already has it yeah just right in my chest nice it looks really good on you Thanks we heard about Lucretia and her her awesome new falling fire thing that she's got going on the delirium is so great you know great all of its really great did you read the book I've hiked I got I got one read under my belt oh my brother it's it's so good to see you here in Drakon hi it's great to see you too Ben it's been how long has it been it's been at least an hour I think I think much longer Pluto yeah that's why I wanted to really under ball the flaky boys what is going on this is some kind of trick she says to the others they're trying to lead us into an ambush of some kind why would we what sorry who are you guys I these two but I'm not sure who you guys are you are trying to deceive us what what is your purpose here I'm just heading to the Clocktower I'm trying to find a crystal I have to stand right here perfectly still you are not of our flock you are liars well so much for not being judgmental yeah you guys are really judgmental no you make a mockery of our faith how so it's Sebastian you can you can show them my true my true shame I turn the glow on his chest green the I put the wrong wrong the larger man its approached pollute oh says this is art is this are you true nay he reaches to touch the shard and his hand passes through it I might disable my relation this is sorcery I have a dare you my secret shame I was not brave enough to take the plunge I I carry with me a weight greater than a rock in my chest it's the inability to follow through in the faith flame keeper Hana speaks a the flame keeper she speaks up and says this is a trap this is an ambush we have to leave now we'll carry on our way okay see ya like we're just we're just passing by yeah we were worried that you would kill us if we didn't if we didn't follow the faith you're not going to attack us no why would we attack you no we just came from seeing Lucretia and others true heading towards our tower that part's true too we panicked because most people we meet out here are usually gonna try to kill us yep why did you lie to us then or judge us or try to jam rocks in our chests we're not being ready to do that yeah wait time where are you out here scavenging no no we're just going to our clock tower that's it's a place one of the men says do you have any of the sacred stones on you sometimes do you have any of them now I think we're all out I think actually I picked up one so you can have it and I pull out one he takes it sorry didn't realize there was a monopoly important glowing rocks yeah we just thought they looked pretty you don't mean to scavenge to steal destiny in the name of profit we're just trying to get home we're just trying to get home fine nice Lucretia she'll vouch for us so how's dragon hime these are dangerous times agreed obviously we almost got stabbed but if you do not hold the true faith do not mean to deceive others says one of the men that is a grave sin it is not for us to be your judgement nor executioner's but there will be a price and a reckoning to come for the for the deceitful in the next stage noted to keep that in mind when you're pointing your crossbows and pickaxes around to different people our purpose is righteous mmm-hmm well we'll be on our way well see ya telly creature we say hi but not actually and with that the group parts ways with the Delirium piece that they take from you guys I'm liking them less and less every time we there are kinda bullies there they're bully your spiritual bullies they think that they're so right and like the only reason we lied is because the last time we talked to one of them they told said hey you got a jam rocks in your chest to be accepted by us yeah you know who else thinks they're always right to their priests are literally cut from the same cloth you know I see where it comes from yeah but there I don't know like there was that slight part of me that heard the words that Lucretia said and wanted it so bad but at the cost of jamming a rock into my chest and joining like they don't seem super friendly they don't seem to respect my individualism yeah I don't literally were judging me for being at a back seat yeah they said they wouldn't they said they thought that they would judge you for being at a back seat but they won't which means that at some point they judged you for being atabaque see like right then that there them saying it I think somebody being like I don't judge you for what you are is somebody saying like not about judging they thought about judging yeah so you proceed further along the coast along the the banks of the river sneaky sneaky cuz we're doing so well at that okay as you continue you can all roll me a d6 so they don't like the seat so let's we won't play the to see one five six okay will do any more Dale moves give me a perception check 14 okay you head forward through the ruins and moving ahead with stell I'm continuing to do so mm-hmm you find yourselves along the edges of the water in a series of old ruined tavern buildings warehouses and some small Smithy's and make a spellcheck Vale ollie 23 25 16 okay so Pluto as you walk forward give me a perception check as well now you ain't clean clean kind of thing 21 no you see it and it sees you at the same time I contact it's not quite an eye contact situation Sebastian one more stove one more cell check yep from you Knut self-perception sorry get a 6 ok little here's what you see did you travel forward a bank of rolling fog comes forward and in amongst the ruins here stepping out from around a corner is a hideous misshapen creature it moans lowly as it stumbles forward into the street right in front of you almost accidentally seeing the group they the it sees pollute oh but the way that's that this goes down is Sebastian doesn't see it veo doesn't see it but it doesn't see Sebastian Baio either Pluto is the only one that notices it but it notices political same time little are you hungry was that your stomach can it be both of what a creature is a miss shapen monstrosity standing about twelve feet tall and it looks like it is composed of four creatures that's right it looks it has four sets of limbs pardon me because it looks like it is composed of two doc working ogres that were fused together it has a head that has a head on the front and the back and are this large bulbous mass and its limbs a pair of arms a right arm and a left arm hang off the top of its body one out the front of it and then another out the side with these three limbs and then it stumbles forward with four legs and you can see that like it has it looks like its torso is two torsos that were thrust together and spines of metal and glass and bits and almost embedded bits of and flecks of delirium are in its stony hide as it lumbers forward and as it does so Pluto you notice that there are several other humanoid forms not unlike it in the area around you as well you can always us you can all roll for initiative oh no no it's probably uglier than the one we saw at Oscars house mm-hmm you and me haven't seen it it hasn't seen us Pluto I think you're just getting spotted I'm gonna distract it [Laughter] yeah yeah it even with Pacific trees I am NOT stealthy that was you out of the +10 right oh yeah [Laughter] plus one yeah I've been rolling so furnished Sebastian and Vale I'm gonna have the two of you place yourselves on the map where you're hiding do the two of you are still hidden from it I don't know where they're gonna be so over here yeah and then I'll place the creature and then we'll play Spoleto okay I'm gonna stare at them oh it's big you big it's not seem fair we were all close enough to still be having a conversation and traveling through the streets but you were up ahead a little bunny it's I just picture us like we're walking as a group and we're saying stuff from her laughing and then I look around and you guys are gone and then I look over there's a monster I'm like oh I'm alone again how am i alone where are you guys you guys are just naturally so sneaky that I'd lose not we're just like being stealthy and you're not so let's roll for initiative 14:14 prevail 20/20 bastion 19 what time of day is it it's the afternoon should really travel more tonight is that more dangerous for you guys yeah me with dark vision I should just try to get some dark vision if I got dark vision yeah it would make things a lot easier I get more magic I may be able to give you darkness maybe maybe there's like a goggles yeah I can get goggles we'll have to get you a pair yeah it'll be part of like the shirts yours or what if I got something okay so see like a monocle in the first round Sebastian Vail and the other smaller creatures are surprised but the large one and Pluto are not so pollute Oh as it comes around the corner you are the first to act I yell uh Cronenberg and I run it I run at it and I draw my spear doesn't cut it hi I stab it and I crit go spoke Rhett I I panic run and cuz I only know how to either talk to it or die and I am dying okay this massive creature I'm talking to it what did I say just saying words okay we're just like where are you running to and that conversation and Pluto screams and runs into the fog okay so you rush forward in the fog spotting this horribly misshapen beast and you cleave into into it splitting through some of the flesh and bone 4:15 damage and is it large it is a large creature I'm gonna do trip attack okay so make a strength saving train yeah okay it has four legs so it's difficult to trip oh so he gets a 17 oh okay and he takes an extra four damage okay and then I'm gonna hit it again and I'm stabbing it with my my sword PPS would you accept a twelve uh that is a hit okay for nine more damage it's a massive creature hitting it as like a broadside of a barn and this time I'm gonna do nothing okay the massive beast rears back and screams out and you can hear that the two sides of its head seem to have be having an argument with each other in some sort of gibberish language like one side of the head cries out something one's ha side of the head cries out another thing but then in in the midst of all of it it brings it puts both of its left arms on this one mace that it's carrying and both of its right arms on the other bit of this tree stump or masonry and slams them together at you at the same time no getting a nineteen and a nine miss so it swings both these around I duck and you duck and there's just this clamoring sound as the the two weapons slam together but managed to but you managed to avoid I guess you would have liked had to deflect them out of the way somehow is your shield because yeah that's one of them and I put it into the other nice at the end of the round you can see Vale and Sebastian there are several lurking shapes coming out of the ruins around you are several other misshapen creatures that look like the remnants of various people almost many of them look like common folk but that they have been mashed and changed into one another so you can see that one hobbling forward chuh is a woman that has been merged in much the same way as this larger creature with a dwarf and the two of them are hobbling together at you screaming out in pain and with this grotesque cries another appears to be two other men that are conjoined together back-to-back others another looks like two people that were embracing that were fused together on the front and they're warbling forward all of them are carrying shards of glass or clubs and some of them even even one of them is almost still trying to carve itself in half to separate its own two halves like the top part of it is trying to carve the other half of it off and as it does so it does so it finishes the wound and then it holds itself back together again as they rush forward Sebastien you are the first to act hey oh I think we're surrounded can I see the big guy yeah and where you are yes you can okay so I'm gonna run forward up here and I am going to try to web the big guy in between like the rock and the building okay spray wet all over he's stuck right where he is so that Pluto can just wail away on them so this massive streaky sticky webs kind of spring out from you and try to lash him against the side of the crumbling don't yeah it goes right over Pluto's shoulder and just expands out nice all over the creature cool so he'll make a dexterity saving throughout the start of his turn going to place the web template on the on the Lord is there anything else from you Sebastian i duck in to those rocks there okay next up is Pluto I'm gonna keep wailing on him but I think he's not webbed yet right he is not restrained by the webs yet it's got a weight first they're just kind of appearing they're 12 hits right yep 4 10 damage and so I'm gonna kind of cut at his belly and then I'm gonna kind of step on the rocks and try to go for like the upper torso doing the work and I miss I miss spectacularly so you cut in in towards him slicing him at the belly he seems almost the pain that this creature is in by being two entities fused into one body is greater than even the pain of your weapon as it cuts cuts into him it doesn't a say his screams at all his emotional pain yeah and I'm gonna try to knock him down knocking dr. Brown knocking him 18 I get a natural 20 okay with that we return to the creature who is gets a 8 on a saving throw against the webbing he gets wound up in all that webbing and he cannot move very well and he brings his weapons forward still trying to smash at Pluto with disadvantage on his first attack although that will still be in 18 I think that's not enough and the second one though is 8 20 that hits so he muscles forward and you dodged out of the first one the second one slammed you right in the head oh and it's like a bell ringer your helmet shakes and your perceptions are dulled for a moment as you take 14 bludgeoning damage and that was the May the mace yeah mace to the face oh that's the worst place for a mace such a disgrace beyo it's your turn okay I'm start by activating my feelin agility with my dread ambusher and my goal is to get all the way across up these rocks and use a little bit of my climbing speed to get on the second floor of this building okay how tall is this building this building reaches up to a height of 30 feet and its highest although the top that's the top of the Timbers okay just there and then I take out my bow yeah I take my shots he is restrained in the web so yep yep okay sneak attack oh it's Nick attack ten so Sebastian has lined up the perfect shot you get you rush up to the what happens is you're rushing up and you just you are too quick off the shot like your position hasn't been fully established as you come up the top and the shot just narrowly goes wide as he's thrashing in the web's take my second shot that one is gonna get a seventeen that hit that's money actually d8 with my dread ambush sure [Music] 25 damage so the shot hits him in one of his two jugulars and there is a spurt of blood erupts and it's like a bile then comes out leaving him bloodied I took my last shot 12 it's enough to connect you yeah I hit with a few 12 that's good the second shot hits him in the shoulder although there's four shoulders one of his many and I want to use my bonus action too if I can hide using my cutting action the position that you're in you're still being directly observed by two by at leasts by several creatures - further in yes you could all right I'm dashing further in to get to the window at least set up a sniper shot okay finally the the misshapen mass of creatures shamble forward one - how far can they go with its four legs it bounds up into the building and rushes right towards way out does it reach her it does dashes the other one bounds forward I'm running on boat all of its legs and hands like it drops down almost like a creepy spider and rushes forward and dashes right up to Sebastian this is my worst nightmare the other one in the building there leaps to the top oh and another rushes up to the last one rushes right up to pollute Oh hello okay the one at the top comes up up and it just Lords and works oh and spits downward from both of its mouths at Sebastian sending a horrible mass of sticky acidic goo hurtling towards you since its elevated it does so with advantage oh no I'm being boarded on getting a critical hit you look up and it gets in your eyes Sebastian you take six poison damage and you need to make a constitution saving throat and with its second attack it's a 13-2 hit that's can I cash shield yeah I cast you okay but the assets already in my eyes and I got a 19 you are not poisoned so in a panic the the acid goes in my eyes and I immediately throw up a shield and I'm just there like okay and then the other guy can't hit me because of the shield but I also can't see what's going on and I'm freaking out as I'm pulling the goo out of my eyes that came out of his stomach yep just so you all have that anyone that came out of his stomach thanks Pluto thank you it wasn't out of a pile or anything it was out of his stomach yeah okay smells like it the other creature comes up be towards pollute oh and as it does so its limbs extend longer than they should almost as if an X and elbow ended up somewhere in the other arm of one of the creatures and it swipes at you hey get out of here it gets with its two attacks it gets a 17 and a 21 to hit 21 hits the 21 hits for eight bludgeoning damage and the as the arm comes down the the triple-jointed arm wraps around a and you are grappled and left restrained what it's got me Oh help me push gorgeous Sebastian it is your turn oh okay yeah cool so I finish rubbing the the acid file out of my eyes and oh goodness I'm going to just there's the guy in base contact with me and I'm gonna try to blast him with a fire bolt I actually do need a concentration check as well right Webb's concentration 22 okay you're good so I'm gonna try to just blasts the guy in front of me with a fire bolt okay you do so with disadvantage because he's right in front of you 12 that is a hit they're just normal folks where they don't have any armor on they were normal folks so normal these are just your normal abnormals their neighbors just trying to say hi to us having that's gonna be 14 damage on him ouch so I I literally hold my hand against his chest and just blast fire and yeah as I'm like falling back against there's a go flame it the attack leaves him bloodied but not destroyed nuts they'll help Pluto it's your turn so weird third arm guy is gonna be grabbed yes and you were restrained by the grab and is it a bony hug like is it a kind of a gross it is extremely gross and very uncomfortable like those awkward hugs from people that you only sort of know that lasts a little bit too long I you can tell how uncomfortable and so I'm going to do so I'm like I'm with him yeah he's grabbed me yeah but I grabbed him yeah yeah like that when the world hugs you hug back and I'm gonna just I want to throw him into the web okay so you want to attempt to grab him and throw him in into the web cuz I'm strong okay so make his strength an opposed tranqs tech check to try to grab him straight up strength yeah 22 I have an 18 so there's a quite a wrestling match occurs but you are able to pull him around into the the webbing he's still got a grab on you though okay yeah can I can I can I get out of his grab if you haven't do you want to use your action surge to break out I'm happy a piece in the web okay he is in the web now yeah okay and he else nope okay enjoy the web loser I panic I got I got panicked when he grabbed me so you push him into the web so you're restrained he might be restrained the Etten's restrained and the horrible the this horrible monstrous over like creature comes around and it's gonna smash you and now the disadvantage that he had is canceled out by the advantage because you're restraining out as well so he makes this two attacks it would really help if I didn't roll with two and a three though Thank You skull-splitter so he tries to smash his way forward and clobber you but both the attacks go completely wide and as you wrestle forward you managed to evade the swipes and because he's probably trying to not hit his friend right doesn't look like it oh I assume no I had that he's just trying to miss his friend no with that we go to veo so via one of these creatures is right up to you and had you cornered in this room holy macaroni and I use my bonus action to cast as ever strike okay see you I jump out the window but rake my claws along the building - kind of like steady myself down there is a window right okay okay and then five more feet with my start running back towards furthest you just you just go wherever you want and I still fire at the big guy in the webs okay big ol web shot yep yeah you got him Vale sixteen that's a hit we're wrestling you got it you got Vale twenty five ruptures his other jugular deprived of oxygen to his brain he collapses in a heap of flesh and webs and blood and it's everywhere so you like still hanging in the web yeah yeah just just draining out from there like a marionette all over yes then I heard Pluto show help me first him okay oh you get advantage right cuz he's in the webs or he hasn't been restrained by the way I'm jabbing him you are grabbing him but your your grab doesn't restrain him okay yeah I'm afraid it goes wide sure I got the big guy yes yeah shear as Pluto is getting rattled and I'm getting nobody nobody cares right now like still dealing with a bit of a situation here Vale okay with that the the creature that is in the web's is not restrained by them and he manages to push himself forward out step out of the webs and as he does so he brings you into a deeper hug crushing you close ludo and because he's he's got you he hits automatically and you take ten points a bludgeoning damage he just grabs and crushes the one rate up in front of Sebastian just goes to bite you Sebastian getting a 22 and at and hit one of them hits for a big old for damage it's just one of the mouths it's just you have a mouth bite why do I keep looking up and it chris is this guy gonna know so you get bit just in time to look up and see more of this horrible bile fall down towards you you take nine points of damage from that attack and then the other one goes completely wide width so I got to do a couple concentration check yeah that's 13 and you're good and the second one is going to be 17 okay the other rushes out back towards veo and as it does so it holds itself in inwards and sends an arcing projectile off towards veo look out it stings getting a 22 head oh yeah close your eyes for 9 points of poison damage and both of you need to make Constitution saving throws against the poison oh yeah exhaustion doesn't apply to the saving throw a three you're good one you want okay you both managed to slough off the horrible poison we go to the top with Sebastian puts his goggles on that'll help I can't actually see them oh man okay um I'm going to I'm just gonna try to fire bolt this guy in front of me again okay with disadvantage right that's correct 15 that hits once again you wrestle back at them as you bite you you place your hand on her shoulders and fire the fire bolt at point-blank range as I do and it's going to get a beautiful yeah 16 more damage it just tears down the spinal cord of this creature and it slumps to the ground in a wet heat I very courageously crawled to Pluto I'm not in base contact with the guy that's grappling him but I'm close by okay and I'm just going like moral support yeah I I get closer and I'm like I'm here man you're gonna be okay as it's like ripping into you it's hugging me you know it's your turn I I frantically start swinging my sword at him and disadvantage yep this might grab do anything to him it keeps him from moving okay I got a 16 that hits for 15 damage leaving him bloodied so as you grab him and you and he grabs you you manage to take your sword out and stab it downward ripping it across his back and I'm gonna try to trip him okay trip trip trip chipper he fails and is pushed to the ground and you managed like he's still grabbing you he's on the ground and you aren't pulled down with him okay and then I'm gonna try to stab him in the limbs one of the limbs enjoy yourself disadvantage yes so but that but because he's prone that cancels out okay so I got a 21 to hit yep 411 damage the second blow knocking him to the ground you drive your blade into what passes for this creatures chest and it stops moving in its grip loosens yeah and and then I owe you got something in your eye I don't know if you knew that it just your eyes look really red and poison a new look I'm trying okay these creatures the the first one continues to rush towards veo can it get as it fails 200 yeah it is very it's because the Aten is destroyed so yeah it is vaster haha thank you for catching me Chiti Chiti p.m. yeah I am NOT a baby bird that is not my food preference and I 4:12 that is a hit yeah well how these guys are easy to hit because there's been some low rolls but they're getting by 20 damage nice oh no critical the shot leaves it bloodied but it continues to shamble forward and I use my bonus action to - I run towards one over ya Pluto and they are over here 60 feet oh okay she does three laps of us you you're running circles it circles around us you taking advantage of their elevating position these creatures continue to to bombard you with their projection was firing two against Sebastian and the other firing two against veo ready to serve more than one the one that they all got is still alive he can he can vomit that fire he moves oh okay that makes more sense I was like wow that's a skill ya know they they've uh they've got a range of 30 feet yep I had the flu once and uh I think I know what they're talking about the 30 I mean I had the flu more than once but I had a flu bad enough once so Sebastian against you I get two hits no crits though what are the hits 21 and 18 yeah it's a total of eight damage poison damage and I'll need a constitution saving throat from you and against veo he's on the ground so he doesn't have advantage but veo I get 17 and 21 both it and there that'll be six poison damage for you and a constitution saving yeah I got 12 you succeed okay nine I think I'm just gonna let go you fail fail you're poisoned okay remove my web okay we go to the top of the round with Sebastian I'm going to move away I'm a little sick of getting a suit on so I kind of run past everybody Howard some more rubble okay and I'm going to fire a fire bolt at the injured guy over here nice now that's a crit twenty-two more damage it blasts him apart yet does boom that was a warning shot it wasn't there wasn't guys it wasn't a warning shot at all that was for joke Pluto I'm gonna start hucking hand axes at acid Mick jerkface okay do it to it you know his name yep I read it in a manual 15 hits four I only add my strength 11 damage and almost a crit and then another 11 so you Huck the two axes up and they go sailing up one lands on the one head that it has one lands on the other and it drops and falls forward to the ground I retrieve my axis the dust settles and the streets are quiet once again we're gonna hit to our break see in a few minutes we are

slaughtered these misshapen victims of the falling star that came 15 years ago what fate these people suffered you can know that the pain that they have been in is over so we did a good thing are they are they obvious followers of the Fallen no they they were the outcome of the literal oh okay I thought they were like wearing garbage I have things in their chests yeah yeah the the look of anguish on their faces is palpable and looking at their forums now you can see how emaciated or distended or bloated in awkward ways they have become truly monstrous results of that eldritch Eve there are two things that I've realized number one I I'm disgusting I'm covered in bile and blood it's most of it my own some of it not the second thing is not only am i disgusting but I haven't washed these clothes in months why do you think people call me smelly there's no place to wash in Drakon Heim yeah you just kind of roll with it I have taken a lot of liberties doing I want to go in that water do we ever like a decent water source at the Clocktower like can I can I rinse out these clothes can I at least bandage up these wounds and I would really like to clean my face off there's nothing anywhere suffering from poison so I definitely need to take someone the only thing you could count on at the clock tower would be rain water would be would be yeah would be collecting rainwater on days when the rain is normal I might build a contraption at the clock tower to collect rainwater so that I can wash my clothes I would confidently say that veo has almost certainly done that already thank you bail yeah yeah I I don't it was the pie I don't think you would have survived this long in the city if you didn't oh no yeah when we get back there I'm having a bath yeah hold on you're just gonna throw around bad like we don't this is a luxury yes get in here I'm Marty in it buddy and straight up buy it by and large like collecting rainwater in all old rackin Heim was the city that had functioning aqueducts in its heyday a lot of water collection would still have been supplemented by a rainwater collection so that's something that all of you would know as the thing that you do to get water yeah drinking water well ya know you divvy it up like okay maybe you're okay with being as smelly as you are but like you can go for a swim I can't I would ask you to clean me but I don't I don't think our friendship but like even the one place that you wouldn't get drinking or bathing water from would be the drain river and because it even in when Drakon hime was a city you just didn't do that because that water is nasty know where you push your enemies into I think of back home I have a place where the boats come and go and you just don't swim yeah yeah area yeah I'm a little bit poison right now so I'm gonna take some this ointment that we had from blackjack Mel probably still doesn't smell the best but no you're no longer poisoning you regain 18 hit points I think there's one dose of that left what's the greater healing potion give the greater healing potion is 20 hit points I'm gonna drink one of those okay I don't have any potions I think you have one dose left of the the ointment 1 min left is there is there a way that we can like stop for an hour maybe I mean like the the potion helped but I could I could use like some bandages and like tending to my wounds and how's everybody else doing you guys Journal I mean I'm pretty okay if you need to we can but I I mean I'm tough I can I can all protect you I'm just read about the haze do you promise I promise if you want to take a short rest taking one along the edge of the water on the docks would probably be the safest place to do so but there's still a risk I say we avoid it only because I just drank that potion yes now I'm being greedy okay that's fair I'm fine I'll I promise that if you die wait what oh yeah I mean I promise you will never die never ever all right wrestle actually I have a potion of healing I have one I have one potion of healing do you want a regular potion I'll take it okay shaggy round and back potions do those count for for the the magic if you drink too just healing potions to healing potions no if you combine a healing potion with a potion of anything else that's when we're gonna get wild actually maybe before we go any further since we're not taking a rest maybe I'm gonna drink delirium potion yeah so you are going to combine two potions no don't count but if I mix them with a delirium potion then they have the link counts as one when it's more than healing yeah only if you combine healing potions it doesn't kill ya healing potions and healing potions is fine healing potions and delirium potions I think it's so what's like what's like the recommended like on the bottle does it say like wait one hour before taking another potion it says on the bottle not recommended for use by any one student you're not consumed one minute oh yeah yeah I'll just take it in a minute okay okay you're gonna take the delirium potion yeah already uh Rolla Defour three so you gained four levels worth of spells perfect cool and does his eyes glow or anything weird oh yeah when you not uncork and knock back one of these delirium potions you can see the magic run through his veins almost the moment it pours down the throat like you can see the glow of the potions as it goes down his throat and then as it comes into his body you see the octarine energy rissalah pulsing through his blood veins and they kind of like burst a bulge forward out and you can see the streaks in his face in his eyes as his eyes then turn purple and glow for the the duration of the effect our overwhelming but it is not enough to cause a wild magic take my claw and I poke his face I'm like are you gonna lose your girl what are you doing no I'm just you know I'm I'm acting out the other superpower that I feel like yeah no not this time I got control of the situation if if you die from drinking potions that doesn't count a prayer pinky promise like you can't just drink you I think he promised me it's not your job to stop me from drinking too many potions I'm already gonna break this process I feel way better I feel powerful I feel healthy I'm ready to take on all of Dragon I'm by myself with you guys in the front lines know what that's a good attitude to have you know like when life comes out yeah it's like like making creme brulee you know I have no idea how to do it but when it comes out you just got to dive in face-first to it face-first in the creme brulee I always dive into my creme brulee face for what is creme brulee I don't know it's like is it like it's like look delicious I would have died face-first into it Pluto my my my dad makes a average creme brulee it I don't know I I think he tried once I don't remember if it was great we're all so confident but I'll get him to make you on okay next time we're a bad sure I've had it but I just can't picture it and now I can't yeah it's like life so moving on where will you go next going to the bridge Bridge yeah if there's one thing we're not scared of its bridges cuz you know what lives under bridges Charles you know what I kill drawls it's on my shirt so my shirt he got scared how many trolls have you killed at least one bridge sorry bridge is a unit of trolls yeah troll trolls are measured in bridges yeah there's usually one troll so frustrating heaven under yeah every time some way the measurement is one-to-one so why wouldn't you just say I've killed one troll why do we need a it's don't question the logic of troll Slayers look if you were a troll killer you patrol yeah you know the whole bridge worth of them yeah you know you know what's loot oh you're right I've killed one bridge worth of trolls a container where Charles good we we are equal in our troll killing I never knew sure called bridge question though do you have fire this time what why do I need fire oh yeah you sure it ends right now you guys can all roll me a d6 for five three okay after several hours of travel sneakily heading along the southward you have come to champions bridge it is a grand causeway which spans the dran river itself a bridge almost 500 feet long and across the width of it about 50 feet wide across the way it is a large causeway that reaches up almost like it gently arcs Oh over the bridge at the highest point the bridge is high enough that it can accommodate a reasonably large barge or a ship or a small boat that would head along the drowned river underneath the the central section of it but through the rest of it is an arched causeway that reaches across champion's bridge is so named for the grand statues which decorate the the arches of the city for Drakon Heim has been a city of many heroes great warriors and generals and the city has honored its heroes by erecting their statues upon champions bridge the bridge has sustained moderate damage and several of the large statues the the largest statues themselves are built along the side of the bridge almost holding up the bridge in a guardian like pose named for the great founders and various dynasties and families that founded Drakon Heim for the Vaughan castles were not the first family to rule Drakon hymen were indeed or a user where user purrs over the previous ones but the statues of those old families still hold up over champions bridge although the damage from the crater has defaced many of them and then along the way of the bridge are smaller shrines on little balconies that jut out to other heroes that have been left over the ages and and time dozens of small shrines have been erected here many of which are statues and shrines to people who later became saints of this the sacred fire people who would later be kings and Generals rulers princesses and more of the city yes we're gonna end up here one day on this bridge who's gonna build who's gonna build the statues though yes oh yeah I have to do it all by no I actually that's a really nice thought because this this is actually a bridge that I have seen many many times it's one of the few parts of drunken home that I've seen many many times because well as you know amberwood village is just down the way there yeah and when my dad would bring stock of his gear up to Dragon hime we would cross the champion's bridge to bring it to the market so I used to I used to actually stop on this bridge as a kid a lot and just imagine what it would be like you know if I was a hero and if I had a statue on this bridge and I would just always imagined myself so you don't need to join some cult or the following fire in order to be a hero but you need is your face on this bridge and that really says it draw your face I'm going to your face here oh wait are we are we just like we're not on the bridge yet we're just like at the edge of it or how we started walking onto the bridge you are at champions we're champions Way meets the bridge I'm gonna put my face on this bridge me too okay I think my dagger and I start to try to scrape like a really crude like cat-like around do the Simba from Lion King as she's struggling to do that I come up next to her and I cast mold earth and I mold a perfect Sebastian face onto the bridge okay as you come up you can see that you're not the first to deface the bridge in this way no there are many others that have left their their mark and face I preface the bridge we fix the bridge there are many others that have left their marks on the bridge and it is reminiscent now in many ways of the old Eckerman mill a marking point of and you can see some people have left them mark saying you know our Gert like and dated it some of them which are a few years ago some of which are recently saying our group got this far like we we made it I I'm I'm Old Earth again to make a Pluto in Aveo and I write dragonforce underneath it and I put the date cool I'm still whittling I'm like look my better I want to look for is Jupiter Jones on the bridge the bridge is 500 feet long and it curves gently so you're just in a small lake you're just kind of look at the names as wide you wanna see if I can recognize any shares sure there are many bits of graffiti although respectfully most people have left the graffiti from where the actual shrines are along the way the top of the bridge is you go to cross it is an absolute mess there is a large array of abandoned carts of various sizes and shapes and a very clear as you come to the front of the bridge you can see burned into the bridge are the outlines and the skeletal remains of what must be hundreds of people not unlike the damage that has been done elsewhere in this part of the city it seems like in the in Drakon times last moments many people tried to flee across champions bridge and these are the people that were just a few moments too late you know what I don't like about bridges there a third excellent choke point I was also thinking last time we encountered statues that came alive and attacked us is that a common thing in Drakon home so far 100 percent of statues have attacked only on the walls this is a bridge it might be different you're gonna have to fight all the champions we would win what we can force against 500 feet of champion stone chain I'm just thinking like this is this is stuff that we got to think about as we approach this week just wander across the bridge there could be other we could well we could walk across we could prepare for the the jump someone's got the jump on us yep there could be monsters there there could be statues there there could be nothing so be on super alert yeah and we just described below that's crumbly this these for her Stacy face-first into creme brulee remember leh it's so fancy to like I would have done like a macaroni salad but that's pretty fancy well yeah I can't make that [Laughter] Pluto yeah I'm going first come first okay yeah he's big and strong and if you take all the hits you if you hide there if you're sneaky you could probably get the drop on someone there's not many places to hide on him I could like crawl across this reside there are there are several bits of debris and rubble and ruined and overturned trade carts and waggons across the length of it so there there is a fair amount of debris and rubble covering the whole top of the bridge okay guys we do this military sound from point to point Pluto have you walk straight ahead hop behind yeah and I'll just casually walk right up the middle of the bridge I'm Ian Vale will be ha are flanking besides yeah one of us along the left one of us along the right from hiding place to hiding place yeah okay now my bow at the ready the bridge gently slopes upward as you cross towards the centre of the Drowned river you can see rising above the haze the clock tower the cathedral tower and castle Drakon as you walk close champions bridge was a pretty awesome spot to get a look at the whole city on in its in its day and as you cross this ancient bridge and come to the center point of it as the the arch of the bridge arches downward you can see veil you and Sebastian ruling with stealth but pollute o is not correct okay but I'm super aware of everything that's happening yeah Pluto as you come to the center of the bridge you can see down the other side of it and it's just before you come to the center of it you can see that there is a tall figure on the the back on the opposite side of the bridge several tall figures seem to be wearing a great horned helmet some kind I do one of the dragon hime hold that means he's turning we have never practiced any of our hand signals so it's just one direction you can't you can't turn I yeah well maybe you stop oh well we already said I stopped I mean he stopped so we stopped I lower my head in frustration I feel and what can I see about these tall hooded are they hurted I made that up I made up the hooded are they wearing hoods there's fur oh they're wearing like a fur hood that has horns getting out of it how that's not a bird is it that's oh no it's not as it turns and looks to the side placing its hands on the the right of the side stone railing of the of the bridge looking out along the sides of the bridge it's a Minotaur can we get past them without them noticing us how far away are they yeah 200 feet away this meant this one doesn't hasn't seen you quite yet it's it's tall and so you saw its head as you crested the curve of the arch of the bridge basically little get back here yes sir I'm gonna I'm gonna reverse so I'm gonna slink back probably about 20 feet and then go to I'm gonna go over to veo okay I have an idea there's um there's a Minotaur for the first time ever we have the drop on them I say for the first time ever I say that you just fire at them and me and Pluto what if we use sort of a minor illusion to make a person lure them on the bridge and get them to go back you can't make a creature with minor Lucian I can only make an object but we have to lure them here they're on the bridge yeah like past us on the bridge what if we hide and try to get them to like go past us Bassem how many did I see I think I mean run this to theirs anymore this has been like the eighth time that we try to sneak past something and then we lose our advantage oh my gosh I'm really loud this time this time I'm saying we have the drop on them I say we attack them now before we lose this opportunity for once in our life I mean I can't hit them from here shoot first ask questions later yep all right you can you can hit them from here I've seen you do things like Bayeux creme brulee creme brulee creme brulee his face one last point is there any way that a Minotaur is going to be our friend oh I didn't even think about that let's just assume no shoot it you're the monster hunter yes they are really into crosswords and Sudokus puzzles just generally puzzles they're huge and puzzles and we're all right so if anything he's just gonna trick us and we all know that if somebody doesn't like the same things as you shoot yeah especially in Dragon hime that's our mo right that's that's what I've taken away from this whole experience yep okay all right okay wait Pluto me else we get into an ambush position because this is not helpful because I need this hand I also need this hand okay okay good huh be close all right so we try to get into an advantageous position I'm gonna wait for it because if if there shoots it we can just wait for them to come down that's that's the idea we Louie weak she starts landing shots on them I can start flinging spells when they get close you clean up the garbage okay I'm the janitor of the bridge bridge janitor caretaker bridge I custodian of champions bridge custodian of Champions the custodian of gym maybe you're the champion of custodians better we'll find the time so what are you gonna do so me employer are gonna get into an ambush position and veil and like a cart is gonna take a shot at the man I want to be behind it cart okay so pollute oh and Sebastian you too can make stealth checks as you go towards the cart go Kibeho we're staying like it's still 200 feet back from them though yes but you're you're still trying to dart from one car to another so you're darting in and out of cover so all of you and a oh do you still is passed us out Trey still in effect no Wow 19 you guys are old with this advantage due to exhaustion correct yeah oh I'm just normally disadvantaged well what you got 8 6 ok I stopped my toe so you clamour forward and as you do you stumble into one of the carts and it gets sent rolling forward with a lot a lot loud rumble and then it screeches and crashes into another one and then and the you are approximately a hundred feet away from the Minotaur's when this happens and you need to roll for initiative member my plan for once for once I thought we could get the drop on an enemy if it's any consolation if we tried to sneak by I also would have failed well I think if they passed us and we just dash away remember remember that we got caught with that was intersex every time we tried this plan of sneaking past something it fails and now apparently even when we're 200 feet away and we try to hide behind a cart we throw the card into another time we're 100 hour a hundred feet away it's a body are we still behind something or no oh sweet I guess we could now open up diplomacy now that we failed our yet you and before you is a statue of Carol even deign a famous Ranger General of Drakon Haim who helped to urge a den of lycanthropes that dwelt in drackett Haim and apparently had a rather famous magical longbow which still might be in the city somewhere ooh fancy Carol remember Carol I remember yes okay I know I'm reading the same passage thank you everything the same what did you all get pretty good eighteen thirteen fourteen eighteen fourteen thirteen I was 13 yeah yep okay something's getting stabbed it's gonna be me so to prevent that there are three minotaurs to barring great axes and another wears a cloak and is carrying a ballista ah this is the classic so do we try to plumb see put down your ballista that's my ask okay they oh you were the first act the Minotaur's whinny and grunt and begin pulling back their hooves to charge forward so they saw us like we're gonna they didn't just see the crash they saw us as well okay yeah yeah minotaurs have like a real good great wonderful cast my zephyr strike action to get my advantage [Laughter] and I'm gonna take my shots at the middle Minotaur okay the ranged one the shot goes completely wide I take my second fourteen the last shot hits the Minotaur and there's a king in the air as it bounces off of its chainmail Oh Bert and then I move on the back part of the cart on - I see a little kind of outpost and I want to go all the way to the outpost actually you know what about that far before climbing up I'm like well I'm actually just gonna duck by and look down about about 50 feet into the water below and I make it make a decision to come back yeah second-guess that yep okay minotaurs the Minotaur width of ballista takes out a very strange-looking bolt Oh loads it into his weapon and fires it forward towards Sebastian Cluedo you said that you would oh god it's firing at me Pluto get in front of me I can start he gets a 16-2 hit do I have any sort of bonus cuz I'm behind the cart what's your a scene are naturally twelve twelve you would have plus two for her three quarters cover I'm also gonna cash shield okay this is a cash shield and as the bolt comes towards you it opens up into a net ah that flies over Sebastian and Pluto well you're able to deflect the damage of the bolt with your shield both of you need to make dexterity saving throws excuse you 8:19 i duck behind the car sebastian you launch the shield deflecting the bolt and then the net basically goes completely having totally ensnare Spoleto wrapping around him and although the heavy bolts of it pin him to the to the ground boludo you were a restrained sebastian you've avoided the the shot the other two minotaurs run forward and as they rushed forward they each throw they they lower their axes and throw a smaller hand axe one at sebastian and one at Pluto Pluto you get crit and Sebastian I get a natural one nice now I'm still dunking big a disadvantage because I'm behind a cart in a net they cancel each other out and also I can't take crits right but you can still hit me I still hit you for 14 / now as they Thunder forward the you seen the Minotaur is up close they're massive creatures bursting with muscle and bovine strength and they one of them is a dark brown in fur color the other is jet black the other at the back with a with the ballista is modeled in color the one with the ballista appears to be wearing armor but the other two up here to just have a thick bovine hide loot oh you're up I want to get out of the net okay I want to try to do that make a strength check oh it's so big 8 you can add your exponents that's only gonna be 11 Oy you're sorry you're still caught in the net ah I panic okay I spend the rest of my turn panicking okay Sebastian you're up I'm kneeling behind the cart and you're just flailing around in this net and I kind of like leaned over and I'm like you know I have an idea but it's gonna be really uncomfortable ah okay I put my hand on Pluto and I like I start to concentrate as hard as I can and my eyes just turn pure black and shadowy tendrils come out of my hand and start wrapping around you and you turn into a giant ape the netting bursts at the scenes as Pluto becomes a giant ape this shadowy horrific eight with like octarine drooling from its lips Pluto you feel your mind doll but only slightly I'm actually way better at cube puzzles Sebastian you're Shetty in front of this eighth is that where you want to be I actually so before I finish so I turn him into a giant ape all of this shadowy energy wraps around him creating that and then I turn around and I point at the guy the Minotaur with the ballista and I just mumble get him and with my bonus action I'm gonna use three sorcery points and my hound leaps out from a shadowy dimension can your how far can your Hound be conjured um so let's see how the bill Allman can be conjured target one creature you can see within a hundred and twenty feet of good yep sweeps out Reaper appears is Reaper leaps Adam and I'm going to so I I do that in I back away just Reaper get an attack on this journey yes and though you're on deck or do I am I talking Reaper yeah seventeen that hits five damage okay strength saving throw ever be knocked prone he gets a 12 it's a 13 so Reaper comes out and knocks this minute or two the ground third and I run and hide okay hide behind me I'm behind you okay now you're up what a disadvantage if I fire at the knock prone yes because he's prone I poke my head out beside the car between the giant Apes legs and I fire at the Minotaur on your right okay [Music] 17 that's a hit 21 damage ouch and take my second shot 18 hit hits 19 damage and then I slinked back behind the cart okay next up are the Minotaur's this minutes were clamors to his feet or the yep yep listen seeing Reaper in front of him he takes his hole he pulls back with it with his horns and tries to pitch Reaper hey getting a critical hit against Reaper no Reaper takes 30 points of piercing damage 30 yeah as the horrific Minotaur barrel get as he throws himself to his feet and just Pierce's his horns into Reaper and the Hound howls he really is reaper still alive reaper is still alive okay he's not looking too great though cool the minitor as well is going to step forward around a round Reaper and then he's going to crouch down prone he's not out of the range though no I'm staying in range every breed he kind of chuff's him aside leaps forward and drops to the ground the other two minotaurs the first one rushes forward towards pollute Oh Jackson charging him taking the bull by the horns here he recklessly attacks with advantage getting a critical hits Oh Mitch because you're polymorph the crit applies I'm Johnny Johnny man as he rushes forward oh my gosh oh my gosh you're gonna be okay we're 40 damage on a charge attack and you need to make a DC 14 strength saving throw I got like a 25 okay so you're not knocked prone as he crashes into you the other Minotaur charges forward into the carts hey crashing into the cart and pushing the cart backwards on top of a oh so veo you can make a strength saving throw it's coming too fast eight the cart pushes forward and topples over and rams into you and you take 18 points of bludgeoning damage and the cart is partially it's like almost totaled by the attack it's not destroyed but it's it's heavily damaged is it still cover it is still cover just not total cover anymore yeah cool Pluto you're up next seeing this Minotaur gouging me I go very primal and I start to beat my chest and then I just start slamming it in the head with my giant ape fists and I let out like a like a roar rawr that's it you did it I did 17:17 to hit your Crashdown with your fists it hits it's 17 damage nice and I'm gonna keep smashing it you actually have advantage on your attacks because he's attacking recklessly okay no crit and uh like a 20 for both it and then who come on there we go 31 damage oh my god what a nine and nine and a seven that leaves it bloody oh I just start doing that ape yeah that was it blonde its head okay and that's my that's my turn Sebastian you're up Marius Reaper is still gonna he's gonna leap at the back of this guy again Kate attacking with advantage because he's laying prone 19 that hits yeah 11 more damage nice I generally be using Reaper to cast a spell but I all my spells that would affect on our concentration so I am going to I run out and I jump onto this cart and I'm actually going to like jump in between these two minotaurs and then thunder step yeah they both crit they're saving throws yeah so good crit Wow okay thank you Scout splitter day that was you did like a cannonball though it's still really yeah it's still really cool uh the cart doesn't make it saving throw the cart did hurt you though yeah I'm gonna use my last point to empower this spell just it because that was a not the best role and I want to get as much damage there a little better let's that's 20 damage so they take half so time they are both bloodied nice array and the cart is yeah the carts totaled by it it's Thunder damage so just breaks into splinters where are you gonna teleport to that's a great question [Laughter] teleport back so I just run out I run up the cart can literally cannonball and in the midair between them there's an explosion and then I appear next to veil rushing myself off that's my turn nice all right to the top with Vail all right the card is only half I'm not gonna move from where I am and I'm just I'm gonna take my first shot against the Minotaur across from Pluto using Zephyr strike as my bonus action cuz I want to get that advantage 12 the shot hits but it does not look like it went through his packs just deflect it with his Minotaur Peck okay I take my second shot against the same one oh wow here we go 22 that is a hit solid you're right beside him so I get my sneak attack yeah are you bass or no yeah yeah yeah he gouged me so he's actually inside me a little bit no that is axes his horn yeah horn you're like oh three ones no - one - the - yeah sad damage 20 damage damn it really damage 22 well I mean it's enough that he still has one hit point so it's kind of relevant um and then I just hop up on to the ledge not the far ledge but at least the first one because I don't trust that other guy down there oh but I don't fall oh now I'm the one next or behind the cart Oh crouching on the knob I'm looking pushed up against the cart because I think that's a good idea the the Minotaur over here gets up and attacks Reaper yep the dog getting a 17-2 hit that'll do it impales reaper for 14 points of damage and reaper goes flying back into a portal to Hell and disappears and the Minotaur clamors forward and takes cover behind the pile of rubble and drops prone behind it the same rebel I know the bigger pile that he could actually hide his Minotaur like form because he's a big guy so he's prone behind the cover and he starts to reload his ballista the other two minotaurs the wounded Minotaur does his nerve shake I can't tell no it doesn't he's angry and he barrels he barrels into pollute Oh with his great axe attacking recklessly getting in come on skulls fighters when did you send him what did what does science done wasn't dice wasn't a giant Eve I would perfectly valid result I should be perfectly balanced day yep so that's uh that's that's 2525 slashing damage as a house enrage slashes into the the giant ate the other Minotaur clamors over the ruins of the cart and leaps down bringing his axe down on Sebastian no Sebastian getting a 18 to hit oh yeah that's gonna do it not even shield bears down with the axe for 25 points of damage and I I need a concentration yeah what's what's my DC on that constant it's five no it's not 25 it's half the damage down so it's 13 okay well I got 10 that's a fail polymorph goes down oh it's ok so I start to like kind of like shriveled again big chunk you see me just get smashed with an axe and I like whimper and you just dissolve into Pluto yep the shadowy form just like flitters away like dust and I shouldn't watch that movie again ok we go now to pollute oh I'm a man yep and I'm on a mission so be head this minute are you have advantage on your attacker all because he was attacking recklessly and I'm gonna need it oh yeah 22 that is a hit and 4:11 damage he only had one hit point left it's all we need it is gone to glory what are you doing and then I'm going to turn how does it go down okay so he I picture his his horns are in me and then I and I shrivel up well the last attack was an active in --is-- slashing you and and as the other one leaps over the cart and brings the axe down on Sebastian you shrivel back down into human form and the Minotaur is very shocked by this and so I think the axe kind of falls out of me when I yeah smaller and I take that opportunity to just kind of dismember him so I just I removed both of hit both of his arms in one slash any drop in some ways an armless in a minute armless good luck with your puzzles now I mock him mazes puzzles right it's like that's the thing it's the thing I'm going with and then I turn and I stare at the other one and I then I still have your movement in your second eye and I run out okay oh yeah oh yeah and I'm bringing the NA and I jump off the cart and I would did he attack recklessly yeah yeah Oh baby and I get a 16 that hits whoo four three four ten damage okay and I'm gonna do another four damage and he has to make a strength saving throw he gets a sixteen that's my stuff yeah so he ties does that mean he gets it he got he saves yep then I'm going to action surge and just keep driving man driving at home uh yeah like a 22 for 13 damage and then make another save he gets a 22 what and then he takes another one damage and then get hit him again for have to do that it's like a 24 10 damage Pluto you've just slain two minotaurs in the single round what so you cut so you unpolymerized stroke disarmed the first minute or who's still like standing there in shock as he bleeds to death as you leap over to the other one and just with three quick slashes it's because you're above him so I land one two three three strokes to cut its head off oh so I just yeah just keep going at it and then I kick over his body and I go I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you it's okay but I'm here now if I spray you oh man I need a new shirt yeah also it's yeah it's covered in black Sebastian it's your turn all right I do it I I get hoisted up by Pluto onto the cart elegantly and I'm going to scorching ray this last guy you do so with disadvantage because he's prone f-fine 19 okay that hits all right I'm gonna I mean firing all three of them okay - oh wait fifteen that hits as well Oh baby one more 12 not hit all right so deflected sixteen damaged nice bolt of flame erupted as from the area as you fire them your finger guns at him and then I jump back down next to Pluto okay and I'm like there I think I got him he's probably dead did you see no okay yeah you're up just assuming that I did something to perching from the little part of the bridge I gotta take my bow out and I fire is he also still down yeah why is he hiding you know something uh 18 that hits battle tactics get Vale 20 damage bloodied my second hit deflected off the off the cover alright I stay perched up where I am okay the Minotaur reaches steps up from the cover and fires a Bastila shot a ballista shot at bay Oh getting a stand ahead the shot goes completely wide from seeing this pusses and hand on the railing of the bridge and leaps off the bridge what okay bye and there's a splash in the water below now if you want to swim in there I like I run and I wait for him to surface you run over make a perception Jackie I'm still exhausted are ya guys so yeah that's a 19 as you run up to the bridge you you see him swimming underneath the bridge they'll get to the other side of the bridge I feel I know Jilla tee over to the other side of the bridge okay I'm going to be waiting with a hand axe yeah it's ready firm - okay how long do you wait at it's how wide is the bridge like and and the the the the part that you can walk down is 40 feet wide but then the the extra railing makes it like almost 50 to 60 people ten minutes yeah I can make a guesstimate on how long it would take to swim forty feet after after a few minutes I think I'm like guys what if he just like went under the bridge and then went either of the directions of the bridge or he drowned there's that then in that case we win but I don't feel like I got you killed - minotaurs in like six seconds I'm gonna kill another one let's let's climb down No first first of all climbing second of all look at that water have you been in that water I've been in that water okay all right you've been in that water I think there's something under we avoid the water there's something under the I mean if only we had somebody who was really good at climbing who could like scurry down there and just check it out actively avoid the water if only we will either Noble and worthy continue and well who will you did if you don't if you don't fall in the water you are avoiding it so technically he raises a point you're gonna want to not be in the water so it's probably advantageous to climb stay quiet I start to walk down the bridge Tower we go wait up yes we won hope you guys are coming to the tower I mosey along I'm gonna throw the the corpses over the side okay really wait get their horns first yeah well check that yeah I'm gonna take their horns as a switching minotaurs they're endangered species what lands will give us some gold for them yeah they're endangered evil species them in your bag holding do they have anything on them yeah other than make their armor in there I forgot that I have yeah on one of them one of them has a a potion of healing on him and the other in a small satchel in a small small satchel it looks like he has several alchemical and material components for a couple spells like he had looted it and in and amongst all the rest of it are are some pieces of delirium there are several fragments of delirium each or probably get worth at least a hundred gold pieces of piece and there's three of them inside yeah yeah bears got a tracker on it you said that the boat licked the component bag that looked like it was like stolen or it's like his who knows okay I thought it was like a I'll take the components I mean I'll add them to my pile of garbage that I used to cast spells and emergencies I know one takes your garbage want to look around the rest of the bridge because there's carts and everything I want to look at the statues to see if there's anything of value around them that people may have left hmm anything like that it's my statue any Sorcerer's any any members of the amethyst Academy Ranger look at the Rangers but notably there are no people here that could that are members of the our or referred to as members of the amethyst Academy it's actually quite notable because are there like members from like the hooded lanterns there are members of what would have been the predecessors of the hooded lanterns because a city guard because the city the hooded lanterns take their name from the city watch but the actual City Guard and the army of VESA Marr would have had their commanders marked along here yes any other notable names as we to her along yeah we would take time to like check out the statues yeah have a scenic route now that there are no minotaurs yeah there won't kill them in we won't chase the minotaurs yeah doing like I say another statue that you pass is a flame flame keeper faith barley keeper who was the founder of the order of the unicorn a and known as a famous order of vampire hunters within the the order of the unicorn being an order of vampire hunters that were founded by the church and she being one of the most famous vampire killers of the age so even before dragon had all of these monsters and issues we apparently had werewolves and vampires to deal with huge vampire and werewolf problem yeah yeah we've just replaced some monsters with different monsters maybe were the monsters Shh when I took the statue of that lame lantern that would pass by yeah see there's anything notable around her just just the inscription of of what of what he achieved and and what what they did as ranger general of the city and this actually very lead that demonstrates the the bow that they used to own but it's a stone bow it is indeed salvaging that bow salvaging around the bridge it depends on how much time you want to search through it but there probably is a fair amount of things that you could Salvage around here if you wanted to go through and stretch through it yeah we can do that we could do the whole hour into a short rest well can we spend a short rest salvaging no okay I think we could take an hour to cross the rest of the bridge rummaging through I mean you're less than an hour away from the tower as well true what I mean like oh no peace and other carts and stuff as we're going as you do so you managed to find there's lots of tools and ruined foodstuffs and various sets of trade goods several weapons that are in good condition ammunition nothing that's of better quality than your current equipment but you do find a a old merchants cart that hasn't been overturned yet and inside is a small chest that is clinging with the sound of coin I'm age hand to open it suspicious there's several gold bars and coins inside it probably about 500 gold pieces I'm a Chan close it and drop it into my bag of holding just gonna add 500 I get to you guys figure out the rest it was pretty easy I don't know why yeah okay yeah if there's any small supplies that you're looking for you could probably salvage something from the ruins amongst here no I'm looking for a magical bow oh nothing of that nature yeah a lot of it has been picked over but you got one lucky find one day I will find this bow it will be mine what was the name of the Ranger Carol even Dane and the bow was called a whisper we'll keep eyes open I was just looking at tools I've been keeping an eye open throughout my time here because I know it's been a prize that people have been seeking but no luck so far no I'm still guys there's still like a like I'm like a Minotaur den under this bridge you think it's under the bridge like the whole den nike probably so what happened to the trolls you said that you there was trolls under the bridge well there could be trolls now there's just minotaurs well yeah that's the thing about containers like bridges they can have so we've officially killed one bridge of minotaurs so three minotaurs equals one troll you're getting it yeah you're getting it well we didn't actually kill three we killed two I killed two one got away and I don't like that I don't like that one got away how did it feel being a giant shadowy I really wanted to fling my feces and it took everything in my like I had this gut reaction yeah you know when I changed him to one two same thing just your primal thing in there it was like you could use poop as a weapon and I'm like no man no it's not a bad battle tactic it's just you know I don't usually have those thoughts and then I turn into a giant ape and suddenly there they are yeah it's just it's like you know comes with the territory we've now both been a giant ape that's one thing we haven't called that saved me don't turn I would I would have died if I got crit twice by dars so what you're saying is Sebastian crow saved your life yeah can I record here's my here's my business card all right let's make our way to the tower and finally get some breasts and about No yes water for drinking I will separate some drinking water you can use mud guys I'm having about it no you don't get to bet you arrive back at the clock tower coming back from champions bridge and surveying the familiar devastation of the market square there it is before you is the Grand astrological clock of Drakon hime the multi-faceted face of the clock depicting all the plains and all their connections in addition to the date and time the clock still locked in that ominous position between pandemonium and limbo it was stuck in almost a hundred and eleven years ago did you come up the steps of the clock tower and push open the heavy doors you can hear the chattering of rat poke as they they will laugh and squeal and there's there's a you the sound of a bow being knocked and then you hear a boy saying no no no don't shoot don't shoot is ghosties course is good yes yes yes they friend not pray we not shoot them they okay petunia so soothing to hear his voice I feel so comfortable yes we very very Savior thank you thank you thank you yes yes this good tower I promise you we not eat little birds we find other things to eat okay very very good

cloaks i wearing one now [Music] can you show us where the bodies are oh no no no we have them over Oh over here some over there some over there this one still have bits left on it okay guys we can't send anybody else to the clock tower we have a great defense remember we have a great defense at our Tower now don't send anybody here Oh Mike says that they hooded lanterns we know who's the green deny deny deny we didn't we didn't see any nobody great job good good job defense reward eating people very very yes that can be your reward you eat anybody that comes to this tower unless they have a note from us what is note all that easy I cannot read yes yes so if you see a paw print on a piece of paper it means not to eat them how I know they not kill you chop your hand off use your hand to make because you are the only one who knows about this property he's on to something maybe we just don't send anyone if they try to trick me but this is what they try to make foolish fool of me okay just kill anybody that comes here other than that they avoid the first floor you're only on the first floor right we said oh no no no we like all the Heights yes yes many many nice Raptor rafters for the little ones to climb around but you didn't go you didn't mess with them Oh John's that was instructions you didn't mess with the robots upstairs I gave you those instructions I did not but but but scree scree go out there try to touch shiny and then explode Oh No yeah avoid touching the but there are many click lock the ducts this very interesting place we like this yes yes that's great so
