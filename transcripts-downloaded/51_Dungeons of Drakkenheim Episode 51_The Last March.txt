we just we had a wonderful trip down in Philadelphia we were so thrilled to be able to get to meet so many of you that watched the show whether on YouTube or Drakon hi it was a real treat and absolutely getting to meet and talk to people that watch the show and are like you've helped me with our game and I got the ambient because of you or I'm a player it was really like overwhelming and touching and so thank you so much I learned that so many people really enjoy using animate objects on gold coins I heard that from so many people and I'm so thrilled that all of you love that idea and are ruining your dm's plans with it yes so a really huge thank you to those of us that those of you that you like came up and said hi to us during the con it was a real highlight of the whole thing for us probably hands-down getting to meet folks that was the best part of pax unplugged and it was a really awesome con so with that let's return to the ruins Drakken homers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed Wolf leave the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome to the ruins of Drakon Haim when last we left our heroes they had made a valiant foray into the depths of Castle drakon their defeating a monstrous of multi-eyed creature guarding the pillar which binds the body and soul of Johan Eisner the steward of Drakon Heim and vales adoptive father our heroes explored the deepest depths of the castle and returned once again alive this time with a difficult choice before them for it seems that there are several different solutions before them a monstrous creature rests on the throne of Castle drakon a malevolent will but only an appendage of an entity far beyond the mortal world severing this link alone will not end its threat and thus our heroes are left with a difficult decision do they imbue Johannes nur with the power of the seals of Drakken Heim so that he may contain its threat do they seek to place an heir on the throne imbued with the power of the seals of the small Council to wrestle with this malevolent will for God's know how long or do they head through the rift that is slowly opening between the worlds and take on the problem at its source potentially never returning themselves to this world having returned back to the camp outside Eckerman mill now a shanty town of Palisades tents and small fortifications were the forces of caspia and Westham are the hood of the both the hooded lanterns and many more remnants and assembled troops the far from several other noble houses have gathered and arrived or the past several days and the forces of the hooded lanterns and the Caspian ziz more of them have arrived in anticipation of the marching armies of Illyria reports have come in across the past few days of the approaching forces of the illyrian army as well that heads towards Drakon Heim intent on burning it to the ground led by the high paladin of the silver order himself at the order of the hierarchy and indeed the reports that you've had so far Alejo as Lord Commander indicate that even now as forces throughout west of our attempt to assemble to meet this threat others have defected to the illyrians believing that the believing the message and the missive of the hierarch that the royal family is lost and compromised so it seems that the illyrian that even the illyrian forces may swell beyond what their initial expectations are in the meantime the ruins continue to be a more hostile environment than ever before with the rattling x' praying openly on those who dare to walk the streets many of the patrols of the hood of lanterns have even given up on trying to explore the outer reaches of the city there are some inroads that are still possible it seems that some of the gates have not the both temple gate and Shepherds gate have been abandoned the gates hang open the rattling x' don't have much interest in fortifications instead preferring their underground burrows and while the streets are empty for the most part during the day during the night no one Ward her some mess as oops Sebastian has spent days in insanity conferring with this spirit of his mother in the worlds beyond these reports have come in to you Vale pollute Oh increasing agitation from the Caspian talk from Saul Jackson of saying why don't we just act we should just get in there charged forth take the castle what's left that's not that easy dad I give him like a okay boomer sort of like the glance like it back of my day it's like dad you don't get it like this is different this is different magic we're dealing with okay there's a giant Minotaur that sleeps there's a like the the defenses of the castle are still totally active and there's no way at least after conferring with Lucretia and Eric and and you're in your mom and and Lenna like from the other worlds I have serious doubts whether or not he can hold the throne I do not wish to place a Caspian child in danger but I don't know if we have other options Saul Jackson is almost red faced having had this repeated conversation several times and Eldrick turns to him in the midst of the conversation and says George George is a strong lad he's bright talented but he's not prepared to match wills with whatever this creature is now as far as storming the castle with seals in hand and the forces that we'd have assembled that might be possible to launch an assault Lord Commander we could with a dedicated enough group of group of people and the support of myself and River and perhaps one or two other mages from the Academy we may be able to shield our group long enough to get inside the castle walls but at that point we'll be fighting for our lives every inch of the way we'll need a direction we'll need a destination we'll need somewhere that we can go to bring people and fortify that area if I were to come and River or to come we could potentially make some sort of in road or fortify some area until we can fight our way through the situation but we won't have long you're not just fighting against the creatures that are in there though you're fighting against the castle itself and I doubt for long we'd be able to last by fortifying an area we can't at the very least the single greatest threat to bringing all of us there is simple the haze and the effects of this sludge are unlike anything we've seen or studied before it will mean that we will not find rest there and the erratic magic that is in place around the castle if it's anything like the erratic magics that are in place around the academy tower it will mean that even magical transportation or teleportation or effects that we could use to quickly get in or out will be risky I wouldn't want anybody risking their lives more than we've already risked at this point I think it's up to us to figure out a way um I don't think so Jupiter Jones interjects and says we're all risking our lives if we don't do something soon little dammit illyrians will be here right on our doorstep and then we'll have to make a decision and if we hold any further longer we'll have even more rattling x' to cut our way through we don't have time to make a calculated choice now is the time for action and that's what gas pians are best at oddly enough for once I'm going to agree with Jupiter Jones I think thank you I'm usually right you're making me regret this already Jupiter yeah atta boy Jupiter okay I think Bastian we're gonna need all the help we can get in that castle and there could be more threats and if we're dealing with that thing on the throne which we're going to have to one way or another I am worried based on my initial glance at it but it might be beyond just the three of us we might need help and why would we say no when if we lose track and haim everybody here loses track in Haim and everybody who wants to fight should have the right to fight for this city Elias Drexel chimes in and says I've made a lot of mistakes in my time as Lord Commander things that I regret but I won't regret going into that castle I think then we need at least some people to stay behind to with the camp but whoever wants to volunteer you can't stop you if we can kill that thing on the throne we can cement or at least have a foothold in the castle giving us an opportunity to take back its power whether we put Erik on George on the throne or not it at least gives opens up the opportunity Sebastian's right it without killing that thing on the throne we don't get anywhere now there's still the question of the thing on the throne is an appendage well after we kill the thing on the throne we need to go through that portal and we need to kill whatever is on the other side if that's the hand we need to we can't just chop off the hand we need to kill the body now here's something I want to bring up Pluto I agree with you but right now time is of the essence we need to act fast and I think jumping into that portal without a proper understanding of what's going to happen to us is suicide and as much as I'm willing to risk my life for Drakon high and do what it takes I think if we're just a tad smarter about this cutting off the appendage we'll wound the creature allowing us to potentially close the rift I know that my mom told me to go down there and talk to orcas and sell my soul and I I've been thinking about that I'm gonna tell you it still sounds like a bad idea it's it's it's my mum's wish and I usually would just be like all a mom is know best like that's the thing I don't know if my mom knows best in this case she wanted me to have power and do great things and I think the greatest thing I can do is not just giving my life away to a devil that has her demon who has corrupted and controlled he's he's kind of responsible for rat rat and I'm how close are the the alarians more than days but less than a month like more than a week less than a month so we have illyrians surrounding us we have rats infesting the city yeah and we're gonna need to be here the three of us we happen to be here giant flesh monster living on the throne hear me out I think okay you think what yeah I think if we cut off the appendage close the gate it will give the amethyst Academy time to research the the gate yeah and maybe we can find a way that you you you said yourself that we would go you would come with me to find mouse I'll come with you to kill that thing once we can control maybe we can put someone on the throne to fight back the creature Matthias speaks finally she comments you can still put young George on this throne look if he takes the sacrament his will will be strengthened for behind his will with the will of the sacred fire you have known it is said that from the darkest shadow is born the newest light the greatest lights the only that shadows I did say that dwell in the worlds beyond our own and for untold ages the sacred fire has held them at bay but this this is what has been prophesized for in this rift we could spill forth into the darkness and bring a new light to worlds that have never seen it that New Age of Heroes could be upon us George with the power that we have of the flame in his heart could match the wills with the beasts and soothe even that terrible beast in time give the flame the opportunity to spark a new ember is George in the room and looking around he is not George George get in here saw applies at that and says can we can we really ask the boy to do that you want him on the throne I think yeah like I I mean as much as I'm worried about his health like at the end of the day if I thought he could take over a castle he should be able to decide whether or not he wants this responsibility it's up to him I can't make this choice for him Eldrick interjects I think that is ludicrous whatever Lucretia Mathias you are wise but you are also but some have called you mad whatever visions you have coming to you none can say truly for certain what power you might be giving that boy and you've been remiss to allow any of us a sample of your gold and delirium to discern its nature she gave me a sample I studied it for a few hours it's pretty crazy I remove Ignatius from its prince holder this is the power of of the golden delirium from what we've seen it is like the opposite of delirium and I'm wondering if not not delirium that needs to go into the heart but the opposite in order to tame this beast on the throne I'll jerk I know I know where you're coming from and George is young and putting him on the throne is dangerous but the three of us will be there to help and advise him once we kill the thing on the on the throne we can bring George in he has enough to come into danger really he could come in after once we've quelled the Beast as far as I'm concerned putting George on the throne could spell as much doom is putting the queen of thieves on the throne all right he didn't like my idea what if what if I went on the throne what if Pluto went on the throne ice was originally planned in place of George I could take well I could take the the flame I want to stick delirium in my heart Erik speaks up it says that might not be necessary yourself but should you the throne you would need to wear the stewards badge the only one who can act with the authority of the king is the steward but only to a limited extent that is the law of Drakon hime and it is engraved within the castles workings itself it is the same principle under which Eric under under which Johan is insisting on using the power himself he is a limited set of powers it only allows you to act as a custodian nothing more you would be able to do certain things but not them all because you're not a true heir that would be possible someone else could sit on the throne as the steward of dragon high they would essentially be taking yo.hannes place Lucrecia do you know of any way that we might be able to get Johan out his idea is to stay in there and the workings of the castle are beyond me these the castle was built by the mages of the academy not by with holy purpose you can turn delirium into gold but you can't remove a man from a pillar well then one person who can is the heir of Dragon and the workings of mortal magic are not so much my concern I am interested in much more lofty and more spiritual pursuits to me the rules of this throne seem arbitrary and unnecessary the city itself the notion of this mortal rulership of these kingdoms is not important next to all of us fulfilling our holy purpose before the sacred fire I I think that like so I think that owning the throne is actually less important sorry Caspian then the fact that we need somebody on that throne in order to get rid of the rats we need to kill that flush thing take control of the throne to stop the illyrian threat and to destroy the rattling is that that's my idea I agree that's even if we were to get somebody on the throne that's still a big piece the throne will not be safe until we can figure out how to get rid of the rats how to take the city back so sir who's gonna take the throne is really that like I know that we're going in there and I know that we're gonna kill whatever's on that throne via you currently have the stewards no I don't see Lord commanders who has the mysterious Eric Eric has ah yeah can we get Eric onto the throne we can be the best long as it's safe I wouldn't ask him dislike I came here to offer my counsel I'm sorry but I didn't come here to give up my life it's true we gave him the badge but he's he's he's just our intelligence he's not I don't I'm not I'm not gonna put anybody on that throne that doesn't want to be on that throne I'll do it Hey like you said I was if it means if if George isn't ready I'll hold it as long as I can what are you we throw the thing on the throne I won't accept that you're my son the heir to our house the future of us lies in you it's it's the only way to bias time or the rats takeover dragon up dad this is or no one sits on the throne but then how do we get rid of the rats we have to stop the rat threat we have to fight back the illyrians and we can only do that with the power of the throne the throne controls the constructs that gives us the the executioner the Dragon will be able to control all of it and then we can we can clean up the city and fight the illyrians remember though only an heir will give you that kind of control reminds Elric Pluto sitting on the throne would be no different than Johan remaining in that pillar it would not give you complete control over all the constructs of the city it would allow you to contain it would allow us to contain the threat potentially wielding some but the full power of the city can only be wielded by a legitimate heir now if we give all the badges to Johan so that he can help us close the gate can we still then put somebody on the throne to control the constructs Johan would still be able to do help control the constructs as well anyone on that throne will be attuned to the same power that Johan does it Johannes it is merely the case that in order to fully utilize all of its power one must be an heir to the von castle line but then I'm thinking if if if Johan is willing to stay there long enough to help us close the rift and stay there long enough to help whoever sits on the throne so that maybe they can share the burden and control the constructs so if George were to sit on the throne with the help of Johan maybe and and and he wants wants to do the Delirium and George could potentially release Johan from his servitude he's the only one so giving my father the badges to fight this monster close the rift and then put somebody on the throne a legitimate heir then to release my father George with the help of Lucretia Mathias and Johan could control the city and then release Johan from his he was ordered by the king and only the King can that way if it works you get your dad back we get George on the throne and we save Dragonite Eldrick shakes head that's a half-measure again we the whatever Johan is proposing it will be time before we can can't merely give him the power of the seals and then put anyone on the throne we can't we can give them the we can put George on the throne you you want us to go through the portal or no you want us to this portal is gateway whatever this rift is it isn't a port it isn't a true portal from what you've described there's no opening yet it's just up to hare correct correct Yohann if from what you've described from what Johannes said sounds like he may be able to hold that tear from opening further and whether or not an heir or anyone else will be able to close it that depends on them either way it buys us time to study it and I'm holding the amethyst Academy can study it long enough so that we can ignore the queen of thieves saying that she's the only one who can get us in and out of that place if we can study it aldrick Yumi and River the risk that you take is that even with Johan help it's possible that with Johan kept in the castle that George could sit the throne and with johan's support could we may be able to exercise some control but that will mean that anytime Georg attempts to do so there could be some risk to him if you are that may mitigate the risk but we can't eliminate we simply can't eliminate the chance of like we can't be sure that it would eliminate any chance whatever entity is on the other end has of manipulating or harming Georg in some way if we leave the throne empty what happens to the rats they consume us you may need to ask Johan what he can do what power he might still have at least we can decide how to proceed with Jorge once we kill that thing on the throne indeed Jupiter speaks up Jupiter Jones speaks up for all these decision-making it's one thing is clear that thing must be destroyed we have to kill it well then who's coming with us Elias Drexel he stands up I will come with you Jupiter Jones I will as well for those of you who have volunteer know that you may not leave alive what we ask of you is everything el dragón River stand up and Eldrick says I will accompany you to Castle dragon I believe that someone needs to survey the situation I will act as River and I are willing to act as support but this creature we cannot engage with it directly ourselves don't worry guys I'm Sebastian Crowe may have heard of me I'll take care of whatever's on that throne Lucretia Mathias says I cannot fight but I would come with you can you heal I may ask the flame for what miracles I can provide we might need a few miracles so at least you're welcome if my father is to be used trapped in the castle veil I'm sorry I want your guys promise that we're gonna try to get him out afterwards if we can get someone on the throne or by other means of magic maybe the Academy can do some research if their spells are the ones binding him in there maybe somehow but I don't want to go in just with the idea of letting him rot away there Eldrick reaches out to you well if I see it if I see any way but I have to be there before I can answer that question if there is anything that can be done I will study it we'll find something that I all will take you to him veil Pluto while we're doing what we're setting out to do this isn't the end we need to save Drakon hi but we've all made promises to each other the three of us are a team you want to save your father I'm there with you every step of the way one of the hooded lanterns interrupts she come in steps into the room it's one of the hooded lanterns that guards Queen Lenore he says Lenore has asked if she can come to Castle Drakon wait for what purpose she's grown very weak and she says that she just wants she she's asked if she can see it one last time if she commands it she is still the queen I don't think that she's gonna like anything that she sees and there isn't that her husband has laser eyes Theo is right what if what if she takes the throne what if she's the key this monster this beast is corrupted her husband it's yeah they have a connection that goes beyond anything that we might be able to understand what if she's the missing piece I see a coin-flip situation happening and this isn't me saying that it's a bad idea or a good idea it's just me announcing that it's a coin flip them seeing each other if there's any semblance of humanity within that thing on the throne that is still the Queen's husband just in case it wasn't clear for my description just to dispel you of this this creature is definitely not the king the Kings body is flayed and floating around around this thing I thought it was like a that's been to it you know he's like then she's definitely not gonna like what she sees in that throne room well then maybe she will want to help us end it and use her laser eyes or my xerus this still goes to the coin flip or seeing it and witnessing what happens opens her up to similar corruption she's already infused with delirium I know again I'm not saying it's good or bad I'm just throwing out throwing out the coin flip maybe she can hang with the Kree ship for a little bit they can hang out in the back yeah our condition has worsened she is dependent on the haze and the delirium whatever has happened to her she is a creature of this city now it might be the only way that we even give her a chance if we don't take her we might as well just let her die I mean again we said in if anybody volunteers to come they can come and she's volunteering to come yeah so who are we to tell her no I understand your concerns Sebastian and Jo I'm sorry if we sounded like we didn't take into account Johann I hope you know that getting George on the throne the first act is to get Johann out of there Saul speaks up very well if this is the case someone must protect protect young George I would come myself as well but it seems that no one else has left here to command Saul I think you're the best protector for George very well maybe we can keep you in the in the telepathic bond and tell you what we when we've accomplished what we've set out to do that would be my preference and I will leave Petra behind to command the forces that I leave here Petra says Lord Commander I want to come I want to fight we need someone to lead the people that are here my brother go and me nod you want me to believe both of you behind yeah Elias Drechsel says I'm already taking your dad witty so Lord Commander make the ball stay Petra and some if anything happens to both me and your father we need you to run the forces of the city and I trust you more than anyone to do spell they seem disappointed but satisfied with that answer very well Lord Commander and they salute all right gluto sorry jupiter speaks up well Oh commander I'll assemble the Caspian and how many of yours are you were going to bring I'm gonna bring a handful of my best men very well we'll have to ride quickly Eldrick chimes in I won't be able to help we won't all be able to fly if we're going to have to ride through the city as quickly as we possibly can before nightfall indeed Oh once we get to those gates we'll need to use the seals to open the way and get through as quickly as we possibly can can I fly I could do that yeah I just think it would be really cool to fly over the battlefield blasting people from the sky I just I just got a visual in my head I think I have one more potion of flying certainly would you want that hey if you guys need artillery I'd love to get back on a horse I can probably run tests on the horse but I'm gonna horse you you command the foot troops you command the infantry or the cavalry sorry infantry cavalry aerial support we'll have to go through both the Bailey's and get to the keep as quickly as possible isn't there a giant Minotaur between us and there yes what are we going to do about that creature well the good news is in rings we could make a big giant dragon and fight him it's bigger than a regular Minotaur and we've killed a lot of those and there's like a humongous it's a humongous minute capper we're gonna have like triple the fire pal I'm uh I'm concerned that it's gonna distract us from the main mission this is the main mission take back Castle dragon I think we should command the giant dragon of the touch like the Minotaur I think we should try I think that would be a wise choice maybe when you fly up the three of us and try to control that dragon and get the dragon to fight the Minotaur pave the way for the rest of the group and will stand by outside the gates so that all three of us need to fly look very well I will river and I will place the spells upon you as we did before you will fly up and attempt to command the bronze dragon no more running from that rabbit against the the there are other minotaurs as well on the walls it seems to ignore them but if you can command it if you can control it to destroy those defenders and that massive creature that'll give you guys the opening for your attack against the walls of castle track and once you guys are in we're going into the throne room you can meet us there very well do we still need the mercenaries here to protect the camp's we allies drexell says we have troops between the Caspian but if those illyrians are still coming we this is our last chance to hire them I say we hire them all right we have about how much do they cost we had every 100 a day we have a lot of 7,000 okay I can make that time through to the end of the month about 7,500 7,500 what about the is that all the weight Delirium because we we might have collected some more oh we definitely have more we have at least once we secure more the Delirium in the castle the academy will gladly pay for it which can fund your mercenary pursuits if you wish there we go again take the castle Oh keep the mercenaries should we take a big lead by things then before we go to the castle Bigler anything else that you need from the Academy before you go I mean if you don't have to give it the money you know what I'll take that other removable rod who knows certainly how much is it how much 500 yeah they're called bucks do you want to buy because they have a picture of a deer so are we giving the money now or is our the the we're gonna finance it after with the Delirium green you'll need a cash payment upfront to bring them here mmm okay fine you can how much upfront do you need five thousand we'll send this along with the remainder of the Treasury that we have and that will secure a few mercenaries for now how many potions can we buy with two thousand three hundred colt what do you need help oceans we need we need maybe even stuff resources for the troops yeah can we get a hero's feast for everybody marching on that castle is not something we can summon up does anybody can we pay for somebody to cast that spell for us yes we can do that we can arrange that okay how much does that cost a thousand cool thousand bird I hear at least we still have a thousand left health potions yeah health potions would be great slash meat do you guys have invisibility or know you can buy potions of superior healing that to heal 40 hit points for 500 each we're not two of those yeah do you want to hold on to them and if one of us needs them you can assume I already have two from the beholder battle that I didn't drink so Pluto how many do you have give one superior I have a three superior palm and I take both of those then and one greater okay I think we're finally finally spend all that money you will have my spell casting okay should you require it well we are there thank you means a lot you're acting very you're very brave for coming with rumors as well she's also very good and Lucretia says we do not charge as they majors of the Academy do but when a miracle is needed I will pray for you thank you that's all we can ask for you okay um what about spells spell storing I already have all mindful I do you guys want any of my spells or do you want other spells I'm putting two of my own so that I can cast two more fifthly I'm basically giving myself to more fifth level spell slots what about do you want a bunch of shields shields pretty good yeah do what you want Pluto what about find familiar hi because I can have advantage on all right okay it wouldn't be advantage on all of them it helps you once oh yeah one stack okay what about oh boy maybe can I have one more absorb elements yep two shields mm-hmm and I don't know if somebody wants to take a fairy fire do you want another Missy step was pretty fun did you use all your spells out of your ring so two shields and absorb elements and a misty step okay nice write them down boom I still have all mine from before is there anything else you all would like to prepare before you set out you must gather your party before you venture forth you may not be able to return to this point tres Alma hidden lanten hooded lanterns as I go and I say I may not survive this battle but shall it be known as my legacy that the hooded lanterns were full and bellied during my reign here as Lord Commander her raper cookies may you have many cookies in celebration regardless of what happens do good jobs even in death get snacks is this seriously how relieved I turn to Petra Nansemond say if they don't get good snacks I'm gonna come back and haunt you if I don't survive yes Lord Commander thank you let it be known that our final speech before we set out to our death is about cookies could be more important than cookies Sebastian Saul maybe tuna dad maybe tuna um we're gonna go in there and I'm gonna do what you taught me to do best and that's murder it I haven't met a monster that I haven't killed that hasn't killed me yet and I ain't scared of this thing and when I'm done killing it we're gonna get George on that throne and we're gonna do that for for caspia for jacking Haim and to fight back against the illyrians Bluto I should tell you I've lived a long time at 90 years old like Greg you know you're not my firstborn son I've had several sons before you and they've all died doing foolish things like this wait what but you're not just a son of caspia you're my son my ninth one and my only surviving one I don't know if he's 90 years old I don't know if I'll be able to have another son so I know I know that all my faith and our family and the spirits of your brothers that you never met fight alongside you thank you Father I won't let you down cuz I really can't you're a son of caspia and you're my son and when I'm proud of you give me a hug boy it hurts it hurts a lot he's still so strong that was kind of nice right oh that's kind of look I just want you to hug - sure sorry Saul can you do me a favor I pull out my old goggles and I toss them to him give those to my brother in case I don't come back I will and Tobias Crowe sees you off again as well as a bastion as you almost really given it to him I didn't know I was good you know what so I'll pack up to Salt Lake actually my dad's right over there I didn't think I was gonna see him again can i LJ I'll just give them to him Saul it's cool like it's just amazing keeping the family like he's gonna see him before you do and so I go over to Tobias and it's kind of awkward because we've already said bye like twice now where I thought I was gonna go off and die and I'm like all right this

of the forces and she begins to pray over one of the golden pieces of delirium she takes it in front of her and she crushes it in her hands to land as it crumbles a plume of fire emerges in front of her from which forms into a humanoid form from which wings of fire stretch out and it draws forth a pair of flaming swords the angelic figure a woman ten feet tall clad in burning armor with skin of bronze and hair and wisps of flame Lucretia says you look upon the angel Makeda guys this is rad hello Makeda yeah Makeda speaks and she speaks a language that Pluto you've studied celestial she's

words as she flies alongside you towards the castle below you can see the column of the advancing soldiers led by eldritch as the burning trail of the eldritch of the arcane horses illuminates them in the city streets below as they charge through the broken-down gates of temple gate and race through the city streets as you fly overhead they make their way the hooded lanterns fire a hail of arrows as a few rattling x' attack them in the streets but they make their way through and continue their way towards the castle following closely as you fly overhead towards them you come upon Castle Drakon high perched over the city the spires stabbing the cloudy skies like spear tips the darkening clouds overhead threatening a thunderstorm as you wring out as you fly out over the castle walls there is a roar as the bronze dragon awakens from the tower and begins to fly towards you in formation roll up my sleeves in formation we fly I'm like in the center fully doing an Ironman pose flying straight at the bronze dragon so your going rate for it so you go rate for the high power the dragon tower as it like swoops down towards us I'm swooping up towards it hopefully you guys are like I'm right

half damage and I use a win evasion like no damage okay all right look at her in a yell do a barrel roll all right pollute oh I move forward 40 feet beside vo and I just stopped in the air beside her in the name of the king i Pluto Jackson Castle in of of Drac and I command you okay I get a 15 on the saving throw it's not enough so you've got to commanded at this at this stage he's if he is effectively paralyzed by that by the two of you but not commanded yet you'll need one more control Sebastian no pressure Sebastian Crowe darts forward right in between Vale and Pluto what's the line you bet you're the archbishop of in the name of the king I the high mage of Drakon hines sebastian crow command you I didn't get over a ten for a single one of my savings the crackling lightning a bolt of lightning cracks around miners are on filling it with arcane power as it is bent to your collective will what do you want him to do I say come here for a second the dragon flies towards you I just put him on the face and be like the heaving metal you're good just as it moves it's it makes that sound of wrenching metal that say are you a good dragon you're good dragon is gonna help us kill a Minotaur I know the scale man sir I know I can fly but I'm I want to jump on the Dragons back and grab it and be like attack and I point down towards the Minotaur do you guys want on the head is it still sleeping it was with the bolt of lightning it is roused and it it is rude it sees this happening up above the minister yeah more specifically this creature is a demonic Minotaur known as a chorus trow a gory stro guys let's go what was the name of the angel the angel yeah hey de que de and I pull out Makeda Makeda and I pull it engage in Ignatius we're gonna kill a Minotaur and I can I've dominic and I dive bomb on the dragon surfing on its head like ready to go I'm like okay so this is a big open area so we're not we're not gonna worry too much about the minis for now but I do think it is worthwhile yeah we're just flying at this got the dragon - yeah Minotaur from the sky we got that we do have the the - around and we do have the gorilla Oh Minnie so you're just gonna yeah dragon on the dragon angel and Sebastian crows on this guy I'm on him - yeah that's less important per diamond we're we're dive-bombing like that this is what a dive bomb looks like alright you guys all have a visual map so I add Makeda and the greased row into the initiative order guys where are minis who knows they're up on the shelf behind ya one moment just hold them as thank you so Makeda goes after pollute oh and the giris row cause of dead last is that a boy you knows this place okay so this massive hulking beast be aware that in order to continue to control my toes are on do you all do need to continue to concentrate on the effect all right Shay your concentration is broken you may lose control of Anna's arm okay as you bear down upon it vo the gory Stroh it steals its feet digs its heels into the ground and begins to reach down and pick up a shard of one of those huge crystals of delirium like it's gonna throw it at you okay what are you gonna do I am going to take if I use my hand crossbow is it considered it magical shot it is a magic weapon yes okay so I take my hand crossbow out and I shoot the Delirium play with fire we're gonna play with fire close are we to it you are about 300 at the start of the round here but at least 300 feet in the air all right if you want to dive-bomb I'll say that you can double your flying speed so Vale I would say that if you want to just be in range to hit this thing because it's like 40 feet tall itself yeah you can dive bomb and shoot shoot yeah charter de leiria yeah we're doing it as we're coming in we're like no and I'm like holding on my crossbow is this same combat right yeah okay okay using crossbow expert I'm gonna take all my shots on him are you shooting this chart of delirium yeah okay with so it's magic hitting magic okay the idea and then that is going to be 21 to hit the Delirium that hits rule damage [Music] fifteen damage to the shard of delirium cracks but it doesn't shatter take my next shot okay 20 you hit that hits that is 20 damage the shard of delirium explodes firing a burst akin to as a prismatic spray on the area however since the giris TRO is a fiend it is affected differently by the delirium this is what you see the shard of delirium explodes sending a beams of prismatic energy all echoing out with the colors of magic and shards of delirium spray like pieces of glass into the frame of the ghost row as they do as the mist clears around it leaving the the fogging haze the creature breathes in deeply and the shards of delirium melt into its splash and all of a sudden go go go it eaves as these tumors growths form over it and its muscles bulge and it grows in size and the wounds heal over it like it's triggered some sort of hyper regeneration and pieces of the delirium as they grow into it almost as they melt onto its flesh it's almost like they're forming armored plates over its body and it breathes out and heaves with this bulging power that it has now been named out with good this this fight was gonna be too easy level the playing field take my third shot at it and I'm just so like oh I miss completely and I say okay as a result of this the gorilla is now a legendary creature and it gains legendary actions I had to try it try it's ok it's ok when so it suspends its first legendary action and it looks up at you veo and it works back and it's opens its mouth and this beam of arcane energy comes out of its mouth towards you make a dexterity saving 321 you have evasion right yeah golden dragon like in a cool loop-de-loop move in it like dodges this beam of energy and I pad its head yay good job Castle Drakon it gets to act next and another bolt of lightning sails through the clouds and it's gonna strike pollute oh wow don't make a dexterity saving through this is my jam this is what I live for eight you were struck by a bolt of lightning from Castle dragon you know it's because of the armor I'm Superman you were gonna take big old Scooby wow that was a miserable dice roll yes that is going to be 19 points of electrical damage and you need to make a constitution saving throw to concentrate on the dominate wellness things back man oh yeah a mess around yeah I got a nineteen you're good okay Pluto it is your turn Makeda follow me and I dive bomb at this giant demon thing okay so dive bombing I'll let you drop 120 feet straight down with one movement how much bigger did it yet I use a now it's like 60 is our army coming I'm a range of melee still so like yeah yes so I'm gonna just so you're like eighty feet if I'm gonna throw javelins at it okay so I first I Huck javelin numero uno for a 22 no sorry 18 to hit it bounces off newly enhanced delirium hardened hide oh oh boy that time I'm gonna oh ok 19 - hit it would have been a hit before but now it's not Makeda go kill it anything else Pluto I'm I try not to I put my helmet done it fires a beam of energy at you make a dexterity savings you get out of here its mouth Oh charge this laser oh I get a 23 with your dexterity sorry 22 I got a 19 plus 3 okay so you still hey take half him and I throw my shield up the shield of like I deflected off into like a pillar like Ziya Legend of Zelda Sal like from breath of the wild like this beam of the the beam of magical energy comes up and you just deflect it right out of the way send me to the side it crashes into one of the powers there's a small explosion stop so I I throw my shield and I just I kind of just over it into a yeah beam of octet there's no Skinner don't worry Monty the one character who has no way of saving themselves fully is coming up Makeda flies down to meet the creature Makeda dive-bombs and with her flying speed she she is actually she can die bomb 180 feet so she's still not quite in range to hit it either so she is yeah so she's still McKay to go okay Sebastian it's your turn I since I still can fly I actually push off of Makeda with my goggles out and just so that I'm a little bit away from her in case something bad happens here and I pull out my staff of power and I dive bomb towards it so I was on the dragon so did I move with it yes so I move how close am I now to it you are starting your turn 180 feet away how far can I 180 feet above ground yeah so you're a hundred and twenty feet away from where this creature where basically the height of the quarry stroke I dive bomb so I'm within sixty feet of it okay and I pull out the staff of power and I am going to just off of yeah yeah the dragon and I'm going to cast ray of enfeeble mint on it okay it so you have to roll the hit right make a range spell attack yes [Music] 24 that is a hits and then so it makes it saving throws at the end of its turn correct yeah and yeah it deals half damage on strength based attacks okay that's the idea and then I pull I pull up from my dive bomb and kind of like I'm hovering there what is does it require anything what what do you mean oh it was from my staff of power yes it does let's roll that up yeah magic surge yeah you're excited now there's plant potted plant oh here's a good question Thank You Pluto can I concentrate on a spell and on controlling the dragon I know you cannot does Raven payment require concentration yes do you want to retcon this because I reminded you of that once already I know it's an important thing we if we lose some control of the dragon and maybe we can still kill it no no you're right oh man all Mae's enrolled the wild magic surge yet but you did roll to hit so you're kind of committed to this course of action but can I will I will grant you a mercy what would you like to I will grant you a mercy but you will not get to choose another course of action I'm sticking with it oh and I quicken that spell and then use the is it a spell when I control although no I need to concentrate yeah yeah yeah I'm sticking with it it's what I said I was gonna do go for it do it do it roll that you roll your your magic let's see what happens I regret my choices 48 48 do I roll twice or is that only in gas you roll twice it's the unicorn 21 Oh 21 wait the Unicorn is one yep bring the unicorn back man the other one is creatures have disadvantaged on saving throws against the next spell you cast over the next minute one two three it's the disadvantage four five six we got another unicorn we got no unicorn vanish Charles isn't appearing tonight but in this but as I blasted with rave and feeble mid it gets hyper weakened and the green energy like wraps around it and I'm focusing on that beam of green energy but in doing so I've stopped paying attention of the dragon right behind me okay so mine is arund is its - Aaron's turn unfortunate - or ond the grease forgets its led its last legendary action it's gonna blast you Sebastian with its make a dexterity seeing through you've got this kid I got a 9 you fail a beam of octarine energy fires out towards you and collides with you enveloping you holy you are going to take a grand total here of yeah I'm making great choices tonight of 30 necrotic damage cool cool make a concentration check for rayvin feeble mint now thank you of war Castro don't you but you - yeah that's that's gonna be a 28 okay so the fact but you still take 30 points of damage - around it's why his runs turn but unfortunately without three people controlling it - Iran is effectively inert and so does nothing he just stops in the air yeah he just stops in the air I'm like whew yeah okay well I mean I I turn around and I'm like oops it's fine he's not attacking us but he's not doing anything magic is hard okay BAE oh it's up to you I didn't take my crossbow out and I continued to fire at this crazy thing we shall see 13 that is a complete mess it does not even penetrate its regular hide Oh 23 that is a hit did the Korres stroke girl go oh I forgot the Crestron oh yeah right okay I will pop oh yeah enfeebled him so that he'll okay this although now I'm still remaining multi to give us it yes but that's fair uh yeah so the gray Stroh is going to reach into the earth and pull up a massive rock and it throws it at who is Clues come the closest I'm within sixty feet of it yeah it's gonna kata house right yeah Makeda is the closest but you guys have all attacked it so it's gonna fire it's gonna hit someone that actually hit him with an attack it's gonna be Sebastian cuz he's the closest well so Sebastian he does a disadvantage on this attack that's good or is it half damage much damage okay okay so he gets a thirty two to hit I don't think so wait what does what about that thing what we're did the wild magic do oh yeah what the wild magic is disadvantage on his neck saving throw at the me yeah yeah okay so bunch of damage coming in good good so it would have been 38 points a bludgeoning damage but it's four but it's half that so it's going to be nineteen bludgeoning damage instead and you need to make a strength saving throw a strength saving for oh yeah you got this fifteen you fail you are checked in the air you were sent flying 20 feet and knock prone which means that because you're not prone while you're flying you fall how high in the area sixty feet above him so you got so above him so that's a hundred and twenty feet so you now fall well how close are you to me do you have a reaction I asked that I saw as a reaction yeah what's the range of a feather fall sixty feet you're within sixty feet you can use your reaction did you know okay so Sebastian feather falls to the ground and land safely Oh God and you see me just disappear into the hair I'm just like no veo Zee plummeting and then I fall so what am I pictured pigeons feathers I like toss it out to the heirs I cast it nice ski so now it is your turn by now so okay you'd want to pack that hit yes with 19 damage okay and then bonus action nope okay and I that's it I'm just on the drag Energon um you gotta roll it I got a 19 you're good and I failed my saving throw because of the disadvantage to shake off the effect actually wait what's it's a Constitution saving throw yes and I got a 23 all right okay so the Raven field woman is gone great okay this is a gray so he uses its legendary action to run over to Sebastian no this is fine and castle Drakengard bolt of lightning hits Vale very okay make it a dexterity saving throw 14 that is no failure fine I could take half to image so the bolt of lightning crashes out from castle Drakon and below that is going to be a grand total of 30 points of lightning damage like half okay make your constant concentration check for your you go get a dc-10 concentration check for your control of mine is armed sorry what so you can because you're concentrating on dominate monster yes your final you succeed okay hon your console you know it's your turn bolt of lightning the screaming greased row pouring over Sebastian 60 feet tall it's poised to just stomp on him I how big is he he's only what 60 feet tall he's basically a gargantuan creature now he's 60 feet tall like 30 feet this broad shoulder 30 feet wide bulging muscles delirium energy going through its entire I fly right at him okay I'm gonna go right for his the big old back I'm gonna go right for his back and just try to chomp into him with ignatius and I get out yeah I get a big 28 that is a hit there we go now we're cooking with fire with golden fire [Music] oh boy 22 damaged nice and then I want him to wait he's a gargantuan fruit you know something like that yeah it was huge now he's graduate by a gargantuan what's it so big because veo made delirium explode on yeah we're gonna Oscar I don't know he's gonna absorb it it's not carrying anything is it no it's basically naked it has these big golden van braces on its arms and some some piercings on its horns I'm gonna use manoeuvering attack okay and it's gonna take another 8 damage nice and Sebastian uses reaction to run away he can move half his speed right yeah up to half his speed when fortunate Sebastian's grown so he can crawl fight but he can no I I can fly I can stand up using 15 feet and then fly 15 feet 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks do that because now it's in combat with Pluto and I fly back up and 15 feet out into the air okay as I continue my assault on this evil creature getting a oh I'm gonna use the big old lucky that in to a nice okay for another 20 damage nice and then one more attack oh baby oh baby gonna use a 25 to hit for with precision strike for another AIDS 1625 damage Wow and then I want to use big old maneuvering attack and I go Makeda there's your opening nice alright no sorry what's the other one I already forget it the distracting strike Oh to give advantage and it's gonna take another seven damage nice okay the grease Joe uses its legendary action to to basically pitch at Pluto with its horns this is a Gore attack ah getting a 32 hit ow I accept thanks thanks for that [Music] so Pluto you're gonna take big old wow that really Pluto you take fifty five points of piercing get horns and as you dive down into it it turns around just takes the horns and stabs into you thankfully because of all the extra hip points I'm not quite bloodied yet but it's really close okay I mean there's a horn in you okay turn your believe it kada flies down and attacks the gory Stroh twice hitting only ones advantage does she have good the advantage oh yeah that was the advantage hips and then the second attack doesn't have advantage so it hits to overtax hips yeah she hurt her swords light up she slices them down and deals a grand total of 50 points of damage to the giri's room what kind of damage is it is radiant damage gettime mckay to get him yeah as as this flurry of flight and glowing blades cuts into the demonic fall in the creature it's uh it is out of legendary actions because it costs to to move so it is now going to go to Sebastian I turn to face the creature and hold out my staff and from behind it the shadows of its own shadow starts to bubble and all of a sudden Reaper leaps out attacking it from behind okay I'm gonna do a little a little Reaper attack 17 that is a Miss well he tried but I then point my staff Adam and I say what do demons have nightmares about and I cast a mental prison okay okay here so it has disadvantage on the saving throw which cancels at its magic resistance so I have to make a what kind of saving intelligence I have a -2 on this I hope so I get to ya and mentally in prison what happens so what do demons have nightmares about basically you know what the things that demons have nightmares about is something that is better left unsaid so a swirling nice stop it a swirling Mirage of horribleness yeah sure you guys can yeah it's kittens it's getting as as far as Vail and Pluto concerned its kittens but whatever this demon gets surrounded by shadowy nightmares and it starts screaming in fear as I hold it in place and my eyes start glowing purple as I'm floating there in the air with my staff and in a booming voice I'm like speaking in aldrick incantation it takes five d-10 psychic damage immediately Oh dice it can't see or hear anything beyond it and it's restrained for the spells that spells duration I'm sticking with this one really good not the kids it's surrounded by kittens playing with yarn and it's in a land of cotton candy I like to imagine that that like the demons nightmares aren't like the opposite of like the demons one of nightmares about nice things they know nice things are dumb like the things that night they don't know that nice things are nice things that demons have nightmares about if you guys want to think it's kittens great but it's not kids like it's it's just you know it's it's 33 damage I think I think you know what Dean's probably have nightmares about having to do their taxes yeah menial tasks menial tasks retail jobs iron your loincloth the epicness of this spell you have to us on him doing menial tasks and taxes but it's 33 damaged kittens that leaves it bloodied yay I don't know if it's gonna escape the mental pursue yeah so it's restraint - yeah it is restrained so all attacks against that have advantage and no one is in range of it you can't see anybody around it because of the illusion whoo so it can't see anybody so it's and it is restrained its thrashes and rages and screams out in horror that's all it does [Music] and it doesn't get any saving throws to get out of it now okay that's it and I'm just hovering a bunch of above the battlefield God like yep with my glowing purple eyes as far we are we still hurting it though yeah okay cool kill it kill it dead yeah Baio it's your turn yet because it can't see anything beyond the illusion and it is restrained all your attacks against that have advantage all right I still use my crossbow and wow that was two fours I'm literally shooting something that is the size of the broadside of a barn yeah and you hit it directly it's you you hit it directly the arrows just don't go through it there was a high wind it came in on an angle all right second shot there we go double crits double crits double crit that doesn't mean anything that doesn't mean anything it means something to us amazing everything all right so you get your sneak dice on this so the sneak attack is maximized how many is your sneak dice now it's 46 now you're level 12 before so it's 4 d6 what's your bonus the damage roll that plus 14 so this is gonna be 38 plus whatever you roll this there you go [Music] no it's too big it's too freakin baby everything is larger tomorrow so you just did a grand total of racket 61 points on a cross oh nice it cries out in pain although the pain of its wounds is only secondary to having to find out exactly they love the pain of the illusion where now it's trying to find all of its gas receipts oh oh I forgot to claim my deductions for my business trip where's January to March where's January March I still need my t4 raise you're the only one who can speak its language so you're hearing all this and the rest of us that must be really bad oh it is I guess my last attack using crossbow expert yep yeah 21 that's a hit nice 20 damage nice all righty Pluto bring this thing home I just start seeing it just standing there I just start whaling on it my opening given to me a brutal 15 damage [Music] a 20 Hits right yeah 4 or 15 damage again come on Pluto here we go and then 21 damage nice restrained within its mental prison Pluto and Makeda cut it to pieces the two of them flying around it with their radiant blades digging deep into its flesh and the Beast collapses to the ground can you get the dragon please hold I'm just on the dragon in the air still like heyy it's basically why what

that let's return to the ruins as the massive form of the mutated gory stroke collapses onto the ground of the courtyard before the main castle doors to the cap the key of castle Drakken the thundering hooves of the vanguard forces arrive beside you Eldrick river Jupiter Jones Elias Drexel Lucretia Matthias they have all come Eleanor and Queen Lenore have all come or as Queen Lenore is brought down from her horse by one of the hooded lanterns she falls to her knees and audibly begins to weep pulling at her mask well she can't Clinton to that she can't pull her tears away she says the castle I run up to her and I say milady your home but it's not your home just remember that as you go through she breathes in it still feels like home but in a new way this my Gardens and she stares off into the distance I drink a potion of superior healing are you hurt says Lucretia Matthias as I'm about to drink it I'm like yes should I not drink this she speaks a few words and she casts prayer of healing over the course of a minute and she's gonna use a higher-level spell slots for this one for you all and yeah so that's gonna be five anymore Lucretia casts the spell so each of you regain 25 hit points it feels great I see Makeda has already proven her value yeah she definitely helped out very much needed fighting this thing it it grows in strength from the Delirium Eldrick speaks we should get inside quickly I will create a protective barrier that we can for those of us that are staying behind can some of the Caspian Xin hood Atlanta and stay with us yes yes should the hooded lanterns stay with them and we'll take all the Caspian with us yeah yeah well I mean Jupiter's kind of in charge right I want to fight this thing let's kill it okay as do i this is Elias Drexel away I mean yeah you can come with us [Music] there's peril a three-headed lanterns three Caspian and three of each stay behind with River and he'll wreck you okay and Lucretia as you come in the main gates of Castle Drakon look down upon the Great Hall Eldrick begins forming his own tiny Hut hmm I will create this to protect us we will stay here in the main hall you are all heading up to the throne room then yes yes Elias Truxel speaks up Lord Commander what's our plan of attack you scouted through this area are there many more creatures wandering the halls here do we need to be on our guard I think we need to be on our guard for rats just in case they've made their way to the castle I think that there are ground attacks and there are levels above that we can attack from as well I think it's best for the Rangers to be up top should also be aware that there may be a large armored Minotaur with a flaming sword roaming the castle still walking around that is the prince but there is a balcony above the throne room so those of you who are ranged attackers might be better suited to take that balcony and lay down a blanket of fire fail where do you want to be think above us best I think I'll go above - okay I'll stand beside it the charge on below yeah you and Jupiter very well we're gonna run at it what weapons does allies visit melee or she's completely capable and both in both I turn to Elias and I say Elias range or do you want to get in its face I'd like to get them up close and personal but this thing sounds horrific I think if it's all the same to you Lord Commander I'll come in from the top survey the situation and if they need support down there I'm more than happy to go down all right you're a perfect middle man actually I think we should all stay up top to start and kind of work our way down because it definitely expressed that it has an aura of death that comes out of it I mean you are quite natural at jumping off balconies like I don't want to just go in and just explode like I would rather also survey allies you actually that was really smart of you Jupiter her to go upstairs first and we're just gonna take a quick peek peekaboo then they okay so we all go in on the balcony yep we lay down some initial fire you have some javelins yeah and we we just we figure out the best way to approach I'm also worried that it might have creatures that it can summon attention I can handle summoned creatures pretty well I hope I faith in you shall we then the last March of Dragonforce [Music] for now I never thought I'd be setting foot in this place again it seemed like an impossible dream I can't believe you brought us this far Lord Commander about the three of you the three of you change in a few short months what I thought we'd be to fight me fighting four years together I'm sorry that I'd never trusted you fully and completely from the beginning but your brave souls and I'm glad to fight that need be die beside you agreed I think these last three months have changed all of us and that we've come this far as amazing but just remember that it may have been a dream to get in this castle but it may turn into a nightmare keep your wits about you and hopefully we can all come out of this alive certainly is there any other support that I can offer you can you uh turns invisible give give me some mage armor certainly he cast me armor on you now I have like shimmering purple armor over my body ooh it's like see-through magic armor what does that do that puts my armor up [Music] Lucretia Mathias says when you are ready I will speak a blessing for you but you will need to go quickly for its magic will not last long hmm are you coming up to the doors outside upstairs or are you staying down here I will come up when you destroy this creature okay um if you are hurt Makeda will follow you Eldrick can you [Music] [Music] pastilla trace it would be have to be on the person that's kasi right Elric cannot cast pass with that trace guys do you want to be quiet as we go up I mean what do you think just get in and in its face is gonna be best I think we just we're gonna Pluto this Pluto are we gonna Pluto this if we just go upstairs we can just kind of take a look poker Hudson I think okay okay what do you want to do I thought we're going in upstairs I just wonder are we trying to sneak in upstairs you're the one who's the expert at sneaking I can wait outside you guys go me in all right I say we make our way upstairs outside the doors see if we can clear the path if there's anything in our way and then we'll go in from there if we can open the door crack I can send Croley in just to take a quick look let's see what's in there okay yeah I like that I ready okay I turn to my men Lord Commander we're at your side prepare yourselves for the most disgusting thing you've ever seen like hopefully you didn't have too much of a hero's feast because it's gonna come up I should be quite specific for the with regards to the hero's feast I just want to double check here how many people can actually be affected by it only 12 creatures can partake in the heroes fees one two three we have eleven okay is that including like is Jupiter there and Schaller Saul's back at camps Elias is here Jupiter's here three each s three and that's it oh and Angel okay did she get the fee she doesn't she is uh Lucretia with us or is she she's not she she's staying behind she said the Queen is staying behind because she's not gonna fight okay yep although we're coming in upstairs yeah did you and did you guys want to take a short rest before you go in um I mean I personally don't need to it gives me quite a few things back okay well this gives me um you can spend any hit dice if you're taking damage okay yeah let's take a short rest before we barge in there okay so I guess you planned who was gonna come in in advance and that those are the ones that got the hero's feast okay alright I'm back up to full how about you Pluto I'm ready I'm full I'm ready to go ok well alrighty so are you guys going in through the balcony we're going on top of me on the top level okay and we're gonna first open the door crack and I'm gonna send Crowley through okay you head up the stairs the main stairs of castle dragon to the topmost level where the Royal Apartments are this is where you found the statue of another demon you open up the door crack sending Crowley squeaking through into the throne room covered in tendrils of flesh the throne room is a mockery of the artistry it once was its its gilded pillars and painted ceilings now a scene of desecration where pieces of delirium have been chained up in the floors wrapped around from this malignant tumor of a massive creature that is suspended in between the floor and the ceiling so the actual creature itself is this massive bloated mass of flesh that dangles some roughly about ten feet off the floor like the there's this mass of bile that pools underneath it and the chains holding it in place that almost seemed like there might be connected to a connected to it but it's clear now from looking at it clearly that it is floating in the air although there are these tendrils that reach up and almost and the chains that almost entirely hold it in place where it is the there is this semblance of a visage bloated eyes and a yawning maw the whole thing is just a wet sack of flesh chains and bile around it are several giving gibbering demonic forms creatures that have been twisted beyond all semblance of rolling flaps of flesh and limbs and mouths and eyes roiling over each other almost like a human form has been liquefied several of them trundle around the balcony others lumber in the gallery below how many are on the balcony yes we can't be surprised that we left them all in four days and they just come onto that portal yeah there's perhaps say almost 10 up here maybe 10 more down below after seeing all of this I bring Crowley back he lands on my shoulder all right guys we've got 10 up top and a whole swarm of them down at the bottom you guys ready to clear out some demons Pluto it's what you do best this is what I was built for say we clear out the top and then go for the bottle absolutely okay who's going at first so Vail noted the hooded Lantern's will act after your initiative Pluto the Caspian will act after your initiative and Sebastian McKay doe will act after your initiative and for the purposes of simplicity each of you will control your respective group ok ok ok roll for initiative come on dice come on dream huh yes Sebastian 2024 Sebastian 23 for me 23 for veo 18 okay I guess that decides who's going to bless us yes you are blessed well meson attacks yeah so this creature actually goes last even though it'll roll the natural 20 on its initiative [Music] but Pluto only got 18 I got a 18 I know it has a - door - oh oh oh that's good to know guys that's good to know oh I mean we know that it sucks at Dex that's handy okay - no okay all right so you got the upper floor over there and the lower floor over there so effectively so that you know for the the battle map the the four pillars furthest away from the throne correspond to the corners of the balcony does that make sense yes yeah for our battle cam will we be able to see or just ideally see an entire room itself yes I can okay maybe we can put them up here or something yeah it I tried to balance it but it's a little too heavy to stack it on top or like we can just put our miniatures yeah along the wall well cuz the positioning might be important so I would actually that's why I said it that's the real thing unless okay okay okay so from the moment you open the doors all right we will be an initiative order so Vale you are the first act okay open the doors there's a dude right there and I just yeah as soon as I send all of you rowing from the top floor correct yes okay I know that we're down here right now but we're all I imagine two people open the doors and I'm already standing there with my crossbow ready and I'm like it's me employee oh look and I start turning use my dread ambusher open the door and I'm gonna start to wail on the first thing I see which is that pink palace smudge [Music] so I take my first attack 10 that is actually a miss not your blood oh yeah sir yeah you're blessed so that will make it a hit yeah go go go so you're a little thrown off but the blessing of the sacred fire rights your aim and you hit this wretched creature like beam of light shines on the 21 damaged with a wet pop it explodes in a cloud of putrescence and there's another one there too the smaller one all right okay I think they're all effectively the same creature go on take another shot oh yeah 24 5 to hit also a hit 20 damage the second shot fires straight through it leaving behind a pop as it collapses and its innards melt away I I actually looked straight across and I see one of the other big fat ones and I aim for that one 14 that is a hit 19 damage nice for the big fat one over there it hits its head ripping through pulling out brain matter and gray matter at the backside of it and then I go to the wrestle back to me the next furthest one away that route that I can see across the room and I take my last shot therefore my dread ambush shirt I get an extra shot with that okay and if a hill clears out most yeah get them it's like 16 also a hit 16 damage incidentally doesn't destroy it these are bloodied what wha yep alright and then I say have a time boys okay the hooded lanterns rush into the room Elias Drexel rushes forward with his axes to engage those two he makes two attacks yellow which hits shutting down one of them and the hooded lanterns each fire two attacks under direct with both the Lord Commander and Elias Drexel the three hooded lanterns are each able to kill one of one creature on the top level yeah I say spread out perfect and I stay where I am okay you know what is so we're in the hallway and it can go around right correct pardon me so the where we are is it oh the upper level is exactly this like the hallway is the same on both floors basically okay yeah all right I'll stay where I am from okay next up is Sebastian and McKenna Sebastian runs in am I able to see those guys over the over the railing yes all right so I run in and I'm just going to shoot a fire bolt at the one that I see in front of me okay [Music] 27 that is a hits [Music] fifteen damage that's the same one that Vale had killed or hurt bullet is resistant to the flames it is enough to destroy it whoo yeah and then does Makeda have a ranged attack or Makeda does not have ranged attacks how far can she go she can fly 90 feet she flies in and flies up to the last one okay on the second level and she easily dispatches it like it's not even there this is body quicker with fear no her blessed blades just burn it away like it's not even there and as it as she comes into the room Makeda speaks and says this vile creature is a gatekeeper a severe ex don't listen to its vile intellect it will deceive you and rack your mind as she's saying that Sebastian's peering over the ledge because he's never actually seen it with his own eyes and he looks down upon the creature on the throne and it's not good he he has a moment it's kind of scary mm-hmm oh man oh geez yeah oh boy Sabir ex it's voice echoes out here - and you can hear its it is almost like a symphony of screams with every word it speaks in your heads and it says hi open the way cascading worlds and all realities you shall be the markers that bring forth my Master's plan he was welcome welcoming us to Dragon him yeah castle Dragon Queen I look for anything and it as it does so it uses its first legendary action to cast feeble mind on Sebastian can I dispel it you want to try to counter spell it yeah try Bel Canto nurse now it's like everyone we already have feeble minds he's the strongest man here okay do I get bless on that it is this yeah yeah we'll see less applies and is it a saving throw no counter spell so you add your charisma mod plus you're blessed to try to counter spell it you need to get an 18 this is it's an 8 level spell isn't a spell cast on ability that's gonna be 28 nice you block the magic of the spell as it tries to pull apart your mind and break your reality not today demon I block a it hurts a little I see you struggling and I'm like buddy what are you doing it's getting into my brain Oh Claus at the back of my mind something like that it is Castle drakken's turn Oh God okay guys it's not good in here it's not cool okay I'm worried the roping tendrils and of flesh pull their way up from the ground and in circle around Sebastian and the hooded lanterns all of you need to make next it need need to make strength saving throws oh the headed lanterns the hooded lanterns Elias everyone on the balcony basically um guys what I go in first what are there you got they get a +2 I'm being brave no 15 for one of them ten for another 12 okay they're all restrained and Elias Drexel is also restrained would you get unrestrained you're a strange okay and the chaotic swim Makeda is also restrained no Makeda okay it's not burn next up is pollute Oh Jackson and the Caspian so come on boys let's show what's going on I know if we don't die suddenly ah good speech I run in Caspian state help your friends what are they restrained by their restrained by the tendrils of flesh I command them to start just shopping at the flesh okay they do so the I will roll for each of the caspian yeah try to break out one of the their respective hooded lanterns none of them succeed but Jupiter Jones and Jupiter Jones doesn't manage to break out Elias Drexel either oh my gosh they're so strong do you manage to break out Sebastian Crowe are you doing something different how far away is the big tentacle monster flesh mound thing well from where you're standing on the balcony like if I come into the room see Europe you're about 40 feet away [Music] do I go for it it's your turn man misty step onto it what okay so you Missy step right onto of it and I just start cutting into its fleshy okay core and just start dry dry and ice cream the light to you what point lucky for a 20 to hit that is a hit for Josh John John 14:23 damage and then I swing again I like a 25 to hit for a 16 damage and I swing again and it's completely okay so I'm just starting you are on top of it stab it down upon it and it says no no stab the flesh comes back oh okay and the cast means they're just trying to free the friends okay so it will use its legendary action now to squirt bile at you pollutant excuse you're already saving through excuse you which one I'm gonna use indomitable and I get a 15 that is a failure oh you take 37 points of acid damage Oh the acid it burns and it will also spend a legendary action because it also gets a chance to do so after the caspian stearns as well and it's turns coming around it will squirt bile at Sebastian because of the angle do I've cover uh you're restrained so you I'm gonna say that cancels the disadvantage that you have on your saving throw but no so you make a dexterity saving throw dodge it [ __ ] it I mean strain that I'm trying to like dodge eighteen that is a failure yeah come on and you take twenty eight points of acid damage you just kind of corks this vial mixture of sizzling flesh on my face and delirium sludge at you we come to its turn remember the girls and it says okay you O going to die the magic that you think protects you will not do so here and it casts dispel magic on your hero's feast no on every once it has to target one person at a time with it so it's going to tap target Pluto first with the spell magic okay so I have to beat a sixteen with my spell casting ability check your heroes feast is gone and I get a hit on it right yes ba-bum ba-bum but the effects of your hero's feast are gone what was it 12 you lose the yeah you lose the twelve hit points and you are no longer immune to poison which is going to be very relevant because you are now in its aura of contamination oh we up on the balcony in matura no the balcony is safe from the aura of contamination oh good I'm just gonna it's only as 19 to hit that is a hit oh gosh for e21 damage okay and I Drive Ignatius into it is it concentrating on anything spells it is not no it is not bummer we go now to the top of ah yes we have one last surprise oh the door behind you opens up no in a massive Minotaur with a flaming sword steps out behind you hauls the sword up and over and brings it down upon you it can certainly try dodge I'm sorry he attacks you three times doesn't rate sword that's a lot getting a twenty-seven twenty-seven and a eighteen to hit well I'm gonna use my uncanny dodge on one of those okay to have the damage yes okay so the first hit deals twenty points of slashing damage at ten and another five points of fire damage and the second hit does another twenty points of slashing damage plus four fire damage and the last hit does ooh ouch does a total 26 slashing damage and another nine fire damage oh cool they oh it is now your turn is it based with me he is he is unique right up to me yep yep all right I for the sake of the battle cam I might move this here yeah it's on the floor above yeah that's fine because I'm outside the doors I Oh there you can get out of there the massive form of the mutated leonard von Kessel standing almost 14 feet tall clad in bursting plate armor and wielding a flaming sword of burnished iron as he crashes down behind you and brings his blame upon you and you can see this crazed look in his eyes like his will is not his own and I just say listen Leonard I know we didn't get along as kids I mean used to play tricks on each other a lot but this is just this is a bit much and I casas that first strike he's my feline agility and I boot it towards the stairs okay and as I get there I overhear okay um I get there and and you see in the stairs you can hear the screeching of rats as a moving see as you look down the stairs upon a moving sea of rattling huh are we are we have our mental connection yep cuz the rats came and I take my longbow and I aim it at Leonard okay and I am using my advantage on myself for strike to take a big ol shot 21 + 27 hit that is it hits okay [Music] forty-two damage Wow okay eat it eat it eat all of it okay and then I take another shot at him with my long bow oh natural one natural one fun and are there rats up the stairs no there you can hear them there they're probably on the bait coming up from the basement basically okay I'm gonna just get to like the top the stairs where I can still see them but I like I just want a like a so you're going up yeah okay okay yeah but like I still want to like keep an eye on him just so I'm not like getting blended well from where he's at okay but kind of like half cool the hooded lanterns are restrained so each of them try to break out of their restraints and all of them succeed and so does the liest Rexel babies my kin um and we go to Sebastian what does it take to break out of the restraints you need to spend your action to make a strength check or you can teleport or do something else we're gonna break out because I'm a strong boy you get a team you break out yeah and I turn and I come back to the door and you see lenses I see Leonard and I'm like stop messing with my friend and I spray some web out of the web out of the web out of out of my staff and just stick him right there between those two walls okay he will need to roll the dexterity saving throat start of his turn and I use because I use my action to break out I'm gonna quicken the website oh yeah okay what is Makeda Makeda is also restrained so does she break out come on Makeda he does she breaks it as well and she soars back and just flies right at Leonard okay she flies back towards Leonard just regards the door from him okay cool are you on the balcony so yourself yeah I'm right in the doorway behind behind Makeda cool the the severe X is going to cast use its legendary action to cast dispel magic on you Sebastian it's see me um let's find it cuz I am like in the doorway so there's five ten fifteen fifteen feet of balcony I think it reaches up and hits you it can see the bout like it can see everybody that's on the balcony from it is because it it does it it reaches up the whole way like it's it is gigantic in its in its size oh yeah but it does not dispel your hero's feast I shrug it away not now something okay listen Leonard's just predicting his dad yeah and I'm protecting you Thank You castle Drakon goes next and see seems in reality crash open and several more of these misshapen creatures spill out onto the balcony on the opposite side on the opposite side of us [Music] the sabir X is going to then use its next legendary action to squirt bile at Pluto Hey excuse you make it extra ready saving throw it's so rude sometimes eighteen that is a fail oh and that is going to be oh oh my god that is going to be 41 points of acid damage oh it burn No Bluto it's your turn it's burnt I feel really alone and isolated right now so here the Caspian coming down to help you Hills just died from the fall actually just I imagine that you just fall off the bridge and just hit like Al and funny and just lay there wasn't it your choice to put them on the balcony the clothes come well I mean I'm not gonna just go insane

attacking my friends and 20 that is also a hit yep for its I'm getting tired of math 18 okay you're just cutting off swaths of this creatures flesh and it appears like it cannot feel the physical sensation of pain otherwise it would probably be screaming or maybe it's just always in pain 22 hit that is a hit 421 damage guys the helmet came off and then I'm gonna bonus action heal a little bit okay 419 health whoa okay I'm standing there we'll use its legendary action to squirt bile at you again bring it on I ain't scared I'm a little scared I'm actually to be honest chasms I'm telepathically telling you I'm scared but I tell him that I'm not scared and we're for saying nice words to you like Pluto you could do it you're Caspian you kill monsters one more thing I have your list you've got 39 points of acid damage ah the acid Sebastian's freaking out on one side his one friends getting sprayed with acid on the other side there's a demon who was like tracking down his his cat friend cool and can only do so much the severe X will then do the Costigan's do anything the the Caspian do know what to do they're up on the balcony and they did they charged yeah they race across the balcony as fast as they can to engage the others is Jupiter capable of going down yeah and Jupiter's gonna leap down yeah man Jupiter Jones leaps down he he takes damage in the process so he takes 20 points of damage from jumping down and lands prone but he's got enough movement to stand up and he strikes at one of the creatures beside him and kills it Thatta boy and this abhi wrecks the severe ex its its turn now and it uses squirt bile on it gets to make attacks with its bite and chains and so it brings in its chains and chains against you Pluto making 3-chain attacks against you excuse you getting at 22 a 25 and a 12 to hit and eyeshield nice locking off does that block all of them I have 25 25 it gets a 25 on one of the hips okay so one gets through one does get through okay the one hit that gets through deals 20 points of peers oh boy oh mercy and then it uses squirt bile against Jupiter Jones who fails the saving throw and out Jupiter Jones takes 35 points of damage of damage and Jupiter Jones is bloodied as well oh no oh and they're demons swarm then the demons three of them rush over to you Pluto and the remainder rush to surround Jupiter Jones none of them get through your shield thank goodness but Jupiter Jones does take 10 points of damage from their attacks Jupiter Jones is bloodied is the monster bloodied it can I tell it that the fleshy demon it is bloodied yeah whoa then we go to Leonard who is in the web he makes the saving throw against the web he gets a 18 No okay he comes charging through the webs is that Sebastian right in front of it no that's uh Makeda are you on the balcony I'm one I'm five feet behind Makeda okay he comes right towards you because you're the one that webbed in through Makeda yes he barges rate past Makeda and he is ten feet reach so if he's up but with McCadden you can get to you oh it's okay it's okay makes three attacks getting a 30 a 23 and a 13 two of them hit okay I'm not even a shield will save me the first hit does 22 slashing damage and 9 fire and the second hit does 17 slashing and 7 fire oh I'm bloodied I'm bleeding pretty good and Leonard's gonna come into the vestibule enough so that he he seems to have a keen tactical mind he's taking cover so that he there's no like he moves in as best he can actually he's gonna plow right past does he get an opportunity attack from it yeah he did but he doesn't care he takes it Makeda hits him she swipes at him but yeah he's just gonna run a trample right through onto the balcony so he's now based with three hooded lanterns and Elias Drechsel yep and he takes 25 points of damage as Makeda slashes at him good job Makeda nice yeah so nice to the top with Vail alright um so he's gone back in and I can't see him anymore right correct so I'm going to and the rats are running up the stairs oh I'm going to use my bonus action to - using my cutting action mm-hmm I'm gonna get sixty feet and that door that's on this building is not on the on the does not exist on the upper level yeah and you don't have eyes on anything right um so I'm gonna pop a superior healing potion okay cool 40 right yep okay what are the minute lanterns gonna do they are going to attack the Prince the Prince they take out their swords and attack Leonard one hits to hit then one crits so I'm cheering them on let they slash into Leonard and encircle him letter takes 20 points of damage total from the attacks actually leaving Leonard bloodied and what about Elias Elias you see it's right here he's gonna go in on Leonard as well go for it align lands one solid hit and deals another 15 points of damage yeah to Leonard now the severe X is going to use its legendary action to squirt bile at Pluto no you're just getting by help all over that poor armor hey I've I've taken so much vials damage oh that sounded like a lot [Applause] I got a 13 that is a failure that is gonna be another 33 points of acid damage so I'm gonna use absorb elements okay cuz that would kill okay so that's your reaction and he's only 17 damage okay maybe yep so it's not that six yeah oh my gosh that's a lot of damage okay yeah so you have resistance to ask the damage that the start of your next turn that's key Sebastian is your turn [Laughter] okay okay okay um okay okay is Sebastian so I guess I should say I totally forgot the the monsters on the on the top level would have charged the Caspian and actually one of the Caspian is killed and eaten yep I need I need everybody to save me from Leonard because I'm I'm gonna try to save what are you doing so I skirt around Leonard okay to the edge of the balcony okay I can see Pluto and Jupiter and they both are getting ripped apart by demons yes true and I pull out my staff and point it down and I'm going to twin polymorph turning both of them into t-rex's nice I only have one t-rex miniature [Music] should keep you alive game changer so let's use this as their t-rex form d'Hiver yeah all right I suddenly feel so strong leaving me vulnerable to Leonard but alrighty hopefully saving my friends alright if I can keep concentration on cool the severe X is going to use its legendary action to cast dispel magic on Pluto it counterspell that does it do it verbally it does not it the severe X its innate it does do it verbally yet it does speak the spell yeah yeah it doesn't it's super quiet it doesn't need material components yeah there's no material it's an eighth spell casting why do you ask okay so can I counter spell it yes you can oh you're not getting rid of my T Rexes not that easily okay it's Makeda Stern Makeda is just gonna lay into to Leonard with with everything whatever her best moves are cool she attacks twice of course she misses both times that was a cool little that wasn't great that's not what I wanted a natural one well why do you have to roll so good for the bad guys Monty well you know the dice giveth and the dice taketh away they just took my life man okay uh all right Castle Drakon sends a pulse radiates through all the delirium and Castle Dracula severe acts no restoring 70 hit points to it is no longer play [Music] Pluto it's your turn you're a t-rex I just start thrashing at the severe excess are you inviting or tail biting for 28 and then tailing you oh I can make this yeah you can tail one of the little guy bite it and then I'm gonna tail one of the things behind me okay the bite hits oh I'm gonna negate all that healing yeah [Music] 45 day oh my god okay suck on that delirium crystals is it medium no it's not me okay huge and then I got a 23 to hit the thing behind me which just splatters it all over yet yeah it just it gets launched Jupiter Jones I guess destroys two of the things are surrounding him the Caspian just the two Caspian is destroyed two of the demons and the severe expends it's legendary action to cast feeble mind on Sebastian a counterspell you can't you just counter spell this dispel magic oh that's on the same turn it's still the same turn oh man okay what do I need to do well first of all you take 18 psychic damage right away and you need to make an intelligent saving throw use everything you also have yeah I got it I got it [Music] you get nine your intellect and personality are shattered Oh No your intelligence and charisma become one you can't cast spells activate magic items understand languages or communicate in any tell intelligible way you can recognize your friends and even protect them at the end of every 30 days you can repeat the saving throw if it succeeds on your saving throw the spell ends you can also it can also be ended by greater restoration heal or wish we need you right now this oh I guess I lose concentration on the T Rexes you can still concentrate on the spell alright good Oh didn't you I basically you just see me get like blasted in the mind and I'm just standing there being like t-rex do you need to make a concentration check though because you did take 18 psychic and we and rooks communicate telepathically to the Krisha yes we need her to come and cast great a restoration on Sebastian ordering a concentration is the battles still raging yes we are trapped and surrounded by rattling 'he's down here yeah that's probably not good right no it's not I make my concentration check ok Oh double crit on the way cross this guy alright this yeah yeah this is oh man what what is it that that does it it's greater restoration or heal or wish or wish alright ok the severe X it's its turn and it is going to caste it's gonna use its action to Cass dispel magic on Pluto stop it the polymorph is dispelled Oh No hello so I'm uh I'm a regular dude again yep the demons attack you none of them hit though the other demons attack Jupiter one of them hits him for 10 damage but he's a t-rex the demons on the balcony attack the Caspian oh [ __ ] and one of the Caspian is killed and the and Leonard he carves a swinging attack on Elias Drexel Makeda and Sebastian oh no he hits allies Drexel he hits Makeda and he hit he gets a 25 again Sebastian Elias Drexel and Makeda both take 25 points of damage and so does Sebastian no Sebastian and I need a

things you say it verbally casts spells correct yes all right I cast silence on it because I'm alike how about enough of you and as a bonus yeah you have to choose at a point you have to choose an object so use the throne sure okay it's like a yeah yeah 20 feet so it's all silent around it I use my cunning action to hide behind the doors okay what about the hooded lanterns and they are gonna take shots at the super xrx okay the hooded lanterns all three of them are still alive right yes all four of them tick ball three plus lice yep so they fire shots at the severe X one of them scores of critical hits yeah but the other three don't get their shots in Elias Drexel he doesn't get his shots in but the one that crit does fifteen damage to the severe X and the severe extras' ponds by using its legendary action to cast warp creature on the hooded lanterns said verbal it is not it is a special power that's they all have to make Constitution saving throws which all of them fail and they are poisoned and they gain one level of exhaustion and they begin you tating horrifically are they they have resistance to poison your ass beast you know yeah so they don't warp but they do get it and they don't gain one level of exhaustion oh well severe exile a smart forgot about that whole just like I can't talk but I can't oh okay oh I heard learners be to Allah that's two of its legendary actions too darn good ok Sebastian does your turn do I still have fly on me you know could you guys took a short rest none of you have any flight in effect I mean if you want a potion that I I have to use literally all of my move bonus action in action to do what I want to do what do you want to do I wanted to reach Pluto and then the under step out and Makeda fly you over can I use makitas action to fly me like fly and drop me on to Pluto you would have to ready your action to cast the spell she could pick you up and fly you over I was gonna use okay my my ready to action is gonna be a quick can I quicken the Thunder step though no okay yeah yes so what do you like I am my original hope was to fly over quicken Thunder steps so that I could get out of there and then feed him a potion but yeah action if you take your potion of flying yeah and drink it you could fly over to him and then thunder step back but not heal the ocean okay um do you want to get down there yes I have fun if you need it and you can do that as a reaction can I like make eye contact with veo who's right have you a guy contacting like fall I'm gonna be like uh doctor pigeon feathers you feather follow me sure okay give it a speed to get over to to like this falling count like no yep yes okay epic and they're fine I just I turn around I look at veo I kind of like give her a little salute and I just jump off the balcony and out comes a pigeon feather and I with one hit points Sebastian wait like floats down jumps Rabb's Pluto Thunder steps using a quick and spell brings him back just outside the room and I feed him as what level are you gonna cast the Thunder step at [Music] let's do it as a fourth level spell okay and and then I feed him a superior healing potion all right I get a 16 on my Constitution saving throw for the Sabir X that is a fail what's up how do you how do you cast thunder step do you use vocal or oh in the area of silence yeah but if it's on the throne the throne isn't far enough is it far I of 10-15-20 so he was laying right outside yeah yeah okay okay that's okay we're gonna go roll with it okay so and all the little minions that are around oh yeah yeah cuz you cast yep that's clutch [Music] twenty-one damage to everything in what area okay yeah so like I think it's only the two minions and the cyber acts that are hit with that or the Me's are completely annihilated by it yeah yeah and he gets blown up I feed you a superior healing potion I'm still at one hit point but and that's what really matters ok Pluto it's your turn we have to kill this thing we're getting there yeah I know I just know I was right she Makeda touches Pluto and heals him for 20 hit points and then it's Pluto's turn I run back trail you in my arms I feed you a potion your eyes open and you just run I get up and I just start walking it at this monster that's right know when you're like okay making athletics check why don't you can teleport I can't teleport Maddy boy I

Sebastian because Langley he's done enough so I'm yeah I'm sorry Sebastian I saved you your life is yours to do with what you want I'm jacking yeah whatever uh likely to get a like a 29 to hit for Ward the 23 damage late comes in the middle of the severe X and it tears down the front of it and there's this ripping noise and then this blubber and this explosion of bile Pluto and everyone

advantage where did you go that far out get there yeah were you teleported i teleported through the doors and then I after I fed him a potion I like move okay you're still on the bottom floor you didn't even have to jump no I like I saw though because you need line-of-sight - are you teleport - you use all your movement to get to him you type you fear so you have advantage on your saving car
