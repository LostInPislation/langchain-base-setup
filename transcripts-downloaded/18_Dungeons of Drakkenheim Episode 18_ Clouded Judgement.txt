the Knights of the silver order distant Crusaders from the land of Illyria by order of the hierarch of the sacred flame have come to set up camp building a military encampment for some 200 of their soldiers the silver order has been embarking on a slow and fiery march towards temple gate when last we left our heroes they had approached the silver order in their camp and found that Commander Elias Drexel the Lord Commander of the hooded lanterns as well as his lieutenants and adopted children Petra and Ansem were there as well with a very heated meeting between the night captain of the silver order Theodora Marshall the Lord Commander of the hooded lanterns and our heroes for they were caught within the zone of truth cast by flame keeper Ophelia Reid trying to twist their words in order to keep the secrets that they had fought very hard to conceal it eventually came out that our heroes had located Queen Lenore vaughn castle the former one of the former members of the royal family of Drakon hime however our heroes were not willing to divulge the location of Lenore von castle and as a result the commander and the night captain almost decided to arrest them ganged up on ya really 180 don us that whole thing it did though it seems like where our conversation ended up our heroes have agreed that the hooded lanterns the silver order and themselves will participate in a joint assault on temple gate to wrest it from the control of the Noles and the ferocious no leader known as the lord of the feast however the hooded lanterns have barred our heroes from entering the city through their gate until they turn over Lenore von castle and it will refuse to participate in tell Lenore is delivered to them thus our heroes have agreed to this I thought we agreed to show them the Queen and let them meet yeah I feel like it's gonna be the Queen's decision where she wants to go if she's coherent enough yep well then says the Lord Commander we'll leave that up to her then okay but I assure you she will want to stay with us and she will be safest under my care if that's what the Queen wants then of course we will agree I understand that you have difficulty trusting my troops given the circumstances I'm going to in an effort to smooth a few things out between us I'm going to switch up my patrols I'm going to pull out some of my long-range Rangers and bring them back on to garrison duty and vice versa until I can be certain of who I can and cannot trust within my organization no one beyond this room is going to know that we have Leonor von Kessel located it will just be me Petra and Ansem wonderful so if that's the case that might be a really good way to find out if there is a mole because if that information never leaves this room then nobody else ever has to know if I find a mole amongst my soldiers I will be the first one to execute them cool sounds great however that consider the possibility that our enemies may be watching us in other ways I never considered that possibility until you literally just said that are they watching us right now there are magical means of being spied on do we have any places in the city that are protected and that sort of thing magical mundane there could be spies or Watchers everywhere you never know if that rat that you see is really a polymorph wizard or that squirrel just happens to be signed with someone's to we have to be very careful in these times that were not being spied on the queen of thieves is cunning and she does have eyes everywhere how can I trust you guys me yeah how am i what if I'm not even myself photos having an existential crisis right he's looking under tables and stuff for people watching him I think I let you if we can find if we can gather together we said we were meeting at the mill to show you the Queen we can figure out from there if we can get her safely throughout the city when are we going to meet you there what time is it now yeah I can't really tell here in Drakon - the next sunny day night captain speaks up y'all are welcome to stay here for a night or two if you need to rest up patch yourselves up don't worry we're going to keep you confined or anything like that thing thank you thank you that's very that's a very kind gesture from a host we won't arrest you we appreciate that but I think as soon as we've rested up we'll be on our way to go get the Queen as soon as possible so first first light of first dark of day in Drakon high yes first day of time first first-time day yeah the Lord Commander turns to the night captain and he says I'm going to stay here and the two of us will coordinate our plan of attack I imagine it'll take us three days four maybe at least for me to recall all my Rangers bring them back on in and get everyone mustered for an attack what about yourself night captain - which theater marshal replies if we're gearing up for a full frontal assault well we can be ready at a moment's notice but it would be good to have a few days to make a plan of attack maybe you've got any diagrams or schematics unlike gate and the idea is we can come up with a good plan for how we're gonna approach this situation we'll see what we can learn as well and we'll meet you at the mill say three days three days do we need three days to get the Queen to the mill well let's give us some more time just in case we run into anything we wouldn't want to be late and have them not trust us even more sure meet us there in three days on the dawn of the third day ass on the dawn of the all the zone that sounds way I think yeah yeah with that the meeting adjourns you are directed to a few tents that you may stay at here at the camp a place that you come to know is known as camp dawn as the various parties and groups depart the flame keeper philia read releases her spell and as the group's begin to disperse the hooded lanterns back to their camp she turns to you all regarding youth with her calm eyes and she says I must tell you all there's much conflict in you and these folk everybody beans well but if you feel that you can't trust anybody here I don't think you're gonna last very long lasted this long without trusting anybody nobody's given us a valid reason to trust them yet this whole place is changing and you might think that there's just us or that you only have to deal with the knot captain and the lower commander but there's more folk in Elyria that are coming there's more folk from all across this nation that are coming and in a few months or years the city ain't gonna be the same place anymore whatever's gonna happen here it's gonna happen soon change is inevitable I think our goal is to keep draggin Heim drakon Heim obviously a lot of pieces are missing and will need to be rebuilt and the people who rebuild that that's up for question but I think that we have a chance to restore the head of Drakon Heim and from there the body will heal that's a noble goal I just hope you agree you see that we agree with you all in that if you ever need anything you need some support some magic you can come to me I'll help you out we're all together in the lot noted are you coming to meet the Queen as well I'm not yes we need probably we'll need some magical support at that point and the only reason we want to take her out of where she is is because you're gonna be there I will volunteer myself as a caregiver for her if she needs help and if the Lord Commander sees fit to lock me up wherever he's gonna be keeping her I will do that as very noble of you to help our queen and we will remember that going forward thank you is there anything else you'd like to do before the evening passes as we go to our tents I do want to ask a couple questions now that we're out of earshot of all of those people - my fellow colleagues here what do you guys think of the paladins still don't like them I mixed it's confusing they they seem like they're here to help but they also have a very bad way of going about it I don't trust them and I also she seems nice but do we want to leave her with the Queen what it what happens if like the paladin's just decide to assassinate the Queen and then take over dragon hime what if the hooded lanterns are up to something other than what they say they're up to I want them she is right that we need to find out who we trust but I I have a hard time for me I feel like if we leave her with the hooded lanterns and the Paladins I wouldn't want a leader with believer with one or the other but if we can leave her with both their dislike of each other will cause them both to want to keep her alive because if either of them makes a move the other I'm I'm hoping honestly at this point we kind of have ourselves in a pickle where we have to do something or else we're gonna end up as fugitives around dragon home and I feel like if we can leave her in what we feel is a safe spot between the two and I wouldn't say public but hidden way but with a higher commander if anything happens really then that means the whole institution is corrupt we leave her at your Tower with a member of each guild watching over her who do you think yeah I agree that the paladins are but they're easy to predict I think they have a very clear goal yeah and I feel like if we we know what they want we can use that almost like a map and as long as they know we know what they want then we can kind of work around it we assume what they want I mean as far as we know they're they're telling us the truth about what they what their their intentions are yeah if they try to step further than they said they were going to if they said that they want to get to the cathedral and then back that's that's it they want to get to the cathedral to retrieve relics if that's their goal we help them do that and then they stay outside the walls or around the cathedral and in temple gate but as long as they don't move more into Drakon haim i think we're okay you know what I think - is that I think they're being truthful about their short-term game it's their long-term game I am a bit concerned about so I don't want them to really even get a foothold even concerned about them getting into the cathedral we we're told by the amethyst Academy not to let anybody gain a foothold in this city it's true but at the same time I feel like the nulls having more of a foothold is not a good thing yeah can we trust the amethyst Academy I don't know anymore we look out for each other as long as you're looking for each other and key though winging it dragon high in our opinions as much as we can and we'll do our best and yeah pika till we make it all right Strikeforce raises a big pie in the sky that we get through this alive so our course of action is winging it overall game plan to survive in this crazy City that's how we've all lived this far also to kind of piggyback on this I think we should leave in the night without them knowing because I have a feeling that they're probably going to tail us hmm okay so rests up MBI we're gonna leave right now we're gonna leave at noon and then we just bail early yeah okay so we rest up and then we head out it's like right before sunrise yeah okay like it was a long rest absolutely mm-hmm we're gonna need them to sneak out of here all of your spell's do you plan to leave before sunrise yeah okay did we get our stuff back nothing was ever taken oh yeah oh yeah we just we just yeah you can you and I it's really hard a good solid knot i untie Pluto's not just my hands so big maybe if you took your armored gloves off now oh sorry so do we want to sneak out of here yeah okay you want to sneak out unseen as if no one saw you left because there's dates we're inside the encampment yes okay we're just going out for a quick pee and then you were gone and we're I swear we're coming we just yeah let's just we'll leave but I mean there's no we don't have announcements kind of a thing we we always have to pee as a group okay you leave but he says quietly in the night the only one that sees you go is one of the Night Watch that's watching the gates over the evenings but you don't acknowledge any of the captains as you leave you can see that the hooded Lantern's encampment is has been struck as well and several the horses that were there are also gone oh they're getting ready they are preparing to do mm-hmm where's your next destination I guess we have to go get the Queen we're gonna go straight to Oscars yeah we should probably go to off now should I guess we can't go into the city right now I was gonna say do you want to bring some lilies still convinced oom we're coming in good faith nope nope okay do I still have some lilies no I think we gave the rest to yeah we're server okay Lily les delirium list man yeah we're running low on Oh trust and and and supply yeah we just bought our way into most relationships and we're running out of I know how are you now we just have to rely on our charm God so if we take a look at our map the your next destination then is to return to read manner the old manor house where the we're Oscar urine has taken up where you were back that you've gotten back there a few times it's like the second most because it is it allocation after like the PAC tower and the old mill yeah so we pull up our map it's marked at 7:00 on on your map to give you an idea of where you're at right now you're in the area of past the area of the Karen Hills so the Paladins encampment like amberwood village is several miles off this map so it's a few hours journey on foot to the city proper the pallet encampment is maybe about two three hours on foot proper from the city itself and you're able to take either Shepherds way or Market Street towards the towards Reed matter so which which route do you want to take I feel like Shepherds way is the most cleared by us yeah you haven't really headed up Market Street of course the two main ways Vale that you know to get there you have to move through a lot more of the ruined area of the city where the where there's a lot more potential activity versus taking Market Street you can kind of get a straight shot and especially if you take the the back roads yeah I think well we want to get there as fast as possible and we've already just had a rest so I think if we can book it through some of the side streets and avoid as many monsters as possible yeah and all the activity with the silver order is happening around the area of Temple Road point four on the map there is temple gate and then the grand Cathedral is marked at eleven on actually yes that is the Cathedral of Saint Patrick marked at 11 on the map so that's ultimately their their pathway that they're planning on taking whereas the hooded lanterns there are have their barracks at point nine on the map cool we can pull the map down for now as you journey across the Karen Hills along Market Street actually a route that you have not taken before but an area of the city that you're not unfamiliar with once you get close to that market Gate itself has long fallen to monstrous creatures what monstrous creatures dwell there no one really can say it's not Knowles but it hasn't been a safe entrance into the city for quite some time sounds like something to investigate later it sounds like if we really screw up the monsters that means that there's a gate that's owned by question mark and we need to figure out what that question - quest yeah that's a quest yeah in fact the other writing it down the other gates into the city champions gate which is the southernmost gate it is known that that is in the control of the followers of the falling fire the Splinter eight and because a few people had questions about this on our questions the followers of the falling fire and the silver order are the same believers in the same religion the followers of the falling fire however have become their own offshoot of the sacred flame in the years since the meteor fell so what connection exists between these two groups remains for you to investigate but they have similar beliefs the other the the Kings gate the gate on the far side of the city has not been investigated because the old part of the city and near the castle is the most state of the most dangerous areas of the city so that what is going on at that gate is completely unknown right now yeah we've never been to old town or kingsroad we've never been to the right side of Dragon I know eventually we'll get there right no maybe yeah in fact you haven't even been in the South Ward either I think that you've gone down you've taken the outside of the walls through through the spokes and the sprawl but never in that kind of the area immediately around the crater 17 episodes we've explored three roads the route most travel yeah it works it's safe in any case as you pass across the the Karen hills through Market Road this street in the heyday of Drakon Heim was one of the busiest entrance ways into the city for it was along one of the most major trade routes heading into Drakon Heim and the buildings here have weathered the ages a little bit better than the areas south of the city but many are abandoned and boarded up crumbling ruins of old shops coaching inns stables and various businesses that would cater to travelling merchants that would be coming into the city so there there were many warehouses here many ins because the merchants that we're heading into the city would say outside of Drakon Heim to avoid paying the gate tax twice so they would come into the city stay at one of the ends go in one day do all their business come back out again and then slough off the northern ward where Reed Manor lies is a area of the city that was becoming wealthier towards the end of Dragon time and there are many larger manor houses that are in the shadow of the cliff of the great castle you can still see as you approach from this way the approaching Drakon Heim by Market Street is to approach in the shadow of Castle drakon it's tall imposing spires and the reconyx sculptures that man the battlements are always eerie for they always shift position each time you look at them you've never seen those gargoyles in the same place twice it is a very imposing sight the way that it cradle it kind of perches over top of the entire city up on that high cliff as you head further into the northern cliff area of Dragan Heim towards Reid manner it's early in the morning dawn is just approaching so the light levels are very very dim you left before sunrise correct yes so at this at this point it's still the wee early hours of the morning and so there's not a lot of light it seems like it's a very overcast day as it is the clouds are a dark grey and there is a light rain that is falling as well classic dragon indeed as you approach the city there is a low rumble of some thunder that can be heard in the distance as well you come around the cul-de-sac where Reid men are lies the old building which was once a man which was month once a manor house still standing in place Oh Oh a lot of houses of burned addresses were rounding for the party you're just like please let it be there please yeah oh good and it's this rundown two-story stone house surrounded by a rusting wrought iron fence and an overgrown yard of shrubberies and brambles however as you get close you can see that many of the windows that were once boarded over the boards have blown off and have been torn down towards the inside or outside it's difficult to say from this distance but many of them have been blown out as if something came from the something happened from the outside maybe Oscars as you look up the short cobblestone pathway that leads up a short set of steps to the center double doors and the large round fountain in front of them you can see that the front doors have been knocked off their hinges and lie scattered on the ground in front of you this is fine she has a secret laboratory in the basement just because somebody broke in doesn't mean they found just getting new doors Vail that's right the mist of the haze is thicker in this area than it used to be on guard there's a bit more central dragon time here than we're used to you might want to tie a cloth on your face just in case I do I tell you thought that on my face I put my goggles on and tie a cloth around my face as well should we go in we need to go in well should we go in the front door yeah it doesn't matter at this point do we see any lights from the inside there's a flickering torch light coming from the inside in the large Great Hall type room that was off the kitchen yeah you don't all have to go in the same entrance wink wink yeah I'm thinking like if I can go in where there's no light like I'm almost invisible don't you want me to make a little bit of front door extravaganza oceans inspectors worst hello to oceans inspectors we don't like second visits either can we can we we are do we which room was the laboratory in again to get down to the laboratory below yeah there was a study round back of the building okay so we're gonna go in the front door and we're gonna potions inspectors okay turn out my drift globe okay do I remember there's windows in that room there are windows leading into that room that I can fit there yes okay and remember pork chops if you need us okay yep we're gonna be really loud hello potions inspector I sneak around the back before you start yeah so you surveil you're gonna head around the back yeah okay Sebastian and Pluto you're heading to the front door yes how are you timing this we're giving her a 10-second count a second head start ten seconds that's Eva she'll probably be waiting for them at the back door like veil you head around the side as polute oh and Sebastian walk up the front through the front doors as you step into the front foyer there's a scene of disarray as papers broken glass broken bits of cloth and perhaps even a few spatters blood are strewn about the front Laurier both the two front doors on either side of the foyer are both open leading in either direction and you can hear this low thumping noise and this growling coming from the large room to the right-hand side and as you say as you cry oceans it poses as you hear this strange it's impossible to say what it cut where it comes from it almost feels like it's coming from in your head and you hear this voice going potions potions not potions not potions meat we hear this in your mind in my grab I grab Pluto I'm gonna take out the mirror from my thieves tools kit is this door to the right is it closed it's open all the doors are open okay I push up against the wall next to that door and I'm gonna just slide the mirror over and try to peer into that room to see if I can see anything as you do so meanwhile they'll around back you look through the back windows the bookcase which rotated off the wall is open well link into the study books have been pulled off all the shelves the desk overturned the whole place is in complete disarray and you can see on the ground in the door leading into the study is a completely charred corpse based on its size can I guess who it is the flesh has almost been seared from its bones height wise it was a human eye crouched down by the windows I don't wanna make any noise until I can see what's happening because I'm expecting the guys to come through you you hear them saying the you you were saying hello hello and Sebastian as you turn your mirror around the corner you can make a self-check 9 okay it's gonna be like right there Wow okay you turn around the corner with your mirror and you see in the room are two more charred thoroughly ruined corpses bits of blood and burn marks all across the room the tables and chairs overturned the whole place is a complete mess there is garbage and rot and leftover food not rotted food because things don't rot in Drakon hydrate all strewn about and amidst all the waste is this massive mound of knobbly thick flesh it is a massive torso with three knobbly legs that look like just gigantic big toes coming off the bottom of it and the middle section of it is just a massive mountain of delirium tn there are spines growing out of its back and four limbs it has these long spindly tentacles that end in Barb's some of which are bony spines which seemed to have bits of delirium popping out of them growing off of the mouth where you would expect a nose to be is a long sinuous tentacle that is shaped like the two tentacles coming off the sides but instead of ending in spikes it is an array of eyeballs and nostrils on a long flat face it is knowing and shoveling the garbage strewn about and the bits of the corpse into its mouth it didn't notice the mirror it did not pull the mirror back you know I don't I don't even know what is in that room how big is it out like taht like it was massive is a large creature it looks like it must weigh several hundred pounds okay it's huge it's about as big as a troll you've killed one of those mm-hmm we have a choice right now it hasn't seen us apparently it didn't hear the potions inspectors they know where it doesn't care we can keep going the other way it's basically we're at flight or fright flight or fight if I move what might happen I don't know so you should I just stand not clunk clunk around right I'm trying to hold still even this up to you man do we burst into the room spells blazing swords blazing swords and spells blazing I don't have

building Nick Estelle check and I'm standing perfectly still because I'm super still come on dice 10 you walk across the room and one of the floorboards creaks loudly and that creature turns with a grunt roll furnish darn these old buildings yeah it was a better chance of you going alone it was a yell Bergdahl's yeah we gotta yell pork chops I'll I'll do it roll high come on dice handing me down you're still letting me down Mayo 1710 1018 okay yes please do I'm just gonna sit in here yeah oh it's in here alrighty so we have Pluto going first then veo then the MA then Sebastian so Martin as you turn around and creak and you just look over your shoulder to see it come around the corner this massive three-legged three tentacled horrible monster I'm not gonna lie I didn't expect when you were describing it I did not expect you to pull out an actual Minnie I was just like Monte's making it up have I now turn to make eye contact with no good Ludo your first you hear the floorboard creak and I turn around and I go and I just say run and I'm gonna stand there and I'm gonna ready in action that as soon as it comes through the doorway I'm just gonna start wailing on it nice nice okay they oh you hear this low moan and roar coming from the other side sound pork chops okay I get my feline agility out and I'm going to and you say the windows are burst open right yeah okay I hop through the window mm-hmm and I start running towards ya barrel roll like yeah and as soon as I around the corner through the door you see Sebastian and then you see the horrible monster that I just described and it's about two on its three legs real back and barrel directly towards Sebastian and I take out my longbow and I'm like not my carrot top [Laughter] and I take my dread ambusher with my three shots okay Sebastian ducks yes with my bonus action I am going to cast ever strike so I get my advantage on my first one yep [Music] 22 that is a sailing hit your arrow whistles effectively as Sebastian says pork chops but you're so fast at leaping through the room the words are no sooner out of Sebastian's mouth than veo is there and this arrow is just whistling rate past Sebastian and land just on the side of the creatures awful mountain sighs I get my extra d8 of damage from my droid ambusher I also get a d8 from Zephyr strike I'd be six from my sneak attack advantage on it Oh plus like a bunch 30 different Wow yay as the arrow whistles what are you and impacts in the creatures thick delirium riddled hide it looks like you are not using a magical weapon are you no it only took half damage okay do I notice this yep yeah okay I then take my second shot I'm gonna take one of my magical arrows a four of them left and I'm gonna use one thank goodness for magical heroes can you regain the magical arrows or once there but like could you pick it up from the monster after you kill it there they're destroyed ones used fair all right see let's see nine as the arrow whistles towards it bats it out of the air with one of its tendons and my last shot the first turn still with a magical arrow is 15 that is a hit yeah one extra point yeah and they get a plus-one to hit 25 damage extra one okay the MA lumbering forward into the room it pushes its way through the doorway which the the doorframe buckles as it lurches forward extending its tentacles towards you Sebastian you're ready to actually attacking with your spear sword the spear well actually I was thinking of attacking with a sword but because you said it was magical now what is he would've readied but I would have readied my sand my sword yeah so it's gonna be with the sword start whaling 18 to hit that is a hit for eight damage okay then now am i figuring it out that he's yes you only get a single attack on a readied okay yeah anything else though i Wang comes forward and you cut into it and it sees you and it launches out its tentacles towards both of you hello no a lot of getting a 18 against pollute oh and a 15 against Sebastian shield okay I also use shield cool and then she'll magical shoes it turns around and bites pollute oh hi getting a 19-2 hit no thanks thanks Papa Sebastian about the carrot top Junior no but my dad made his armor oh yeah yeah sure I owe him the bite syncs through your through into your flesh for 15 points of damage whoa and you need to make a constitution saving through 13 part pits of delirium flake off in your body and you are poisoned oh no by delirious Glen's right away cool next up is Sebastian so Sebastian is kind of like ducking and like clamoring on the ground and he stands up and just in a panic pulls out his wand and it's just like a web and just fires a bunch of web at the creature trying to stick them into that corner there okay we make a dexterity what's the web sound like that is cool so you're just gonna web it in the corner okay yeah that's how I picture right interesting so it's a low quality and then I buy back through this door oh okay pollute oh you are up I drop my sword and I pull out my javelin okay just start stabbing it alright you make your attacks with disadvantage for your poisoned Oh 14:14 is just enough yeah baby for ten damage and then I'm gonna do it a more do it again so that's a sixteen for another eight damage nice though hasn't yet been restrained by the webbing you take your spear out and though the Delirium is like coursing through your veins and sickening you you slam your spear into it cutting through its hide and wounding it grievously and then I'm gonna I'm gonna shield slam it back through the door I would have the web into more of the web okay go for it does I take it design yes yeah disadvantage on the ability oh that's a one okay this thing is too big to move with your weakened strength yep okay top of the round that was Bluto we go to veo all right I'm gonna take two more shots at it okay go down Beast oh six yikes nope that is not gonna do it and a crit nice okay so there it is your first shot doesn't even get through its skin at all but the second shot splits the air where the arrows embedded in the flesh and strikes true 22 damage yeah Bam Bam and then I run into the room beside here yeah just over inside the door yep so I can see how much damage 22 that leaves it whoa nice it howls out in rage and Pluto it takes us tentacle i wraps it and goes to wrap it around you getting a critical that's gonna hit I think and it is what's the spell safety see interweb 16 okay it is restrained by the web but it grabs pollute Oh picks him up with a critical hit and it throws him in the wall at Sebastian with tremendous strength Oh Stonewall shatters I around the corner to hide and then you smash through the wall onto me put the broken wall that's the coolest thing Pluto you take 14 points of damage sorry you take 22 points of damage from the critical hit as it grabs you with the tentacle and then you take another 10 points of damage as you're slammed through the wall Sebastian you can make a dexterity savings Oh dodged me 14 you take 10 damage and both of you can make Constitution saving throws is the cause of delirium 21 21 you're neither of you are stunned oh thank goodness just poisoned and thrown through a wall through I also need to remain concentrating on web yes 21 I'm I'm I'm good and bloodied okay you're also on top of me you're welcome Sebastian over to you absolutely will say you're knocked prone as well so Pluto comes smashing through the wall I was hiding behind and lands on top of me I pushed out from underneath and I looked down at your bloodied body are you okay and good all avenge you avenge me and I'm going to scorching ray the MA ma'am which will also have advantage because it is restrained now it will cause the webbing to wane flame on as well it was the aren't you immune to critical it's because your armor oh yeah yeah so you only would have taken 11 damage and what did I actually take 22 yeah so I got 11 walk back yeah that's like the wall yeah thank you yeah I get a 16 yeah 16 to hit yeah yes gonna attack it a second time stop and elven accuracy nice that one hits as well and my third 21 so that hits as well nice so you send a barrage of scorching rays are you gonna and igniting the web's igniting the web's as well fire burns burn fiend I don't know if it's actually a fiend but anyway I just want to call it a fiend you gotta remember that you're immune to those critical I do have to remember I'm forgetting 21 damage 21 damaged yes fire and any damage that it might take on it well I guess that's on its turn 86 at the tournament's shirt yep yep cool top of the round with pollute oh I'm gonna stand up dust myself off and charge the MA all righty I do a leaping lunging cool spear attack because no one throws Pluto Jackson well you didn't get away with it oh yeah here we go 19 to hit for 13 damage nice and a 19-2 hit for 10 damage so I'm just running and stabbing him all righty as you rush forward towards it stabbing wildly both your attacks land what happens it is slain oh I stab it in I I do like like a shish kebab I catch one of the tentacles and it like curls up around the Spears I Drive it through the center mass and I just kind of and I drill it into the back webbing as it like slowly shrivels up into the corner and becomes another charred corpse another notch on my spear for I am out all there's Delirium shards in me oh I remember now it hurts actually speaking of are we out of combat now yes what are you doing about this fire oh yeah fire probably can you put it out or can you only start them it's a small fire but and it isn't in the Stonewall so it isn't it's catching a little it's still burning it's finding a lot of burning to get through it's having a bit of our hard time burning through the creature itself I'm gonna search for something to like throw over it like yeah can I like run into the kitchen and like grab a like tomorrow cloth or a baby dirt no not fan it like you dirt from outside to inside I can mold earth from outside I can only move it a little bit throw like a bunch of dirt on it yeah I'll say with a bit of a combined effort some old earth and some fanning yeah it's easy I'm blowing on and then I pull out my dagger and I'm like well time to get paid and I start digging out its teeth gloves yes I did yeah I can come over and you can pull the ones over me oh yeah okay I'll hopefully no you put on some gloves and help the one area can we remove the shards of delirium from pluto's I know they as valuable as they go in it to remove them I'm gonna need a medicine check if you have your healers kit that will give you advantage what's your medicine good I mind zero I would have just stabbed him - plus one so I'm really good at giving you advice I go ow that hurts yeah oh it hurts right there oh I got a 20 22 action cool you can make a constitution saving through don't think 19 oh cool um there is still delirium in your system veo has managed to a suasion but when you take a long rest you're gonna need to make another saving throat to see if it if it still is swimming around in there is I mean I'm still poisoned you were not poisoned for now Deo is able to do enough with with her amazing she's able to do enough to kind of haze veil a sway [ __ ] but it's when you make it next make a long rest make another saving throw if you succeed it's out of your system if you fail you'll be poison again Oh groovy how many shots of delirium did we get you're able to salvage five shards of delirium good sized pieces about eight inches long out of it that was in me yeah oh that's okay we got you Thanks yeah good teamwork everybody potions inspectors worked off just as well as last time as a matter of fact I Wed somebody in this very room the first time we were here good memory memories but we need to go find the Queen yes it like this is concerning me let's don't the body's so including the are not including the monster how many bodies are there well in this way and the other in the other room it looks like there's about a dozen half a dozen sorry charred bodies all strewn about here in various stages of char I actually spend like not too much time but I'm gonna like lean over the bodies as we pass them I'm looking for I mean Oscar was a hefty guy right mmm so I'm looking for signs of burnt fats cool maybe if I make an investigation check if any of them might have been more plump than the others yeah because these might just be like lackeys that showed up 15 looking around there's bits of leather armor on some of them but you pick up one of the pieces of leather armor and you would have expected it to be charred to the body it's like the like you realize that most of these bodies were naked when they were burned and one of them has a tattoo the remnants of a tattoo that reminds you of some of the tattoos that you've seen amongst the Queen's men ah Oh God now they're attacking us naked it's even worse the Queen's men knew that we who knew that we brought the Queen here nobody who knew unless Oscars working for them should we check out the cellar yeah we should go to this the the what do we call it a lab yeah I go to the back room cool you go to the back room and you can see that the bookcase is open and the cellar door is also open let's jump to conclusions I'm sure they're just hanging out and they left the doors open um do I say we go down and we'll see if there's any signs of movement son the drift Club first is it dark it is do you know what before before you send it yeah let me go down okay cuz I can see in the dark and people with dark vision can't see me so must be nice okay let me go down and then you guys come down after yeah so I go down okay you head down there are bits of maths all strewn about strewn papers a few drops surgical tools along the pathway here as before at the base of the ladder the ladders been is still in place in fact the hallway curves to the at a ninety degree angle to a set of double doors pardon me to a set of double doors that led into Oscars workshop the doors hang open and you can see beyond the mess of Oscars lab safe to come down come down quickly quickly and I push through the broken doors I come in behind her after a moment cool stepping into Oscars lab there's a single torch that has lit that it still alights the place everything's gone the only thing that remains are his surgical tables and but the tools is potions his all chemical equipment everything is missing but his secret room didn't have a secret room that went down there's another door that goes further down the hall there are bits of blood that are scattered about but not any different than the way that you've seen it before there's no char marks or signs of struggle am i able to almost like crime scene CSI yeah yeah can I start like investigating looking for signs of like okay we think it was the Queen's men but does it look like Oscar fled or does it look like Oscar was taken make an investigation check okay put on your goggles and do something cool say something cool like I believe that Oscar in the Queen are gone oh I rolled a I rolled a 1 which is 6 hey I walk over to where his secret passage would be and I just want to like it's not really too good oh it's just a cell style door um I want to go up to it and like beautiful on the ground and see if there's any movement or blood that has led through the doors there was always a small trail of blood leading under it and it's still there it's very stained and old yes Sebastian the only thing that you can look around in in the room unlike upstairs there's no scorch marks there's no blood or combat there's things are in disarray and the furniture that remains has been knocked over or flipped over but there's not even the thing that's conspicuous that you notice is considering all the glassware and metal equipment Oscar had down here there's not a single piece of broken glass I think he I think he ran he fled he relocated why would you relocate to I say we checked maybe the rest of the area because see if there's another way out I doubt he left from upstairs this mouthing might have come because of the fight or the struggle you might be looking for the dead bodies wondering you know when the Queen tried to burn us yeah Oh what if she just went off yeah yeah true but that that doesn't I mean I was almost banking on the fact that the Queen's men got them and then we had a trail to follow but now we need we need to investigate this they are this this might be ignorant but can you sniff out the Queen like if we like if you you can you follow your nose has no extra abilities no can you follow your nose Pluto Jackie yeah I can I'm good at tracking up to a certain point like I do know the city pretty well and that's why I was an ignorant question I didn't know I have to ask thank you for Professor you don't you don't have many to Maxie and caspia do you know well we have cats like I own a cat I mean look I mean he's my friend and he's my equal what will you do next I want to continue around through the doors if possible the doors are unlocked that they are closed the padlock that was on them has been broken not not unlocked broken yep the door slides open into a t-shaped hallway directly across from you is another cell style door so it's a large wooden door with just bars like a single porthole that you can look through with bars and there's a wooden flap that covers over it that's closed then leading back the so that goes straight across and then to your right the hop of the hall veers off about 30 feet before ending in another cell style door we've never been in here before either right he only he went in yeah what if there's something there's a clue like what if he left a secret message about where he went I hope you've led we're gonna find anything because we have three days we have a cold trail to track down the Queen if we don't want to get killed by paladins and hooded lanterns if we can pull this off we need to find the Queen and bring her in three days and then never mention this whole fiasco to anybody well the fact that the Queen's men are here we might have to go back and talk to them is what if they have links on like where Oscar is or why they attacked talk to the Queen's but we've killed a lot of them but at the same time it was sport killing which is I think is totally fine yeah and I think that's very how would you call okay are we going left or right that's a great question let's do the front sport this is the door in front of us first okay this is the closest blame everything on I got the wooden panel that's in front of the door mm-hmm what do I see see beyond what this room would have been originally when this place was a manor house is very difficult to and perhaps it was once a storeroom or just the building's foundations but it has been converted into an extremely macabre chamber there are several beams upon which hooks hang from above on which are attached body parts Oscar I mean we knew he was a necromancer yeah I guess this doesn't you can see that in the room are two star two stalks in which are still bits of a body in one of the stalks and it seems like on the on the westernmost wall there seems to be an alcove with some sort of shrine inside it all around the room are various alcoves with more bits of bone or boxes or bits of body parts and other other awful essentially it looks like there was there's another set of shelves here as well that you can just see directly across from you that are completely empty - is the door to this room unlocked it is I'd like to walk into the room and I just want to check you you mentioned some empty shelves do they look recently emptied or yeah you head on into the room there are several patterns on the floor making our counter check twelve these are the faded remnants of what would have been a magic circle some kind across from you on the the shelf there are some on the empty alcove there are you can see that there a month amongst the dust it looks like there were several locked boxes that were here that were all removed and there's a fine trace of Delirium dust on the shelf around it at the west end of this room is another alcove with a shrine to some sort of creature there I approached the shrine does it look what are what are you two doing I also want to check out the shrine as well I'm gonna stand in the hallway and just wait for them to kind of look around okay just in case the other door opens er yeah okay what's on the shrine there's a small statue still in place it looks like it was built into the shrine it looks really familiar this is kind of portly looking demonic creature with a goat head and cloven hooves and bat wings I'm a biscuit demon are you home Ludo we have a demon in here oh I love demons no you don't we don't have it we haven't even statue okay yeah we have what sorry false alarm see around the statue yeah is what's is there I can read there's little house around it no any carvings and he just the statue itself and none of like no orbs and no do we know it's not holding anything hmm I touched the statue and my goal it around do you say what you what did you say before hello demon are you home oh it's you three funny seeing you here we missed your last call yeah we we had a missed connection the voice echoes out and you hear it laughing so how are things what happened here Oh your guess is as good as mine but if you really want to know the truth that's going to cost you I'll give you a delirium covered a blood-covered delirium crystal I care for not such trinkets would you like for the answer to that simple question not my soul you disappoint your bargaining that dad starts off so high with souls we don't need this demon wait I bet this demon doesn't even know what happened here I feel like this question doesn't warrant any exchange how long have you been here just a friendly conversation demon hmm that's fair I'll give you a freebie I'm a little bit of a recent addition here I don't understand how time works in your world so when you say recent are we like oh I was here a week ago or are we thinking more like 15 years ago or as I reckon the time 15 years may as be 15 minutes 15 seconds 15 millennia maybe not millennia but I'm a recent thing I can a man brought me here when he moved in can we pick you up he you could pick it up yeah it's like small enough you'd have to break it off of its carved into the altar demon if I break this statue off of the altar will you no longer be able to communicate with us you would defile one of my statues I know I want it for safekeeping no leave me here No okay why are we listening to him so by leaving you here will you answer another one of our questions we could just break you off you know you may ask as many questions as you like whether you get answers if your own worry decide can we check the other room I have one more question I want to see I want to see if your owner were to leave this place and not use the front doors is there another way that they might go what a ridiculous question I'm sorry it's hard to get a read is that a yes is that a no I'm not sure I think he's not gonna answer I always enjoy chatting with you hopefully you'll see me again Xue we'll try to get you that bone on the bone well yeah that's the other a non demon room I kick the altar that's a bad idea [Laughter] [Music] anger the demon let's go down down to the other room cuz yeah guys why is this demon keep showing up it can't be connected I keep lively following click slightly ignoring clues there's no way demons are so hard to talk to do we just need more bargaining chips actually before we leave this room do we recognize anything about the magic circle in the middle sebastien looked it over but he didn't the only thing that you do recognize is that many of these bits of torso also seemed to be former members of the Queen's men like what if her 7 the BA and it just got all backed up why is everybody that we trusts worshipping demons and summoning things and and we don't trust the paladin's but we trust all these demons summoners we've got our priorities a little bit backward I wouldn't trust them we just work closely with I'll be next yeah especially if the Queen's err I want to look quickly just kind of like circle the room and see if there's anything else that looks like it's out of place or been moved or is of any significance beyond that not much seems like there might have been some other bits of flesh hanging from the hooks most recently that might have been removed give me a perception check 26 yeah catch just a whiff of it but in the minute the smell of the dead meat you know there's a lingering smell of burnt meat and you can see that there's a little there's a few flakes of ash in the middle of the room there's a bit of crispiness to this meat hanging over here I'm not don't eat it I'm gonna swat at what I think is there like I'm looking for invisible things no just yeah just kind of around wildly I feel like they were doing maybe experiments yeah in here potentially with the Queen or potentially with Oscar I don't know but it's strange that there would be scorched bodies upstairs and scorched bodies down here hanging off these hooks but nothing in his like lab lab yeah I do one last tour around the perimeter I'm looking for any signs of like any sort of secret passages or the ceiling no let's go to the other room bye demon thanks for not eating us not that he could cool he's a statue this statue yeah right now just kick him so you only say what's the worst that could happen when you're not in a room with the demon you said it with the demon I probably did I'm a risk taker I started down the hall and like guys let's take a look at this room down here alright okay who's gonna open up I will okay you open the room and is a large another large room that would have once been the foundations of the house it seems like maybe on the far wall as the remnants of what might have been a wine rack of some kind but instead perhaps hazard cages cells four of them have been made in this room and there is a pile of coffins at the far end of the room all of them closed in several of the cells are bits of our several corpses they appear to be one of them is an elf man another a dwarf another a pair of halflings those do we recognize yeah are they the ones that we murdered the they're not the same ones no their acquaintance that's just a coincidence yeah yeah the two half things there's what you got my ears perked this used to be a wine cellar yeah but it's now a cell there's no one and the prisoners in here they're theirs they've been stripped down to loincloth only and all of them are dead come all this way and there's no wine you've got oh if you really were saving it for a celebration um I go up and I want to see if the cages are open they are not they're locked they're locked um I I want to take my hand crossbow out and I want to shoot one of the bodies I really want to make sure that yeah I was gonna sleep all right yeah open this up so I take it out in a game it may be one of the halflings I shoot okay Sebastian blue where what are you doing with us at well she does this I'm I'm curiously walking towards the coffins and probably shouldn't be as curious as I am without mentioning anything to the other two I'm like coffins okay yeah I'm watching veo shoot the halfling with our hero's bow because I was gonna poke it with a spear yeah I I'm with this this is much more intriguing are they now when you say corpses is it like they're laying down nicely or they like in a heap like were they they're sprawled and emaciated it looks like they might have starved to death I put my ear up against one of the coffins I don't know you hear it you hear chittering noise inside like there's insects inside I step away and I'm like that's not what I remember vampire is sounding like and I remember I mean I've never met a vampire but I didn't assume that they sounded like insects as you step away the lid flies off the coffin perfect oh oh no yeah big thank you to accent shield for the wonderful accessories that he has provided us you've probably seen the

heroes had delved deeply into the understructure of read manner the former fortress while sanctuary really uh Oscar urine where he was keeping Queen Lenore however the place is abandoned charred corpses everywhere and a strange statue in Oscar urines basement beside his now empty lab having headed into a prison cell our heroes have step sebastien inspected a pile of coffins one of which has now burst open stepping out of the coffin is a truly monstrous creature it has an insectoid head and body but it stands on its on two legs and then has two sets of insectoid arms that end in pincers as it lifts out of the coffin with a flash of cinders a large halberd appears in one of its pincer like hands it has these multifaceted eyes insect like an appearance and a pair of mandibles the whole thing its outer shell is black with hints of purple and green and as it lifts it way its way out of the coffin several the other coffins burst open and fiendish looking gigantic centipede out of them answering move towards all of you as they do so a voice echoes through the room thought you could sell me out to the Academy liars joke on your words it echoes through the chamber roll for initiative Oh Oscars mad at us well we got seven seven per Bale twelve well for Sebastian also twelve do you want to go first sure okay - around we didn't sell them out it didn't do me no didn't we tell them that he was the one that helped us yeah we kept him alive that's true but we definitely did we argued with the Academy to keep him alive you're welcome Oscar so Sebastian Pluto veo the centipedes go last but this creature Oh top of the wreck goes first did the voice come out of nowhere did it come out of the creature it came out of it boomed through the room okay like a PA system check testing there's no creature stands up whimper it exhales deeply from its Maw and casts a spell it casts cloud can I counter spell you can try counter spell he yells what I got a nine that is not enough to dispel to counter the cloud kill it's okay stick probably gaseous vapor emits from the creatures pores filling the room with a toxic gas that smells of chlorine and mustard it is the thick yellowy green color and it engulfs the entire room is my do you go to the top of the round now with Sebastian who you have started your turn in the cloud Gil yeah and you may make a constitution saving through good 13 okay you succeed your say but you still take happen do you vote do you need more to be actually pretty miserable that is only gonna be 18 points of poison damage but does that have that is then have so nine oh yeah cuz I was gonna say that's old soul yeah I was like didn't want to get hit with the full thing okay the fog engulfs the whole area making vision impossible that's hard which means I don't have line of sight for teleporting doing it do I correct oh well there goes my whole battle plan we can always get your body after sorry I'm trying to think there it sees oh my god this this nullifies so many things it's my turn yep oh man I'm in a pickle okay I'm I'm gonna back up a bit to push myself against Pluto Jackson okay hey and then I'm gonna web all the area in front of me there might be a centipede that might get an opportunity attack my there's a lot of they're everywhere and I hate bugs cool well you're going to cast web and everything you can see in front of you yeah okay I start backing up in a fear and screaming I juice oh my wand out and I'm like oh god stay where you are and I web okay web Annette sounds good to me I'm running low next up is Pluto let's get that Constitution say will you accept a 10 that is a failed saving oh that is going to be Wow that was four twos and the six so that is 14 points poison damage oh that hurt Pluto what's it gonna be do I feel the poison seeps through you like mustard gas even holding your breath will not help you it is searing even in your eyes can I touch do it do I do ice you can always touch I touch Sebastian you reach out towards where Sebastian is cool make a perception check I did back up towards him as well so 15 you feel him okay oh that's my butt BAE oh I'm sorry I'm you'll find a way and I'm gonna dimension door okay with you the demon room okay you appear in the demon room by you can't tell there's a cloud of smoke because it's all a bunch of smoke Shh okay super now it's your turn yep eight your loves are all that poison damage man that's gonna be 24 points of poison damage against the centipede so I'm gonna cast a zephyr strike okay so I don't get my opportunity attacks and with my feline agility I'm gonna move out of the room cool you run up to the doorway and you slam face-first into an invisible wall ow Oh No baiyoke I'm ahead of the cloud I know it's going right up to the edge of the room uh-oh veo pork chops okay and I guess I'm not going anywhere I turn around and I start taking my three shots into I guess the mist okay nobody I want to take it to wards where I thought the bigger creature was sure make all the shots with disadvantage 17 you hear ricochets it bounces off of some sort of shell okay take my second shot 11 the shot goes wide my last one oh no no no not one either and I'm like oh god I'm stuck okay the centipedes who are in the web thankfully are there any them that aren't well I'm going to kind of position the centipede so unfortunately I gave them good positioning so really only one of them is in the web one one centipede and the big guy unless you want to say that this guy's in the library we will so there's one free so the one that's free one makes it saving throat and the other they both scurry towards Vale and they attack one getting both of them hits because they have advantage because they have blind sight and you don't they you take four points of piercing damage from each and make to Constitution saving throws please cool you resist the poison of their bites you might need to rope trick oh yeah I already got that in my back pocket okay we go to the top of the round with the mez Olaf he gets a 15 16 [Music] oh yes he does oh yeah no he actually doesn't have any any oh yeah he can throw his trident so he throws his Trident at Vale getting a 23 to hit yep for eight piercing for seven piercing damage but now he doesn't have a trident so you've got that going for you top of the round with Sebastian neither of us know about the wall no nope so you see here's what you see when you come around the corner you just see veil like pressed up as she's against a pane of glass as this trident slams again against her and she cries out as it hits her and you could just see the outline of her and the the gas all swirling around and as can we hear her like normal or is it like she said it's a muffled it's like she's on the other side of the painting I don't know okay if only it was smaller if only I don't have any spell slots left for that that's defined then I very little left that I don't even know if I can interact with this wall so I run forward and I see the centipedes crawling up your legs and I don't know if this is gonna work but I'm just gonna try to fire bolt one of the centipedes cool the fire bolt sails forward collides with the invisible barrier and cannot penetrate through it Pluto blue no it's your turn what are you gonna do I'm gonna run around the corner and say my last goodbyes to veio no no Sebastian used magic you know tried that no I'm gonna yell into the abyss Oscar it wasn't us we didn't betray you please please okay anything else you'd like to do I'll do words echo ineffectually down the hall how can I make it closer to the how uh what's my 30 put me up as close as I can and I'm gonna drink a potion okay as I'm running up towards the invisible barrier cool day oh it's your turn you're still in the poison make a constitution saving from 23 you succeed so you only take half damage from the poison this is great so that's only gonna be 12 points Martin I cast rope trick and yes and I scurry up the rope into my dimension it gives us a solid hour to figure it out cool well actually two hours because I can cast it twice and I'm a wrestler is the Missoula's turn the mezzo LOF casa dispel magic on your road trip always magical all right you can be laughing so hard stop laughs this is tragic this is this is tragic it's not no it's not just Auto work can't you track it yeah the spell magic ends any spell of third level or lower does it also end the cloud kill I choose one creature object or magical effect within range can you trade in sorcery points but I don't know if and larger useful work maybe you got it zoom in there and then zoom out you can only use your cape a certain amount of times right yeah he's done he's done with cape yeah capers once I didn't think there was gonna be a wall there these centipedes don't break out but there's two that are waiting underneath for you to fall out of your tricks so there you can make an acrobatics check as you're shunted out of your rope trick cool you managed to land on your feet classic but you were once again back in the poisonous area does it reach the whole room if the the cloud kill moves away from the caster but because it's blocked by the wall the magical wall it can't move anywhere so it fills the entire room doorway can we do it on cool I was trying to think of anything like the Sebastian that's your turn okay well I'm gonna use some some sorcery points here to gain back a second level spell slot and icy veil climb up the rope into another dimension and then fall back down and start getting attacked by centipedes again I'm looking at the doorframe are there any like cracks in the wall holes in the wall like do mice come and go are there like but I couldn't make her that small though could I make veo small enough to fit through a crack in the wall that might be there I'm just trying to think outside the box here yeah yeah you have to make her very small and I can't make her that's in the wall of force is filling the wall ah we can't just start wailing on it right that was gonna be my plan yeah my my fire bolt didn't look like an effect of the wall did it yes Wood wall of force not allow the smoke to come in and affect her if you create a wall of force it will cut the cloud kill wherever it is so it will separate it but whatever gas is there will remain there so she'll still be in a bubble of gas wait so do this wall for stop spells or to a certain point right just physical skills the ground smooth rock or is it loose dirt it's rock come on I'm thinking I'm thinking of everything if you want a thunder step in there you can thunder step right to the edge you could under step on the other side of the wall I would say but that's about it but to get in that would get you in the room should we just go back if you're going in you got to take me with you we're a strike force I quickened Thunder step okay Bob okay and then now that I've done that I so I quickened thunder step there's that done and then I'm going to scorching ray at where I think the big guy is sure because I want he's also in web so that cancels that do I still get to use elven accuracy no no no 21 that hits yeah 10 that misses more than 21 okay okay nice nice like the web's up mmm 20 damage and that's gonna be hopefully to con to con saves for his spell he fails yeah now the thing is I'm gonna tell ya technically I'm only going to apply the first hit because you just quickened dispel so you're you could have fired a scorching ray right but not no no you could have fired a fire bolt but not a scorch I was to spell so roll dev so roll damage I roll the I roll didn't even roll enough to yes that's okay but yeah just so that we caught that one I got excited with I got a 9 on my concentration check so it's gonna fail regardless ok well then it was only uh it was only just straight up ed yeah 8 damage okay not 20 yeah good call Wow but still you did it so the are both spells done the know how to kill is gone grabbed is still there okay or did the web light him on fire yes the web's are now on fire that's better right maybe fire helps do the web still hold in place for like a round or two or are they gone once they're burned uh they light up I believe it a speed of 1 5 feet per round cool so we now go to Pluto Pluto seeing the new battleground and two centipedes in front of you wow that was clutch I thought I had you you can't kill the muscle I throw my god out of the woods yet I throw my javelin at the giant insect creature calling the elven lightning word for lightning whatever it is I learned it that one word ok 23 that hits and so they all gotta make DC 13 Dex saves and the five foot wide oh yeah them just run the line over where you want to hit I want to hit the the big creature with the actual javelin so anything that gets to it to centipedes and the big guy okay so you get to centipedes that are not the two that are not webbed yeah yeah they both fail their savings routes and are turning to find electrified mist so ten lightning damage nice and then the big guy takes 21 damage he only takes ten resistant the lady oh right yeah for four of those dice one wait it's a twenty damage of lightning damage and then it's one plus seven eight damage of javelin damage cool and then I'm gonna run at him and pull the javelin out of him and then stab it back in nice you make the attack with advantage nice that's better yeah come on I need that okay twenty three and four ten damage and then I'm gonna stand on top of them and start shoving my shield down his stupid insect face seven you remain standing no place so you like try to push him down he just kind of like sticks back up and that's that's all Pluto Jackson all righty now I'm not a happy kid II um I take my bow and I aim it straight at the big guy's face cool it's advantage because webbed right yeah nice right off the insect shell alright take a second shot fifteen doesn't go through it's okay that's like do I still look to centipedes there there's one centipede in the web where they're supposed to be for centipedes no there's two in the web okay they're gonna try to break one does and it rushes towards Sebastian no it's coming after you no runs by me do I got a swing can I swing out um sure yeah twenty-seven you splatter him in half yeah thirteen as you hear as it starts running to me you hear it I just pick it up go to the top it around with the mezzo la darkness no that's my only weakness no a lot the room goes black it's a lie there's also fire centered on himself yeah what about all the fire on the web's does he take some damage okay he does take six points of fire damage and he's effectively broken out of the web's come our way yeah bye web hello fire the fire is still burning on the coffins though Sebastian you're up what is this and we're still trapped it's so weird to be on the other end of this I can't even see Pluto I run up to the edge of the darkness and I'm going to use my wand and create a cone of fear so I pulled out my wand at the edge of the darkness and I yell fear me ah that's my cool line it is not affected nothing - it makes it saving - yes no the code of fear shrieks out and the mezcla the strip lies I don't Ludo you're up I can't see him no but I can guess yeah you're just a taxable head disadvantage I'm a swinging - 18 for a 25 no 26 to hit oh I find I find it for 10 and then I'm gonna swing again that's like good yeah 12 to hit yeah that misses and he maintains concentration on darkness but I'm gonna try to push them back into the fire okay go for it push eight you get the 17 he's real strong [ __ ] you were strong no you're out to get them with my bow even though it's disadvantage yeah 20 you fight you pierced the center of the darkness and this is the shot does land 17 damage I like how you're just constantly shooting and he does make in there all right I take a second shot at him nope 10 yes I'm sorry for he blew meza laughs turn yeah it rips into pollute Oh with all of its might hello making to making attacking with its lower claws and stabbing with this trident I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay it gets a 16-2 hit with the claws and a.22 hit with the Trident about that one hits ten points of piercing damage yet Trident comes back to his hands man I want that I want that now I want more choice javelin Trident your buyers kindness fire like his own like psychic power kind of hold it cool oh I'm gonna repost actually one of his cool the other centipede has oh there's a centipede in front of Sebastian yeah or no that was one that was in the web it's definitely dead though yeah it just kabob oh well they almost did some damage one over here already Sebastian you're up sir now that my wand has struck fear into his heart I will cast a fire bolt into this darkness guys can you put with disadvantage in the dark this is fine yeah I just I'm shooting into it randomly 22 to hit ya with disadvantage a that does go through BAM cuz that's how a sorcerer does that's gonna be nine damage just departed and everything and everything yeah but what about his concentration check it's good alrighty gluto you're up the drift globe is cooking around it's cooking I'd turn it on and Ike has daylight de BAM dispels the darkness and then I action surge and start just hammer I go I see you now oh I think I'm looking around frantically [Music] 20 to hit that hits for 8 damage okay and that was my last superiority dice and now I'm just cruising like 12 and I'm gonna just I'm gonna hit him again into the fire into the fire with you [Music] 18 oh you do you push him back into the flames bail you're up dying the fire which was you were born I'm a key I'm like you'll die eventually no eight four one and both the shots bouncing off of its hide you fire them just as the shield knocks him over yeah yeah I knock them out of the way okay taking its Trident it throws it stride in it they out getting a 22 hit yep it takes fire damage it does there you take 10 points of damage from that and then it rushes forward at pollute oh I only getting a 13 to hit how much fire damage to take it takes one this is everything except dying from us yeah it seems pretty resistant to that it's the bastion you're out yet alright what do you have that's not fire or lightning I mean that ok stupid question that's all we have is fire and lightning and arrows and swords and stuff we needed some acid we need some acid man tell you what I can do Pluto ah do you prefer to be bigger than everybody or do you prefer what you're fighting to be smaller than everything I'm going with you you know what you're a willing target I step back and I enlarge Pluto mega pollute okay blue top plutonomy I'm trying to say contact your doctor for enlarged contact your sorcerer for enlargements lasting more than one minute I step back and yeah I point my wallet at you I'm super big now okay and I start funneling all my childhood insecurities take this Jupiter you'll never bully me again so you have advantage on strength check strength saving throws by not attacks your attacks dealing extra 1.d4 damage here at axiory for damage I feel big all righty Pluto you're up mega Pluto back up Ludo crush little insect 19 that hit were 10 damage did you have the D for no I didn't for a 12 damage in total the d4 did it and then I pick it up with the spear and I Huck it into the fire of in coffin and it the fire just explodes into flame and its whole form turns to ash - so worth it I rush up to you die shaker Mike you saved a oh I'm so sorry I messed you to get to i teleported back in here hello I'm so sorry we left you I thought you were we were gonna have to get a new cat back really bad memories of when my chat one of my childhood cats ate rat poison and I was like oh man I'm just reliving my job we hug a hug veo oh no meet you Oscar is so boy but I actually I start yelling at ya Oscar how dare you show yourself I'm still big - we've spoiled your puzzle as you're doing this I'm chugging a healing potion like yeah yeah terrible terrible person clumsy want us using my newfound strength you said the cell doors were locked yeah should I open one of them do what you want actually I'm gonna go back go back to the what the front door is the force wall still there yes just start punching it yeah yeah yeah I'm just punching the forest wall using my super strength cool well it stays there for the next 10 minutes do I feel like eventually I got rid of it during that 10 minutes no that's not enough for short rest isn't okay really one short rest we can take one with my rope trick I is the fired done yeah it dies down it's burned through the coffins and the corpses are inanimate they're stolen Oscar I tell yellow it when I find you I'm taking your head that's not how we get him to come down here and talk unless you bring the Queen here safely are we just yelling at walls might just be yelling at walls yeah this might have been just like a voice thing that came in when I'm recording here yeah it's fine they might not even have been for us what do you know about magic like that does it know that it was us or is it anyone Lucy he's pretty specific I got kicked out of school magic just comes to me naturally I did read a few books I got hope you've read at least one book I'm reading that flows through you yes I did that's that yeah and what was your question so from a magic guy yeah if could it tell if it was us or is it like a set alarm cuz what were your scurs words he said the Academy yeah he said me they said you we sold it like but it could have been for the Queen's men correct he's probably for us it could have also been for us it could have been for anyone with my knowledge of magic yeah that's what you ask you it could have been one of those you don't know my knowledge of gossip it was probably for us oh no I answered your question I read okay the book okay you're welcome estrine you can make a investigation Jack I'm gonna investigate and nettle yeah I stare at the burnt coffins for a while getting a ate okay yeah these coffins are what it whatever whatever set this the the only thing that you know Sebastian is that there there are magic spells there are spells that can be laine as traps and the conditions under which they can go off can be very specific depending on the whims of the spell caster yeah so you must be some sort of magical trap that set off a series of events yeah that was obvious wasn't it oh it's okay you're still our guy hi I spent a lot of time pretending that I was an investigator it hasn't gone very well as a career choice although I am a bounty hunter and a potion inspector I am a potion inspector how qualified um and thanks for making me big that was you're still big actually are you no you're not okay you we punch that Walford actually after the first few seconds of you punching the wall you shrink back down didn't stop me from punching okay guys so we survived yeah we have no idea where Oscar is or where the Queen is and we have three days to get her back I think we need to find the Queen's men and and rough them out maybe even like a little Lackey or something to figure out if why they were here mm-hmm harassing Oscar why does the amethyst Academy have something to do with it because if we saw if we were the ones that sold him out to the amethyst Academy what if they were the ones that either what if River is in on something because I'm pretty sure we told them that Oscar was the one we had to use that as a bargaining chip when we screwed up the first time yeah I think you know seeing that there are queens been here dead charred probably strung up in the other room for sacrifices they would probably be a good bet to find out where he is but other than that I don't see any other evidence as to where they're gone well I have an idea okay let's ask the demon where Oscar is I also think trade our souls Oh what about remember the fighting pits no that were south of of the of the temple gate not know that the the one that's controlled by the falling fire so there was a time when they said that they had a fighting pit close by or like they had like underground is that correct rumor is is that there are some fighting pits and hideouts in the spokes yeah we associated with the Queen's man we found him out on one of the Queens yeah we could start there when we found that when uh they came to our Tower correct yeah can I see the map again yes can I read if there's any thieves can't or any symbols on him though the thieves can't and the symbols are the ones that mark where where it is yeah yeah so they would allow you to find where in the spokes these these entrances are many of them through some sewer passages that's that's one way so our best our best idea right now is that we need to go to the Queen's men to find out where Oscar and the Queen are we could check out the rest of the house like we haven't been upstairs upstairs we could just quickly just to see if there's anything else yeah any signs or any clues let's do you guys want to want to just yeah and we could sleep search it room by room and I mean we might not have time to sleep we could take a short rest yeah that's fair I could use a short rest seriously I'll take a short rest then I could use you to get down here or upstairs in the in the chart by the charred remains if I'm not gonna lie actually a short rest is not going to do much for me I might actually need a long rest yeah I know what time of day is it now now it's it's still in the morning do you guys want to let go room by room and just search for any additional clues we need something to go on yeah there's got to be some other than the Queen's men that's our only lead if there could be something else here that we're missing yeah we have daemon we have the stalks we have Oscars main lab which is like empty and the what about the what about the hooded lanterns supposedly they were giving supplies do you think they'd know we're even none the best books yeah we can't really go back and be like by the way on our way to get the Queen happen to know where Oscar is he has nothing to do well maybe they might know a secondary location for Oscar we we've gone to get the Queen leaving the hooded lanterns to plan for their attack I don't think we can return to either the paladins or the hooded lanterns without the Queen otherwise it's gonna look really bad basically as soon as we show up they're gonna be like where's the Queen and we're gonna be like we lost we've misplaced her yeah yeah but she'll turn up somewhere you know she can't just vanish ease they're always in the last place you want they're somewhere yeah okay quick let's look for clues and then Queen's been if not okay we'd like to investigate the house where would you like to start upstairs on the second floor okay in those two bedrooms in the two bedrooms the heading back upstairs through the study to the hall and then back up to the second level into the bedrooms the bedrooms have been stripped bare the clothing and the belongings that were here that you went through before are gone Oh what about the Trident the the Trident remains but it's returning nature its magical nature is is provided by the creature not inherent to it oh it is a wicked looking weapon and fiendish construction but it's not like a magic but it's it the magic it possesses is provided by it its connection to the creature or not inherit okay can you describe the way the the window said it looked like it was blown out or blown in yeah yeah investigating the windows they've been the the boarding up of the windows have been removed as it and looking at them make a perception check 18 yeah 18 no wait sorry someone him off 21 looking whether they're strong it just somebody hold them down from the inside of the outside where they're boarded up from the inside they've been pulled off from the inside and thrown and the board you were thrown outside so there's no sign on the actual boards that something broke through though everything was packed up no damage was done to the lab or like the bedrooms don't look like there was had time he knew the beds have been thrown over but many of the belongings are gone he knew that someone was coming and that's why he set a trap and that's why he was able to leave it's not like he left in a human that still means that if that if that thought process is correct then going after the Queen's men doesn't doesn't find the Queen no cuz the Queen's mimetic I think I think it goes right to the amethyst Academy I think they were the ones that really set it up I want to go outside and look for any signs of footsteps going off in directions sure you had her on the back and in the mud by the back door of the kitchen our thick wagon wheel trails their recent their recent yeah it's raining and so they're probably anywhere from yesterday earth today so they're there they're starting to fade but these wagon tracks that tractor the mud it was a wagon parked right by the back door that then left and which turn into the street the street can you track it can I track you you certainly can if anyone can it would be you it's you and you have and you are you me I go back in and I say guys there was a wagon outside and I think if we are fast enough that we can figure out where these tracks are going I need a fan prints around that like look like Oscars or the Queen's yes it looks like the wagon was being pulled by one of Oscars undead ogres oh oh girl footsteps yeah are they in debt yeah he he used undead creatures so there's the there's several footsteps around the wagons as well I [Music] so I have an edge on checks to track my few favourite enemies which is undead by the way I also yeah okay I'm going to try to track where this wagon went okay are you gonna pack up and leave now and follow the tracks now doesn't sound like we have much time to lose can we can we take you already took your shirt oh yeah we already talking cool and I say we we go on our way I'm a little drained energy wise but we can't really waste any time so let's go but just know that if we get in a fight I you have some of that deliria oh yes I do I'm also dad don't worry just gonna die I'm feeling pretty good I go I'm gonna drink up some potions got about half my spells left so okay so we follow the tracks vo leading mm-hmm and there's nothing in the in the place right like no extra potions no Scrolls after everything he cleaned up yep it's all been taken I'm worried that the amethyst Academy's in on something the Queen's men I think they just stumbled upon it yeah upon an abandoned house well we'll see you have your allegiance I don't think we should jump to conclusions Shireen was the street I'm gonna also expend one spell slot to do my removal aware awareness right and I can expend one Ranger spell slot one minute per level to sense whether any aberration celestial dragons elementals Fae fiends or undead are present within six miles because it's my favorite terrain so unfortunately for you that covers the entirety of the city the answer to that is yes no there's Undead in Dragon FeO pauses for a moment since there are monsters in the city yeah from from one end of the of the the other of dragon hime dragon is about six square miles okay total so yeah it's a in its heyday Drakon hime had a population of almost a hundred thousand people it was a large city but the reality of it is that like a city a pre-industrial city even a highly developed one on the size like it there isn't like that same kind of urban sprawl that we experienced in the modern time like we kind of take for granted how larger cities have become yeah yeah let's I guess let's tail the cart roll my survival check to track my favorite enemy yeah sixteen okay the wagon trails lead out along some of the side streets towards Market Street you follow the the muddy pet wagon path through the rain as it winds past Market Street and crosses into the sprawl we pull up our map it wheels south past Market Street towards Shepards way you continue yes it turns to Shepards way and rolls right up down Shepherds away towards the Shepherd's gate where the hooded lanterns are okay you want to approach him yes so get a bit feisty about this oops uh I walk up to the gate let's just act like we nothing's wrong we'll just walk through like we've done this a million times we were they to let Oscar through I don't know how he knows I guess he knows them well just walk through okay you walk to the gates and there's as always Shepherds gate is the the large kind of double Barbican style gateway with the two portcullises that are still in place and the trench that has been dug in front of it that is then filled with a palisade in front and as you approach one of the hooded lanterns you've seen him a few times minding mine either way he says hallo friends I have word from Commander Drexel that I'm not to let you pass there's also word from Commander Drexel that were supposed to deliver an important package to him in order to make our allegiance continue to work in order to retrieve that package we do need to enter yes I received word that if you were to say something like that to us that I was to say that you could report to him directly and he would help you into the city towards the package with an armed guard okay very good no not okay then he has to come with us and we have to tell him that we lost the Queen we don't have to tell him where we knew the Queen ones I guess we can get in city another way well I mean unless you want to try to try to track the cart well explaining to the commander that we're not tracking a car and that we know exactly where we're going what's this the herded lanterns name this this man's name you know you'd actually never gotten it from home before I feel that was rude what's your name soldier but of the other lanterns this this hooded lantern is a rather gruff looking man named Luther Hesse Heil Luther my name is Pluto Jackson Caspian prints and member of Strikeforce is that what we're calling her solstice meaning we're rolling with it Luther it is imperative to the commander's mission that we know if someone came through this gate recently with respect Prince Jackson our orders from the commander said that you would try to talk your way through this gate and that we were not to let you through under any circumstances well we don't need to go through we just need to know if somebody else came through here recently has anyone passed through this gate in the past day cuz I know you run this gate and I know you've got good eyes on you make your persuasion check Sebastian you can aid him with a successful track you will grant him advantage I got a 21 yep you have advantage I got ten says yes others have been through none of your business who they were there you can see the wagon wheels stopped but clearly proceeded through we need to get through here wanna climb a wall you have that potion now the rat's nest is right over there okay with entrance into the sewers it will go old-school right yeah well Luther it's been great catching up but you're right orders are orders I guess we'll find other means of arranging the delivery of the package thank you so much you're a good soldier for Drakon hime yep he is fine look at that I know your your you been on you're in the bit of the doghouse with the commander right now you've always seemed to be upstanding folk I hope you do okay thank you Luther Luther will do okay regardless of what barriers get put in front of us from the old guard and I walk away okay can't believe they didn't check his wagon they'd have the Queen already if they'd actually just done their jobs yeah but also would have been bad for us because then they'd have the Queen and then we would look like idiots we kind of already do look like idiots at astir oh but what if they do have the Queen and he's pulling the wool over our eyes I don't think they would like how could Oscar just walk through I guess we got to go talk to the the rat Princeton try to get passage yeah back into the city through the old the old method you guys ready for more sewers and the only other way in would be the falling fire yeah but that's I we're on a time crunch so far and if you remember the the rat prince they've all been driven out by the paladins of the silver or the right they're waiting at our is at our tower but we you know our way through can we get through we've been before bear knows the way they use the rats nests as an entry point don't they well it was the same way as we went when we saw the umber Hulk correct yeah you want to take that way back in you're saying that like there's other choices I feel like on the time crunch that's the yeah there's there's always climbing the wall mean that way leads out back at slaughter stone square we can we can maybe we can ask the fish people for help or at least can we teleport in after you've had a rest yeah yeah we've outran that thing once we do oh that's larger stone square yeah well I'm just wondering can we just teleport straight across the wall technically yes but we have to but I can only bring one other person I can teleport as well but you have to see it but like if if one of you teleports me and you teleport you like yes we would be Thunder stepping it might be a little but how far can you go with a thunder step you could teleport another top of the city walls but you wouldn't be able to teleport across because you have to see your destination I could also stand here in the gate and just teleport and see through the gate how far is it passed back today okay is 40 feet so the whole passageway of the gate is 40 feet okay and then the barracks it's self is the the kind of the palisade at the front yeah is a forty foot area and then so with the ninety feet of thunder step you'd end up ten feet away on the other side of the gate right in front of all the hood lanterns so we either do the top or we take our chances with the lanterns honestly we're we're just trying to help them I also keep in mind that I'm tired I mean we have to take a rest first we have three days but yeah I'd have to take a nappy nap before what if we just went through the sewers or do you want a delirium this and get our I don't know how these potions work I might gain the proper smell slotback I might not yeah I mean spell slots our mythical concept okay um well I I like where there's bears coming up with some good ideas here we need a we okay we can't have we did how far can you go like five hundred yes to wait till the next dawn though before you can again yeah isn't this the next dawn no he's already used it yeah what if we yes think it's something how long did it take us to get from no more than an hour it's only rumors about the other date right we could go check out the other date which one the monster D or can we tell the good Street can we teleport through a why did Oscar not go to market street gate yeah we could go over there and do it anyway sore the trail leads I mean that's not a problem we can go far enough away so you probably pick it up but we'd have to do it it's it's just a matter of what's our what's our easiest and fastest way into the city right now what if we split the difference move away from Shepards gate we you jump up on the wall you could go with veo she could help you climb down what about you and I'll teleport over that means we have to wait until tomorrow yes is there a way we can do this without having to wait until tomorrow we all climb can you climb I can climb I have a potion I'm pretty strong I can climb cuz I can climb I have I have no idea what this potion does but it says it's a potion of climbing so I have that vial of shadow I mean the city walls is dangerous yeah and you know this why is it dangerous fail in lightness there's just ready a lot of things ready to hit y'all I've never seen anything have I seen anything have we seen anything you've just always know the all across the battlements of Dragan Haim are The Gargoyle like statues and dragon like gargoyles and they have a bit of a life of their own all right Vail we have the climb we have the sewers we have the question mark gate or we go the long way around to the falling fire gate but I think that's way too far away and actually going into the city via the river you need to commandeer his boat and then contend with anything else that might happen across the river I am and the deal the only thing that as well is that state where sixes boat is you have to paddle against the current of the Grand River okay that's yeah well I still say we climb what if we convince Luther maybe you make him let us through I forgot how to do that what if we bribe him he's pretty am like well natured enough that he's probably not gonna take what if we give him something but he can't resist what if I disguise myself as Lord Commander look these two through the walls the sewers another gate there are many other ways into the city but with your friends running phew which path you choose it's going to be something we're gonna have to find out next week that's a good puzzle that was scary well this didn't go as planned guys we're gonna wrap up for tonight a very very big thank you as always to
