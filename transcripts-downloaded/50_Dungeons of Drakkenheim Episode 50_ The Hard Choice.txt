tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the Kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon heuerman caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] I'm not scared you're scared welcome back to the dungeons of Dragan hein far outside the city our heroes dream of the horrors that they witness in that unspeakable and corrupted place the dungeons deep beneath Castle Drakon where a nightmarish creature a fiend of eyes and heads floats watching over veo Sonya's adoptive father the steward of Drakon hein having witnessed the horrors that dwell below and the horrific creature bloated and gibber ring that sits upon the throne of castle dragon our heroes have retreated back to recuperate recover and prepare for another assault into the dungeons of dragon hein our heroes have leveled up to level 12 mmm-hmm have consulted with the amethyst Academy for some much-needed potions and supplies what did you guys pick up both character-wise and potion wise I picked up evasion yeah there was another level of room I did take another level of rogue and also swapped a couple spells around as well so now I've got a few new second level spells like invisibility and mirror image that's gonna be some fun and yeah we got some what potions of a potion of flying and a spear healing potion I took war caster that way I can concentrate on my spells a little bit better and we won't have any sad moments any sad trumpets going off when I try to do my epic spells or if I do fail it'll be even a sadder trumpet I also I also got a potion of flying a superior healing potion and a potion of invisibility which will work well in the anti magic fields Pluto has considered himself lucky to be among such good companions and it will hopefully translate into well-taken feet as well as a potion of superior healing invisibility and flying I'm pushing it up right now I'm lucky and I got tons of potions I'm feeling feel lucky well source a little bit of a shopping spree the amethyst Academy bringing the much need equipment they've also provided you also with two doses of aqua delirium or sorry aqua exper go yeah unless you'd like some more aqua delirium I mean I have eight potions of awkward delirium I think I'm okay but do you have aqua delirium X Y or I know el grec is very serious we've developed an improved formula hook it to my veins he offers you one potion of aqua delirium X oh boy and aqua delirium X immediately restores 1d8 levels worth of spells but it guarantees that the next 1d6 spells you cast cause a wild magic search I hope you get six eight and six and it's just nuts I want so much smiling and you can't help it I'm gonna drink that now no there's no point wait what happens if you drink that and the expert view Oh we'll find out super magic survived an invisibility I become the monster in the basement of castle track and when I do that Oh full circle are there any other preparations that you want to undertake before you set out again to Castle dragon do I risk talking to my mom there's a potential he wasting 24 hours growing a beard and uttering nonsense and my head spins around but I think it's worth the risk but your mom really gonna help us with she might know how to defeat monsters and castle Drac she might be able to give some some much-needed advice she while we panic she also like owes me on like 30 birthdays so I mean could we really waste time on it though if something happens to you you have to make this choice surgery I was just saying maybe it could help although I don't have any questions prepared what's Eldrick offers if you have any way of contacting her spirit her knowledge of worlds beyond was unparalleled amongst the Academy we this creature that you have encountered is something that only the greatest scholars may have encountered and she was one of them it's possible that she might know something in the time it took algaecide at the camera pans back to me and there's already like a circle drawn on the couch sitting in the middle and I'm like uh-huh and I'm like okay I'm watching furthermore we have also received word that Eric will be arriving shortly yes I must talk to him before we go that's it yeah I still want to get the popcorn out yeah yeah we're watching so I'm like in the middle of the camp just like not even in my tent I'm just there in the middle of the camp and again I float above I have my mom's spell book open in front of me I have some like candles lit my eyes go black and I start speaking in like Reverse and we'll see what happens okay I call your siblings over I'm like kids come watch George is there yeah there's a huge gathering of yeah people just gather around to see Sebastian do this crazy incantation sometimes he goes man you cast contact other plane is a ritual yep make an intelligent saving throw 12 that is a failure rises into the air as the energy of the spell takes hold Sebastian you take 20 points of psychic damage and you are rendered insane and can speak only gibber ish for until you finish a long rest you go to bed now yeah it's probably best if we all leave the tent and yeah it wasn't even in a tent I'm just in the mid like George's witness list he thinks he's saying that but he's really just speaking in everybody's face just like screaming and spitting and like my eyes are still pure black and my skin's really pale and I'm just like running around at one point I'm just like everybody's like eating dinner and I'm just behind them naked in a field screaming and running around in a circle we're just trying to get on with our day as well I suppose tomorrow's as good as any other day vo I think Aries gonna be here soon well well I don't want to make a bad impressions on on Erik I get you a towel I eat I eat the towel you just come in and Erik arrives later in the afternoon with a small contingent of riders from far-off lands for he is dwelt in the far city of which cross which lies outside West Omar itself he's ridden for many days but as he gets off his horse and he is announced he sees une and he comes right to embrace you Vail I rush over I'm like Eric is a very wispy man he is well now into his 60s with thinning with hair that was probably that you remember being jet black but has now gone completely silver but it's still and it's thinned out but it's still that still there he's become rather gaunt mm-hmm but he still wears the fine fine clothes of a noble station and wears a rapier at his his side and a he's kind of got this long red jacket and breeches and with kind of a gold trim around it and he said and he after and embracing he's like you've grown so much I thought you were dead yeah well there was a couple times where was a bit close there for a few years but I'm a survivor Johan and I parted ways many years ago but you were always in my thoughts I wish that things had been different and maybe you would have known to come and find me I always thought that you would have been swallowed up with whatever happened and never thought that you could have survived no one did I had other friends and family that died maybe it makes me think that others are still up there somewhere there's been a lot of death and destruction in this city but I think it's only made me who I am by being here so I know that it's it's been a hard time for a lot of people would you like to come to the kitchen I feel like you're looking a bit thin there and we can talk more certainly certainly I'm not too hungry but yeah so we can't we can okay I have like a strict motto of being Lord Commander that everyone should have a hefty meal when they're here so a hospitality is key I'd I'd heard a rumor that you were a rather accomplished sharpshooter and in my my days I fancied myself something of an archer myself and so I wanted you to have this and he produces a package and one of his his men produces a package it's passed down through the family for a while and changed hands a couple times but it's always kept me safe keep it at your side and it will warn you if you're in trouble thank you so much this this means so much to me this especially in our next next trail of our adventure were hoping to go and fight something that has only been seen in nightmares but it's to save my father I wonder I wondered what I would say to him if I ever got the chance to see him again it's been a long time things were friendly but not well they were complicated yaaaay but I hope you can save him I really do if he's been hanging on for this long he's one of the strongest souls that I know and I can't see us not getting him out without putting everything at risk I will put everything at risk to get him out Yohann might not have been a fighter or a warrior but he was one of the only man I knew who could stand up to King all her clan castle so he has something of an experience of dealing with those with strong wills yeah he was such a good guy and is still a good guy and hopefully he can you know flex that muscle sometime soon in the future again I understand that you want me to take up his badge is that the case yes if if I trust anyone with his badge it would be you is that right I mean I'm not really was a diplomat from the Vale not a citizen of West Amar's that fine is that going to be any problems not that I've heard so far and you know what I think we can use all the Allies we can get right now Drakken Heim is is not a place of traditions have definitely gone off the deep end here and we're just looking for good people who can help us bring some semblance of what this great city was before back between you and me Vale all the kingdoms across the continent are collapsing a hundred years ago it was the kingdoms in the Vale and no one's recovered since then the higher arc of this sacred flame is basically ousted of the monarchy in Illyria and the Caspian well they can't agree on who actually should be in charge they're trying to do some sort of halfway between monarchy halfway between democracy and picking up the worst elements of both they're bullheaded but I understand that there one of them is a good friend of your soul I'm good in a fight one of the best and to be honest that's who rightfully is the next in line for the monarchy here we're trying to see if we can build it back but who knows after all the dust is settled what will happen we're just trying to get it back in some semblance of order to be able to make decisions don't let the Caspian bully oh they will they will they interest in this he understand with the I remember it years and years ago it was all years and years before it ever happened that there was talk of a marriage between Caspian and the Devon castles and people were floating around the word Empire like it was something serious wouldn't surprise me if that was their aim now but they're not gonna get an empire if the city gets eaten by rats and monsters as far as I'm concerned looking out of this city all I see is an empire of ashes and that's what they want to rule over that's what they want to rule over but I think we need to take the steps forward and they're a huge ally in this and Pluto my friend piece of Caspian has been one of the most noble and strong-willed people that I know and I wouldn't do this without him is your other friend okay he says done with like a blanket hanging out of my mouth and running away from Pluto I told you to keep him in the tent people are chasing Sebastian with burns you remember Sebastian my good friend when I was young hmm some things don't change it alone sir yeah a really big mix-up with some magic he's normally way way cooler than this way cooler cool having a bit of an episode but we're getting through it yeah we're gonna try again tomorrow it'll be find I talked to my mother you think you said no you didn't yes don't let that that be your first impression of dragon please this empire bashes oh yes the with that he takes supper with you yes and the package inside contains a well-wrought magical hand crossbow and it is called first warning and it is a hand crossbow of warning so it works as a weapon of warning mm-hmm so when you when the crossbow is on your person the effects of it are as such it's not an intelligent weapon but it will subtly warn you of danger when it is on your person you have advantage on initiative roles and you cannot be surprised yes sweet it also magically awakens you if you are sleeping naturally when and you're attacked at night oh oh does it like glow or like shake when it warns you you hear a whisper it's like a whisper in the back of your mind telling you almost in your own voice your hair is kind of stand on end for a moment it like enhances that sense of caution for a brief moment I just imagine like my whole for a body going we gotta go we gotta go what was the one you use what was the warning that you had you at it you had remember the tingling you got when we were in the dungeon that one time Oh Ranger danger Ranger danger I Ranger danger senses tingling it is a magical weapon it doesn't have a bonus though to attack or damage rules cool but it will do well against enemies that haven't resistance to non-magical yes yeah yes yeah all right thank you crazy I just like sit there just like I admiring it being like your niece is haunted - it's a made of it's different for you big guy jet-black wood that well wood that's been painted jet-black and has a very slight filler silver filigree on the on the iron and it is definitely it's significantly smaller than other hand crossbows that you've had before because it actually collapses down and folds that folds away so compact so easy to use look at this such straight narrow it's perfect thank you so much I hope it keeps you safe I hope so too the rest of the evening passes with insane screams from sebastian until the evening dies down and he sleeps like a baby i don't have to take the pill do we still do the pillow i thought we were past this i thought we were too but here we are the next day comes and the only other thing i wanted is it your did you guys intend to bring the seals with you or not or just the ones that your your caring we never talked about this i mean we talked about it a lot we talked about it we never yeah yeah you're right um i don't know well people give them to us we don't have the creatures she has her stash not know and i think we just go and deal with it cuz if we have to go talk to him later but i say anybody who doesn't have a direct owner that we've given out already like i guess Lucrezia has not collected her seal we're taking her slim cool I say we bring all of them that's what your dad asked for he did but was what was the one warning we got from all wrong was like if you died on that if you die down there then no one can bring them back and get the back not even the quantities I thought she could probably only her okay if you yep that's the risk that you take because she still has her magic in effect yes that's what you're that's what your dad asked for it that's what Johann asked us to do so what do you think I trust my father but I think Pluto had a good point I worry about bringing all of them but if we can't do it with all of them then I don't know what the point to bringing any of them other than our own is then do we just go ourselves tried to defeat the beholder and then once that's dealt with we can ask more questions of your father as to why yes he's like suffering in that yeah in the if we get rid of the monster down there then I don't want more time with him yes so you're just going to bring what you have I say we bring that and I like again Lucretia's and we I guess we could bring the stewards badge to maybe give it back to him yeah Erick's yeah when you're just in case nope we can come back we can give it to Eric then so then we're leaving Sol's Jupiters and that would be it just Sol's in Jupiter's okay I said that then ring five five out of seven it feels weird maybe we should bring them all oh no it's all gonna give his back Saul give it back Saul and Jupiter will defer to you as Lord Commander oh yeah if that is what you order it's hard decision I think because this is on your father's request I think them all I mean I was gonna say I'll defer to you as well I say we yeah they oh well bring them all and then my reservations about bringing them absolutely yeah but I what do you want to do I mean what's the worst that can happen why would you say that no no bad bad seriously that's Kelly's life I was reading it off the t-shirt yeah I mean literally the worst second habit is that gets back to the Queen disease and she wants someone to go in and and just she'd find people to do it anyways yeah that is the worst that could happen that is and we're dead so I mean at that point we won't really care what exactly what's the worst thing can happen I mean but we could be watch the worst-looking yeah we'll bring them with us we're gonna bring them with us all right with that as planned Eldrick and river will use their magic to cast fly or polymorph on you as you wish to get in fly fly fly let's fly yeah okay Eldrick gathers you together and he uses a fifth level spell slots to cast fly on the three of you [Music] he says I'll hold on to the magic for at least an hour that should be long enough are we gonna have a mental connection yeah that will be in place as well how about we let you know when we're there and then you can keep holding it if it takes Martin sir less than that well I'll be in touch River and I will be in touch and watching is there anyone else you'd like in the link lauric and [Music] yeah el Rikin river will both be in in the telepathic link is there anybody else do we need I don't think so they can always communicate other people too yeah it might be chattery because I mean I love Jupiter on there but sometimes he just kind of I mean you're supposed to be off my game what do you makes funny very well yeah ever and I shall relay every relay the other information to the rest as they are here yep cool yep hi guys are you ready rose are you same yet yeah yeah I had a good good sleep okay I woke up with a pillow did you gather to leave and Eldrick finishes the spell Jupiter Jones Saul Jackson Erik Tobias crow the Laura Lee the former Lord Commander Elias drexel Petra and some all the others gather and they all say and and they all wish you well as you head off back to castle dragon they all kind of stand at attention red and the hooded lanterns salute properly the Caspian give a Caspian bow and the others God do you head off your father gives you a big hug and says don't forget the hammer oh I make sure it's in my bag and as I slowly float up into the air I looked down at all of them and I go remember everybody my name's Sebastian Crowe and I'm gonna save the world and then I fly away I just give a Caspian bow stayfresh my little dumplings which route would you like to take back into the back into Castle Drakon I'm go through my dad's Tower stewards tower might as well take the path that we know yeah okay you fly back over the high over the shattered lands around Drakken Heim flying in the air yeah there you go get the waves going you know get that wind resistance fluttering through you fly over the northern districts of Drakon Heim towards where because you can as we you know from the map the north end of the city is where the castle is and you can basically fly over the North End and right up to the castle into the stewards tower as you fly up there and approach the walls you can all roll a d6 please no three one three three four okay you fly over the walls and up the high cliffs towards the stewards tower flying carefully with the wind at your back you are able to swiftly land on the balcony of the stewards tower where vales room was and it's all three of you once you land to make a run for it or what do you do all right yeah I would book it I'm actually faster flying so I want to hover okay one inch above the ground and fly okay it is as as you approach there is a screeching as the roar of the bronze dragon is heard out and as you're heading down the stewards tower you can hear the bolts of lightning and the cry and the the keening roar of the various defenders of the castle but you've managed to slip in before they could were even aware that you were coming do we want this dragon I mean I I don't think you can fit inside the castle no Larry I don't know how you're gonna get it into the basement it has a long staircase but use em to kill the mechanical we could probably like take off its wings very dismantle bar terrific fill the bags under okay having flown up past the high spires of Castle Drakken back toward and then int through the stewards tower which is one of the towers on the outer walls did you remember the castle itself is split into two Bailey's with two GateHouse's leading in and then the keep itself so the passageway that you take goes deep underground along this roughly hewn rock passage that leads towards the keep itself and exits in the wine cellar as you head down this pathway [Music] they out you smell a familiar smell it's rat huh and did you head down the passageway you see you and brush your hand up against the walls there is about a six inch diameter bore hole in the rough stone and you can see looking down a pair of beady rat eyes looking back at you it's not a full-fledged rattling it's just a giant rat guys we have we have company um rats I go shoo shoo huh it scurries off into the darkness of the the Burrow Oh worked and where's the Burrow headed from where we ate that castle it was just a small burrow tunnel only large enough for our an actual rat and it's been born through it's broken through this passage as fashion can you mold earth and close this back up yeah I pushed the rubble with molder that's a cover the hole will just forget about that forever and problem solved oh wow that was easy yeah it'll never hold me a problem-solver do i what's the width the ground look like here is it like a rough or is it stone or is it like dirt um the ground is dirt the walls and ceiling are our stone that has been reinforced with with timber it overall it's a roughly hewn stone and dirt passageway parts of it might have at one point been a natural cavern yeah of some kind or natural opened up path holes in the earth in the earth I get down on the ground I just want to look for tracks mm-hmm to see if anything's come by here other than us there are the tracks of perhaps maybe six or seven rats not rattling Spradling rats that's strange third rats no rat links so that's not a problem well we might not know yeah and these are Drakon hime rats the bigger the the bigger ones that you have seen these ones before they're they live amongst the rattling yeah as well and they are good diggers they've made it to the castle so have we I mean they've made it everywhere in tracking hyman I don't know is this are we concerned do we think there's a rat it would be more about like if they've communed with the new demon or if they try to stop following the tracks the rats have only walked around in this passage they haven't come out either of the ends anything else we can reinforce they must have gone back in the hole probably but what the hole that we just filled in yeah can I like now that the rocks are back in place around the hole can I cast amending on it or will that there's nothing to mend yeah right mold earth would seal it Paul it's sealed yeah but they can just dig right back through it yeah exactly that's what I mean I'm like is there um I have an idea yeah we want to deter rats from coming in this way right mommy wanted to deter them from getting any further into the castle yeah um I have a deck of illusions I could put a creature in this hallway for now how long's it last that's a great question I think it lasts until it's discovered yeah it does and I'm gonna also follow suit and throw a fuzzy ball an ape and I toss a card out at random okay I love random things so you toss a card out from the deck of illusions I will just get a random card drawn from this lovely website draw cards okay tabletop cards calm for all your free tabletop card and you can tell me what what it draws it it I have to set up to draw like an ace of clubs [Music] iron golem an iron golem I throw the card down in a big old iron golem appears facing the hole that the rats had dug and they ate climbs on it now the hole is really blunt and I just look at him and I'm like watch that hole and yell at anybody that comes out and there's a puff of green smoke that comes out from the grills of this iron clad mmm this 14-foot tall suit of armor with a massive sword and shield and it breathes point of what looks like poisonous vapors it's an illusion like the like vapors go all in my face and I'm just like good you had Badwan ape into the castle there's an ape all through the kitchens and back towards the stone golems that protect the crypts so yeah we know how to do this make them wrestle woman though we have to open the doors first let's make them open the doors yeah okay I got to open the doors and then knock I have to make their wisdom savings Rose did you get AZ which they both fail yay wait are we doing both of them or the doors well if you view two on the doors - no we have multiple patches so we just keep switching badges and we do you do have to attune to the badges so we can already see you can control one of them and open the one of them and open the door we can I guess we have to open both doors to open it yep okay okay so do you do the same thing as before I have the other one wrestling we make them wrestle yeah it's probably the nicest way so heading back through the vault doors back to the stone ferryman who lets you in back past the crypts and down the stairs through the rooms where this vines stone and flesh with gemstone eyes and others looking at you as you pass down in the down the stairs what will you do hey guys that's my dad hi dad it blinks I'm back I want to see if I can use my feature of knowing my enemy I want to stare at the beholder for a minute wait are we that are we right there yet no we're not downstairs I'm gonna turn it I'm gonna drink a potion of invisibility before we head down those stairs yep I am still flying I mean if it looks at us there might be a problem but yep I mean there's no light going down the stairs right I remember was there light going down the stairs I mean I'm invisible anyways well we all have to go down there yeah should I be invisible too yeah how are you gonna see Pluto because you don't have dark vision I am just don't hold your hand so in trouble I mean at least Leiby hope the beholder close yeah I'll just look for the glowing eyes it's not like you won't be able to see it yeah I'll probably be fine I hope we should hold this and going down the stairs yeah can you help me down the stairs so the only issue though is that nobody can see anybody we spend the duration of the emotion of visibility finding each other in the darkness so you two are drinking potions of invisibility okay hold my hand first first hold my hand and then yeah okay and then you put out the lights and then no one can see is there lights in where the eyes are so you go you will have to go down another flight of stairs before you can even see okay because the there's one landing like the stairs lead down several times to several landings and then they come to one final landing and then one final set of stairs and it's not till you get to that last landing that the glow yeah kind of permeates through mm-hmm so hold hands before when we can see each other and then drink your potion and then we'll walk down should we pass without race or do you think this is good enough I think for now okay if something happens we can always run yeah okay you can always run I don't waste many small jumps second level spell slots on just scoping it out okay you're at the final landing you can hear the sound of the struggling stone and flesh statues and the soft glowing hum of the Delirium crystals as you head down the last flight of stairs the chamber opens up into the massive pillared hall thick delirium sludge fills the chamber to the height of the knee and all through this entire chamber are the grand pillars that mark the final resting places of the kings of old each pillar reaching 60 feet in height holding up the foundations of Castle dragon each pillar is carved with immaculate bas-relief statues life-size in many cases of kings queens princes rulers generals heroes all of them related to either the vaughn castles or the previous dynasties which ruled dragon high so not all buried here are on castle for the vaughn castles of only world rack and i'm for about 150 years so you go further back and you see lineages of kings whose names have been in some cases lost or stamped out to time but they ride half flesh half stone coming out as the these pillars these tendrils of thick ropey flesh wrap around the pillars and the and expand out from where the crystals of the Delirium have jetted through the walls leaking the black fluid the purple black fluid into the room there is a glow of octarine from the Delirium crystals that jut through in this chamber and all along the walls as well are the bass or these sculptures some of them writhing with life and some of them not this means that the walls and pillars are quite Klima below but the floor is not walkable floor is lava boy slab always that way the floor is delirium oh yeah the flooring this octarine sludge yeah it's a thick black color almost shot through with all the colors of the rainbow as you look down on it it in some places it bubbles and he hisses almost like it's almost like a stew with something that's disintegrating like my if more has the consistency of mud than water avoid what do you say I don't see any where are you I'm holding on to you oh gosh oh god invisibly I say to see the creature floating through the room the massive bulbous form of its central head composed of the likenesses of the kings of old dangling on thick ropey tentacles tend to stop stock like tentacles that end in heads that have a single bulbous I almost the size of a regular human head bursting out of them from your vantage point here it meanders almost aimlessly its central eye closed as it floats about the chamber and I observe it for one minute yep the three of you can all make stealth checks please because I'm flying am I still at disadvantage yeah because we're invisible do we have advantage you have advantage no it has disadvantage to see Oh oh boy what you got 28 11 okay as you size up to watch there is a small clinking of polluters armor and shield as he writes himself to watch you know you grab my arm I didn't know and then there's a low gurgling noise heard from across the room and the moaning of the heads upon it rise and volume as it begins to slowly float and Bob towards you nope right because you it you can all do one thing yes I say we scatter scatter where are we all still flying yes I say we like it knows where it heard a sound yeah but it can't see us yep okay scatter you may fly up to 60 feet into the room and then you will roll for initiative please okay put me over there oh he's in the flying stances there's another flying make sure put me um like closer to it I'm flying right out but I'm staying push your pillar okay what 60 feet that's pretty good right let me go scatter further away from me where you are where my veil behind us behind a pillar Mayo where am i right oh lucky I've never really never a smart but I'm pretty lucky wish I was both would you rather be lucky or good roll for initiative mmm Mayo you have your advantage I know Harold okay Dale 1806 Sebastian 15 [Music] butoh you'll be last I'm not really used to flying it's a totally new feeling for me and I'm yeah I'm very distracted but there is no surprise we really did it old clunk clunk over here it was a little clink clink he described it my described as a clinking oh yes do wild man can we just cause as much chaos that's the idea operation okay kill the beholder so fast just so fast all right do we know how long the flying lasts for the wire as [Music] the creature turns around first the bas-relief statues all around the room screech and screen and they reach out as their arms become elastic and grasping for word all of you they're grasping almost aimlessly at almost trying to grab whatever is there and you can even see that these grasping tendrils come out across the staircase as well and as they do so they reach out across each other and this ceiling tendrils of flesh bar the exit amazing all the views that are within 10 feet of a pillar or a wall let's make a dexterity saving through sweet wait we're in this room is not within 10 feet of them nowhere dice decks please nope nope nope no wait I choose to use my first luck point okay to turn a 7 into a 17 okay but you got 9 5 the arms reach out and they find you though you're invisible and as they grab onto as they find purchase they begin grabbing and they pull you in towards the wall the two of you are both grappled by the wall until you escape and they are holding on to you on the wall the wall it's of Pluto you managed to completely fight it off because I'm wobbling in the air because you're wobbling in the air or randomly veo it is your turn I guess I'm going to this crap what after all a acrobatics it is an action on your turn with athletics or acrobatics to escape acrobatics that yep I'm not getting it 39 you remain held fast it's two ones in a row by the way this is the dice rolls for the night this is the last episode of track and time guys we got it 250 I'm just like yeah yeah cuz you guys are both yeah basically put yourselves on the like almost on because they pulled you in and are grabbing you you're not really but it's important which side you're on so make sure that you know which site that you've been grabbed on okay but you're all still invisible so even though I can't use a legendary action to shoot anybody with an array because there's nobody to shoot because you're all invisible a question thank you can I use a bonus action to hide using my cutting action can I hide into the dirt I want to hide into the pole like me I'm just gonna come in even more just try it do you think where I just yeah make yourself check oh okay twenty-two that works oh yeah The Watcher it moves uh uh wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha it's not the sound it makes wonder me yes oh that's that makes me I'm so nervous opens its central I Oh Pluto I mean ah did it hit me so the anti magic zone continues back a hundred fifty feet so it floats towards the door where I heard you all come from and opens its eye but it sees nothing because you scattered good plans the scatter worked the scatter worked well they don't scatter porkchops um and all of you are still invisible so that actually makes it really hard for this thing to do anything yes that's what I like to hear so so you're saying there's a chance it's going to not seeing anything it is going to continue with the cone focus the direction that it is and it's gonna move it's get just gonna - really wants the stairs that's too smart for that it's not seeing anything it readies itself [Music] okay guys stay very the belgian it is your turn I mean grabbed trying to keep my mouth shut as much as possible being grabbed by all these limbs I tried to like wriggle free and just push this way okay pillars make an acrobatics or athletics check 10 you are held fast this is gonna be tough anything else you'd like to do you've got your bonus action action that you use your action but you got your bonus action no not right now okay guys things tried to grab me how are you guys doing it's weird there's so many hands once again I cannot use my legendary actions because you're all invisible and I have to be able to see you Ludo it's your turn Oh No can I can they oh describe where she is to me yes you know approximately where she is two pillars back that veil mm-hmm I'm a common and I'm going to move 60 feet can I get to veil yes you can me and I find on the other side I'm on the other side of her I assumed I just go cuz I'm trying to stay out of its vision and I'm gonna try to pull veo free okay you can't see me I see where there's ya you can't see her but you can see my clothes give me a perception check I'm mentally being like well I can't see you either can check to see if you can figure out where she is with advantage I get a 9 okay so veil got a 22 because she was trying to hide those and find her hey yo I think you're somewhere close by oh oh and Pluto starts to panic because he's been alone before and he hates being alone when his friends aren't around and was that my action to try to grab her no I just made you had you Inc interception check to find her you haven't used your action yet so you have no idea where she is and I'm at a movement um you've yeah you use 60 feet of movement for sure and I'm just gonna try to stay away from the walls as much as I can okay even though it doesn't actually matter I think it matters okay so you are not invisible you are you are still invisible cuz you haven't used an action to attack or cast a spell okay and again I can't see anybody so we can't shoot them with an eye array what kind of dance are we doing I literally until I'm off this wall this is the best option I was hoping to get someone off the wall but I was scared okay anything castle Drakon what's the plan what's the plan what's the plan what's the plan was the the don't die [Music] the walls release their grip what but a thick area and towards the on the ground there is a wave that ripples out from sludge below it's it's like a violent way of rap rashes and thrashes across but you are all high enough to avoid splashes of it's the thick liquid day oh it is your turn so I'm I'm flying them off the pillar right okay hey or do you see that where are you I can't see I'm right here and I'm gonna chewed it I'm of the illness oh my gosh you're beside me yes we all together no no no no no I can't see anyone up and I I peek out from behind the pillar mm-hmm and I with my long bow and if you want to move first away from me okay let her let her take okay yeah I'm gonna take it from here okay well I'm gonna peek out this way like okay five feet take my shots you are invisible you are currently invisible but because you're close to a delirium shard you won't have enough darkness to be naturally invisible well after you make your first shot you'll have advantage on your first shot if I move behind a pillar will that caught cast a shadow [Music] if you are wholly behind a pillar yes but as soon as you come out to shoot you will not okay that's okay so it doesn't know I'm there it does not you have a bandage on your shop switch okay I'm gonna take my my shots what are you firing with my long bow okay that is a 25 - that is a hit whoa the first shot rails past the pillars and collides with the side of its flesh sending a burst and spurt of this toxic high corn picker picker Oh firing out across the pillars yours 32 damaged yeah okay oh that's a started first blood first blood I move over to this pillar okay as you move over you trigger it's ready to action and it done buyers and irate at you what is it gonna be number seven no no I'm just gonna be no no much an array I don't make a wisdom saving current 14 that is a fail you fall unconscious for one minute and you plummet into the sludge because you take damage from the sludge you immediately awaken and I need you to make a constitution [Music] nine fail so value plummet down into the Delirium sludge taking 30 points of necrotic damage from immediately contacting it and you are now proposing as it begins to go across your fur and Cosman and cause horrific no effects Oh across you as your your skin feels like it's searing and parts of your fur are slowing on no but I'm trying not to scream out okay you are in the sludge now so you you passed out for a moment you became unconscious you fell and took the damage you woke up so it's still your turn okay I'm gonna fly up okay as you try to fly out of the sludge make a strength saving prevail in five okay you can barely you pull and pull and trying to pull yourself out of the muck but you cannot you're still stuck within it and I can't see it right now cuz I'm behind a pillar well you would have actually plummeted in the middle okay great I'm gonna take another shot okay don't get advantage on this one correct no go for it they out 1313 that is a miss we're doing great guys are here you know why you is there any way if I disengage can I disengage from the goo or no because they would failed my string no you're stuck in the in the goo can I hide in the goop by diving underneath it I mean I'm already in the goodness looking like the saddest kitten you've ever seen yep can I walk in the Guru no I'm stuck in that spot okay what is your weapon of warning telling you that I'm in trouble bebe holders turn it turns its array as it moves forward between the two pillars in front of it going directly towards Vale and as it does so it turns its array to the side so that it's not focused on her so it catches Pluto it catches me yes it does no I'm sorry as it and so Pluto your invisibility winks out oh you're flying in midair so you drop like a rock Oh make a constitution saving throat can I try to have a chance to turn away can I try to grab the walls sure you are quite far away from the wall so because I chose Elise we said I want to be a robotics check do it I'm actually super acrobatic for those of you not listening at home I got a nine you plumb it all into the sludge taking 26 points of necrotic damage and be giving a constitution saving throw yeah my favorite I get like a 24 you are not poisoned uh-huh thank you on the other hand gets shot with three iris no veo fun fun and veo I get a four a five and a seven on my I raise the slowing ray the enervation ray and the sleep ray so it fires all three of its Ray's at you with a loud keening wail and I need you to make a dexterity saving throw a constitution saving throw and a wisdom hey yo hey yo you need a dice I rolled above like a three um unsaved heroes so dexterity yeah that was ten you fail your slowed your speed is half for one minute and you can't take reactions and you can either take an action or bonus action on your turn but not both you can repeat the saving throughout the end of each of your turns to end the effect okay the next ray is the enervation ray make a constitution saving trip I'm not using anymore no 17 that is a successful state necrotic damage you have succeeded the saving throat so this is half so you okay it was gonna be 16 d8 8 d800 doing a we're taking half of whatever he does oh so you take 15 necrotic in my heart my heart and the final one is the sleep ray a wisdom saying get up and you pass it in the sledge why are you guys doing this to you I mean though I'm can you take me off those dead I'm in the I'm in it I'm in a baby I'm in a with you veo Sebastian is your turn looks like it's up told Sebastian alright staff of power don't fail me now I pull out white somebody fixed the staff of power before this fight I hold out the staff of power and I cast hold monster no wait before I do this okay I'm pointing the staff of power and I mutter some words and my hound drops from the ceiling and lands on the B holders head okay hold monster wisdom saving throw with this magic this is where I love the fact that B holders don't have legendary resistance because I get a 14 is held so I pull out the stuff I do need to do a wild magic search robots big time big money big money mazi your friend veo potted plant or potted plant roll twice plant I see I wanted to happen one of these times probably not a nice first wild magic it's gonna be 82 okay second 47 be nice just just be nice to it 82 like for the 47 oh my god these are insane good same bad insane 47 a unicorn controlled by the DM appears that within a space within 5 feet of you and that disappears a minute later and the other one has you taken an extra action immediately oh come on unicorn 1 2 3 4 5 6 extra action it's the unicorn right can we year can the unicorn fly with me can i it's not a Pegasus it's a unicorn I will then it just falls into the good actually kind of hilarious I think with the wild magic the unicorn appears as a mount that you are flying so I blow my stuff and I coin it and I'm like I will send you back to the depths and my hound appears out of a portal jumps down and lands on its head and then this beam of dark there's like a resonance cascade as the shadow fell and the Fae while both open at the same time sending both Reaper and this unicorn appearing at the same time I think or just like pops up underneath me and then what I want what I imagine this looks like when I cast cold monsters the monsters own shadow wherever it's falling like reaches up and grabs it and holds it into place so it's being held in place by its own shadows I'm pointing the staff riding a unicorn through the air as my dog drops from the ceiling and bites him if you see me it's like in the goo just like oh I can die happy now witnessing the majesty actually I can't see is so far away okay is he still invisible you're so simple now that I've cast a spell so I appear on a year economy Unicom and my thing Reapers gonna take a bite okay he gets advantage on the attack because he's on top of the tree on top of the creature [Music] 23 that is a hit hmm I'm water reversal oh my oh we're back in it we're back in it ten damaged okay it's actually an automatic crit because they beholder is paralyzed never mind it's not ten it's going to be so well I guess 10 plus 12 mm-hmm okay so just add 12 more to that incredible what an amazing turn and I can't even fire an irate at you because I'm paralyzed that's right hi big fan big fan over here yeah yeah old monster the unicorn takes its turn and the unicorn has legendary actions as well so the unicorn is going to emit its shimmering shield and you gained +2 to your AC and yeah the unicorn is like what do you want to do or - it's Charlie the Unicorn can it can it um alright so onwards Charlie Charles onwards Charles can it heal it can how far can I move I it has a speed of

like as I fly as I go by can I reach down and try to pull Vail out I turns over and right is very busy turn I just want to be I just want to do everything right now you know Pluto it's your turn you are in the delirium sludge at the start of your turn so you me you have succeeded your Constitution saving throat but you are going to take 37 points of necrotic damage oh I just rolled three tens on my d-10 and seven oh I'm pretty hurt guys but that's okay we have a unicorn we have a unicorn now is the Irate still pointing at me yes the eye is still open although actually let me double-check the beholder its incapacitated but yeah it's uh its eyes still open even though it's incapacitated and so the eye Ray's still glaring at me right yeah yeah the the the anti magic cone you're still in it am i able to swim through the sludge can I move it all through this yes you can move at half speed through the sludge I want to move behind the pillar okay and then as soon as I'm out of range does the flying kick in I yes it does and then I want to like Superman out okay but you used all your speed to get there so you need to - if you want to I do that okay make a strength saving throw oh this has got to be something I can do twenty-four out of the sludge I - and I'm gonna fly pass to the unicorn and around behind the pillar like that behind or the other behind as far as I can go staying close to the pillars but which way do you want to you want to be hiding behind the pillar in relation to the older oh that's not hiding yeah behind it the behind the pillar beside the unicorn you don't wanna save me okay I beg it looks good to me gluto that is your turn the castle Drakon one of the eyes permeating through the area opens up and fires one of the eye arrays at one of you so I'm gonna roll a d4 am I still invisible no you're definitely not no cuz you're you are in the anti-magic oh yeah you're yeah I don't think I've ever yeah yeah you're reinvested in on to say the role of d3 one two three four five six it's the unicorn so the eye ray is gonna hit Sebastian it can try and erases it is going to be the enervation ray it is one of the tendrils along the wall open that's I acquired an IRA at Sebastian it is the enervation ray make a constitution saving throw twenty-eight that is a success but you're still gonna take 15 points of necrotic ouch oh that felt gross and vayo it is your turn you are starting your turn in the sludge buck in the market okay so starting your turn in the muck is gonna be another 40 10 damage oh no that is going to be only 23 points I'll need 23 guys no kickin oh yeah oh wait no yes I um and I'm assuming I can't use my own candy - you can't dodge sludge alright I also tried to like get out of the sludge with the string k-19 you pull yourself out of the slide I know where do you want to fly Q I want to fly I mean I was I have to away from the Ray I guess behind this pillar okay and how much does a superior really potion do 40 I need that I'm gonna have that you use your action to pop up I did whoops I'm gonna just connait I Oh can I roll to undo the slow your speed would have been halved as well so yeah you need to make a saving throw against the slow it's actually don't think you V but you do have enough speed to get to there cuz that's 30 feet number 5 speed is 60 yeah okay what is it DC 16 dexterity 18 nice cool yeah cuz yeah you also can't well you were slowed you can't think actions or bonus actions so yeah okay so now that's all over walk you start walk you start I got fired a pillar I'm like oh okay the Watchers turn but I guess you can't see me now to make a saving throw against with disadvantage whose Reapers still on top of Reapers still on top of its head come on I got 12 yes guys now now this all III hold steady and then I yell out to you guys hit her with everything you've got oh it's my my turn again it is your turn I guess I moved away from me okay put my arms down so I am going to cast a fireball can I make it like can I make it so that it doesn't hit Reaper like put it underneath it you want to detonate it from below yeah yeah sure where do you want to detonate it let me like it's gonna be here okay I can't be in the magic rewrite it has to it won't affect the area of anti-magic but you know it will be lower sure it automatically fails because it's paralyzed yes it hovers so it because if beholder hovers it's just floating there like paralyzed alright so it automatically fails do I still have to do a wild magic search yes you're casting this from the staff yes okay yes indeed you do 93 and 85 mirror image or your size increases you your size increases and you become a large creature okay so I grow in size with a booming voice as I call out and there's an eruption of fire which does 26 damn baby [Music] and I'm gonna use a sorcery point on actually you know I'm not okay thirty-eight damage exactly leaves it bloody as it Rachel paralyzed still held fast by your spell pollute oh it's your turn I'm gonna fly near veo mm-hmm I'm going to miss the step behind the beholder okay I'm going to then drive Ignatius three times into its I'm gonna just start cutting off eyes okay so every attack is advantage and any hit as a critical hit because this man and I just start swinging so I get a twenty and twenty nine to hit I got twenty six to hit and a 30 to hit appearing behind this horrific creature Ignatius Blair's with Holy Light and you cut into it scoring three critical hits yay so once you started this you started and then I fell into muck so you did 32 damage that's awesome try 40 damage [Music] 46 damage and then all 37 damage no kill like overkill I just start taking off eyes and after the first swing the second swing actually gets two and then the third one I kind of just go in because I'm trying to kill eyes but then I go into deep and I kind of chop off like a third of it as you chop inside of it it ruptures and the inside of it is just filled with eyes Oh spill out and all of the eye goo bursts out and almost like a rough it's like a ruptured sack just spilling out that's been kept under pressure and it falls and bubbles and and all of this wretched disgusting fluid inside it and the eyes and skulls fall to the fall into the fluid below and are absorbed by it that's where we'll take our break and we are back from our break I want

in a miraculous turn have defeated this horrific creature that now lies gurgling as its remains are absorbed into the blackened your gooey sludge below I've never felt so much like a an underdog before undercut I never want to feel that again I'd rather just be as I was going wildly out of our hands we lost total control or at least I thought we did mm-hmm until my savior I gallop up on my flying Charles unicorn and they're bigger white says truly that was a horrific foe I'm glad that I'm able to lend your aid I will heal your wounds thanks Charles and I love you as a patch I'm really big right now Sebastian I should before I forget to tell you you're my hero my name is Sebastian crow and thank you the unicorns healing touch can heal each of you for 11 hit points remove all diseases and neutralize all poisons yay I feel better nice um the unicorn says I can take you away from this wretched place if you wish we actually need to go over to that platform this wretched place actually is my dad thank you it's mostly oh I'm so sorry you should this is a curse Jenna terrific place soon I will need to return back to the Fae wild well you are a beautiful thing so um thank you for your healing horn and don't even my dad again cakes Charles I just kind of started calling you Charles is that is that your real name no anything that actually happen you know I just don't ask questions anymore this place is so weird so what happens when my blood sugar goes down I just I see things I don't know if they're real or not yeah that was yeah I had think I had some visions like I'm pretty sure I saw you riding a unicorn mm-hmm and you got way bigger and stronger and Vail was covered in sludge yeah that never happens should we go to your father yep a bunch of us dad which gives it better as you approach the pillar you see the this final pillar the 16th pillar down here is the only that has not has not yet felt the corruption around it although you can see the fleshy tendrils nipping at the base of the pillar around it all in the platform that surrounds it the pillar has a vaguely humanoid shape that of a man trying to hold up the foundations of the castle itself and an anguish face looks up from the pillar of an anguish face of stone looks up from the pillar as you approach and it says I'm dreaming again fail what light is around here right now just the light of the Delirium glow perfect no dream dad I'm I told you I'd be back you've grown who this stuff it's that Sebastian grow it is this your Caspian your your Jackson aren't you I am sir I tried to warn you I tried to tell you all to stay away but you come come here to this cursed place you destroyed it The Watcher yet I mean Sebastian all of us was a hero I stabbed it but Sebastian really lined it up guys we're a team we all did our part we did what we do Jackyl force and we're here to help you we have brought what you asked i sensitive there's a force it's like a mind from somewhere I don't know where and through whatever is on that throne it tries to take the will the will to control the city to hold everything I am but the Stuart I don't have the power to stop it I can only was but you've brought the seals although them yes we have they are I'm so sorry you can if you press the seals against me I can take their power I can't wield it I can only hold it and stop it from using it but that might be a way that I can help you destroy that thing by doing this will this help destroy it I don't think it can be destroyed it's not a thing whatever that flash is on the throne is only like a part of it it's like it's like it's like there's more to it than I try to think and I see what I think of it I see it's like trying to draw trying to draw a box on a page it's like the part of it that's in our world it's like trying to draw trying to write on a page what the ocean looks like like it isn't all part of our world we can destroy the part of it that's here but I don't I don't know and maybe stop it but that's all we know there's a portal that goes to another world and it's upstairs destroying it where it is will that help save you if you destroy it and with the power of the seals we can keep it away we can keep it from doing more damage if what's on the throne is only a part of it then we may have to just confirm with Eldrick but it sounds like we might have to go through that rift I came here on the day it happened I ran through the city streets I shouldn't have left you but I knew I had to I ran through the castle and I saw what was happening to the king and he told me that it was too late for him and in that moment the only thing I could think to do was come down here and hold the pillar because I could see already it was finding a way to control him so he gave his last command to me and I killed him I'm here by the authority of the king and I think only by the authority of the king can I be released the old king or a new king older new but I don't think there's going to be another king we have another king but we need the seals no I know but if you put another king on that throne they're going to have to wrestle with this thing as I have even if we destroy it you're only destroying the part of it that's in this world well but it's everywhere even if deep deep down even if we go through the rift and destroy it at its at its core I don't know I can only see what's in this world I need to talk to Eldrick we need to know you talk to your mom I need to talk to my mom you shouldn't take such a risk I know I can contain it if you give me the power of this heels I can hold it steady you can destroy it close that red and forget about this cursed place forget about me with all due respect closing the rift and destroying it if that doesn't destroy all of it then what's stopping it from opening another riff ten years from now 20 years from now we're just postponing living in fear of this thing is not how I want to live especially if I have to sacrifice you to do so I would rather die fighting this thing to free you than to leave here a coward and let you do all the brave work that you've done if you go into that rift and die it's all for nothing it's all for everything for everything dad we're not just doing this for you and me we're doing this for everyone do you not even know if you can do it you destroyed that thing but it was a thing of flesh of this world there this could you could die in vain and everything that he's done could be for nothing if we're not able to get through that rift and kill whatever is on the other side he's prepared he did all this for us for you I'm not just gonna let him take the brunt of this it also sounds like he's proposing a band-aid but the wound is still is still there the the the monster that is on that throne he even said it it's not it's not just here it's somewhere else no it's it is it's a mind but that speaks with such a voice voices that I've never heard before saying things of madness of names that I can't understand of all of them horror I don't have much strength but if I could just I could stop it from coming any further I could stop it it wouldn't it wouldn't be able to open another one I wouldn't be able to come any further I can watch it guard the gate you don't have to risk your lives going into some forsaken world where there's no return I can hold it and find another way but not that way not that way we have to try I have to say they out that what he's done is Noble but you're right we can't just let them fight this thing forever especially on a hope and a whim that he can contain it that doesn't fix Drakon him we've come all this way to stop this thing from this other world now I don't know a lot about magic a lot has happened but you're right special I think he's he's playing it safe and if we had listened to him initially we wouldn't have come here I think he's trying to protect Vale so we have to go through that portal yes don't dad if I go to your death if I've learned anything though about what we can do it's that doing this alone is not going to fix anything you need a team you need a family to work with and go through this we can do it together as a family so other way than you going through that rift there must be some other way we could throw a bomb threat oh I mean yeah yeah I I wasn't gonna say throw it I was gonna say we'd go in to the raft find the source plant the box the Delirium box turn the key and get out can you close the riff when we come back if you have the seals I don't know I can try that might be the way if it's okay with you guys before we make this decision I think that we should ask Eldrick what he thinks yes and I know we don't want another day of me going insane but I could try to ask my mother I think that would be a good idea if your mom has more information about these other Plains especially about this creature and what it's done here if it's invading from another world just putting a door stop in front of it's not going to stop it this thing could have unspeakable power and it could just keep coming and just because we stopped it doesn't mean we're stopping the minions what if they escape I trust your father's powerful but very right 1020 years when will this thing open again we can't we can't sit idly by and this isn't just fairy dragon this is for the world our universe our plane okay father we've decided we can't let you do this alone we need we have resources we have people we can talk to now that we have more information but I need to know what can help you now other than giving you all the badges you want one badge we can bargain with one we'll stay with one don't let your heart cloud your judgment don't don't worry about me I don't know the only way that I can leave this pillar is by the at the king's command kitchen here right now on the throne before I can leave it the nads my goal buddy on that fool you put somebody on that's wrong this thing the things that this thing could do to them not if it's destroyed not if we go in and destroy it then we can put somebody on the throne and save you it seems like a distant dream so did seeing veil again and us getting to you right now but here we are you may be right you'll still need to destroy that thing up there well if we're we've been good at anything for the last middle but it's been destroying things so you have a good track record yeah trust me my trickster days have only just increased as time has gone on there's little that I can do to help you I'm sorry if we discuss and we figure out this is the right solution we may be back with the seals but you need to keep holding on while we I will figure this out we are talking with Eldrick Eldrick yeah yeah I don't know if you know him wizard of the amethyst Academy yes you heard the seals we have the seals here have you does my nazar ond still live a crop atop the tower yes wouldn't the dragon Oh yep he's mad isn't he he tried to kill us on her way in have you tried to control him no yet it's a thought with all the seals fly it into the throw just smash through a window there's a pretty big window in the throne room missile their gigantic was amazing if we can fly right fly it in yes it's an option I'll just keep holding on you just stay right there I'll be right back Eldrick yes so we've made it into the dungeons of castle Drakon dad says hi we have defeated the monster markable truly remarkable and we are talking to Johan right now the creature in the throne room still remains Johan seems to believe that he can help us destroy the thing on the throne but it's its roots its core will still persist you had mentioned before about the rift and possibly destroying it at its source how much knowledge do you have about planar travel and us going through that rift because I got a no is this like a there's like a 25% chance that we just get destroyed going through that rift or or are we saying that like no we can go through and we can maybe end this once and for all I just I don't know what our play is here I need a I need your guidance if your intent is to travel back through that rift there are many ways that we can close a rift seal it it's not unlike fixing up the walls but the will that keeps that rift open once destroyed will cause it to immediately collapse do you have any means of traveling between planes magically speaking such powerful magic is not unheard of but requires such resources such spells and a special artifact which can point the way back where you wish to go there is a mighty spell which some have discovered that allows them to transport themselves between worlds but you need an artifact attuned to the world in which you must wish to travel to otherwise it is impossible it is almost like a compass in the sea of chaos that is a cascade of worlds maybe your mother has an item attune to another plane it's possible the contacting my mother could give us some answers I'll aldrick it could be in the mere dimension she might have hidden it I throughout the ages of the world many have called creatures from worlds beyond many have communicated with creatures from worlds beyond some have even visited worlds beyond but very few have returned for without the means to to bring you back if you left we would need to cleave open another rift or summon find a way to summon you but your immortal mortals don't shine in the ways that fiends and Celestials and elemental creatures do in the worlds beyond we have spells that we can use to call such creatures into our world but few spells that we can use to call a mortal cast adrift upon the skeins of reality if you were to go through that rift destroy whatever creature is beyond that assuming such a thing wasn't even possible and that rift were to close behind you there might not be any way back do you think all three of us have to go through the rift we don't even know the nature of this creature you've spoken of demons and powerful ones terrible entities only are their will could create a rift like this and hold it open so what are you're proposing could be destroying Demon Lord if we destroy it and someone who is powerful enough on this side could they keep it open we would need to bring to do such a thing we would need to Archmage's Delirium supplies it would be a feat of engineering to keep a rift open like that if it's a stable rift or gateway between worlds we would need unprecedented resources is it possible to okay first question what are your thoughts on us just destroying the thing on the throne and closing the rift is that a temporary solution because Johan makes it sound like putting anybody on that throne will just cause the the essence of that beast to come back so I don't I don't see is is that that like what what were you hoping for when you sent us back in here al Jake were you hoping for us to put an end to this for good yes certainly but if there is some will keeping this rift open if we mean to put somebody on the throne they would need a kamesh red will to wrestle against it a powerful will indeed guys might have a bad idea what's your idea via he has someone who's asked us to put them on the throne I brought this up last time putting the queen of thieves on the throne and seeing what she does or what happens to her I'm just wondering if she has enough will she but her whole thing was that we were gonna go through and get mouse but what if going through and was she gonna close it afterwards does she have that power she made it sound like she did but I don't I don't know this whole thing seems fishy to me and I love fish I don't know what I don't know what the play is right now I think George could be a capable ruler but I don't think he has a place on that throne while that thing exists then we're back to the idea of destroying the thing but if we destroy it are we lost are the three of us gone forever well could Kat like how would Kat even know where Mouse is unless she can find humans on other planes what if we maybe that's the play maybe we go and get lost and we just have to find our way back I think we should talk to your mom I can try like here or we're gonna go back to camp are we prepared to do the hot tiny head first yeah you're prepared to have me running around screaming in a castle truck Nina I'm sure my dad would find it amusing you know it probably hasn't had much humor this whole time so be aware that if he does go insane he will need to take a long rest to restore sanity oh yeah where's the fusion of the area in this area we can like can we can we like fast travel back to camp oh man I mean you would you have the resources to escape once before and so yes conceivably if you wanted to leave and head back to camp and recuperate again you could do that I think we have more questions than answers yeah I just feel like tackling this throne is something that we can't just run into like we need we need to know what our play is are we going in there to kill what's on the throne are we going through the rift are we giving the badges to yo there's so many options there's so many options right now I feel like my my dad was still in a pillar right here self sacrificing in order to close this thing but I don't feel I don't feel that's the right answer it's one of the answers not the right answer but it's sacrificing ourselves any better yes he's sacrificed enough 15 years of his life holding up this pillar I would give my life to see him happy again yeah but what if what if there's no coming back from what he's like 15 years of being a pillar what if what if he's done what if then we won't know because we'll be caught on another plane and then we'll be living with mouse those we can go hang out with mouse okay be plenty of a Bluto think about I think before we make any decisions we likely need to go back and speak with your mom because she's our best resource on other worlds whether it be opening closing reps or even if we have a chance to defeat this thing okay could we make a deal with a demon no unless my mom tells me to specifically tells you to unless I say mom should I make a deal with a demon and she says yeah that's probably the best play make a deal cuz your soul is already owned by her yeah she owns your soul I mean maybe she can use her owning of my soul to pull us out I don't know are you the tied to this world maybe I don't know I gotta ask her okay we need to ask these questions write them down add it to the list should we go back and talk to her yeah yo Han a strong Johan okay well so are you guys gonna retreat completely is that your intent I mean I we don't know what to do right now so I we need information from okay so one of the options was give him the power of the seals and he'll just contain the threat yeah until forever but do we still have would have to fight what's in the throne room even if you contain two yes or we go back and talk to Sebastian's mom and figure out if we have a chance to kill this thing on the other side I wish I was like a halfway point in which we could rest and commune with your mom the clock tower yeah probably infested with rats you spent one marks expert you that we have hmm or do you just want to go killed sitting in the throne room [Music] but again Mike nobody seems to know how to kill it yeah and like so we probably have to bring back up to I just got a confirmation from Eldrick here if we kill the thing on the throne do you think it will be like the end of this all or do you think we have to kill it in in the alternate dimension this thing in the throne room is creature is an appendage of a whole yeah it is a being in its own right almost like a spore or cancer infecting our world by their malevolent will of the being that sent it it is linked intrinsically to whatever demonic forces have sent it into this world yet and as such it is an anchor for them severing that link destroying that anchor is only the first step of removing the infection but it will it'll give us time when you are wounded how do we sue that wound powerful magic but when powerful magic will not suffice you clean the wound you dress it you stitch it up cover it in a bandage and let it heal that is what has happened to our reality here we must kill destroy the infection clean the wound and then decide what the best method is to seal that wound so I I think that that sounds like we just go for the throne room if I may Sebastian yeah it is in the best interests of the amethyst Academy that we simply seal it if it is sealed if you follow through with yo.hannes plan then there will be no ruler in Drakon hymen the Caspian and the illyrians the illyrians will not be able to attack the city the Caspian will not be able to hold it and the West Mars they will have to setup a new monarchy they will not be able to control dragon high and thus they will rely on the Academy for help we could help them secure the city if the rift is sealed yes there would be no ruler here but it would allow us to continue our work we could find out the nature what this connection is we could study it we could perhaps find a way to control it build it understand where it came from we would have time he's saying that just a Sebastian right yeah I recognize that your friend veo has an emotional connection to Johann Eisner as her adopted father but certainly going through that rift unprepared without resources it could be suicide in my estimation we could fulfill all our objectives with that option and it is an available option too consider it so what do we do we need to go back and talk to your mother Sebastian do we have the time to go back I don't know I think if if I had to hazard a guess the only way we're gonna defeat that thing because it seems like no matter what we have to defeat it we can't do it just the three of us I think we need everybody's help and we might put some people's lives in danger but we can't let this thing continue in the in the castle if we go through that rift we might we might just I mean like where is that going to take us we have no idea what we're in for no we might just die and then nothing gets solved or we might save everyone you might but like that's we have no idea and that's one of my concerns was that this could be all in vain because if there's the safe play with bears dad sealing it but it doesn't rid the city it's the band-aid I think we need to go all or nothing it means everything ever spied just know that George is George sitting on the throne is just not an option anymore well not until we can is that not what but even if we put him on without going through and killing this thing and you'll just he'll have to fight it his whole life any time he sits on that throne he has to fight this thing going up a demon lord sorry can we take on a demon lord I mean I mean if it's like any other statue telekinesis it into things a little bit different maybe this is your opportunity Sebastian - we could go find mouse we go through a portal into the unknown we kill a random demon lord we kill it blow everything up they seal the gate behind us and then you just teleport us back with your magic do you do your proof and where there doesn't quite work that way I don't really know how magic works what's hanging out right now are you guys still up the pills or maybe we're calmly walking back through the wine cellar or no talking out loud talking out loud in I don't like I don't like not knowing that I can't do something I'm I don't so like I'm I'm just like I don't like the idea of defaulting to not not trying to save my dad and just and I turn to him and I just say like sending you off to your death without doing anything without asking questions without trying like me dollar holds it back for 50 years and maybe the the scourge doesn't get any further but like then it's totally out of our hands we're just passing the buck we have a chance to end it all or at least blow up a lot of things I've been getting conflicting messages from the amethyst Academy guys what's why who said that I was told I was told to make sure that George sat on the throne but you're the Archmage no no that was what I was originally told and now I'm starting to think that they want me to have nobody on the throne so that I don't know I'm confused I say let's go talk to your mom look plans change but what we wanted was to fix Jacqueline I feel like that's been mission number Oh uno could we could we mmm thought thought could we band-aid it up and then try to figure out some sort of way to fight it while it's a limb chopped off yes compassing we're out of options if we just closed it that way I'm sure there's another way that we can figure out how to get my dad out there's got to be but if we do the thing we give up the seals so we never have the opportunity to like the throat is lost where the seal is always around could there be more seals can be amethyst Academy help Bo with creating new seals is the throne lost if we like either way like if we don't go through the portal if we just fight it in the throne room nobody can sit on the throne if we go through the portal and destroy it then somebody can sit on the throne but if we give the badge I like I'm getting confused so this is the way I've understood it we can seal it which stops it from spreading hopefully right we can sit on thorn no one can apps because it stays there down an iron well we kill it on this side but then whoever gets put on the throne has to do what the king dealt with like every day forever that's to deal with what you are don't ya think he's they've got to fight it and if they don't have the will to do it which I don't think George would or that sort isn't hold enough to sit on the throne no even then it would maybe be me oh gosh I don't know if I I'm pretty lucky though I think we can figure it out so whoever takes the throne has to fight back this thing or we go through the portal and not kill the appendage we kill the source and then that way it's not the appendage it's like we kill everything and then they the throne has a chance to be restored do you only other thing I'm thinking is again this is widely out of left field but could the queen of themes have a will that could fight this while we try to destroy it like kill the appendage sit on the throne we go through the portal that makes me super nervous yeah it makes me nervous okay scrap that idea that means our lives like that's powerful wizard sorcerer magic lady could she help I mean the Academy needs all these resources built really could she help oh no I didn't want to give her the throne I'm gonna hand her the throne is she laughing behind me is she right behind me okay oh man should I talk to my mom yeah you have to because honestly we need to make a big decision if we're kind of circling around this thing if I'm gonna set my dad's life on this like I'd rather go home at the end of the day I trust my mom more than I trust aldrick so okay don't wanna mean you tell him no I'm saying that out loud okay okay let's go out back and hope you don't go crazy again how much we go back okay okay bye dad love you love you soon mr. Bao's dad will be all d600 three eight five four okay using your established methods you are able to exit castle dragon through your original methods and head back to safety returning back to the camp later that in the late afternoon there is a contingent outside of RAM attract new tents bearing the symbols of the falling fire Oh Lucretia yeah yeah yes Wow they can't hear fast and as you are welcomed back to camp who Eldrick has already relayed updates of what has happened to the rest of elite to the other leaders and as you gather to discuss again Lucretia Mathias is part of the conversation it's good to see you I have heard of this situation the deep corruption that is in castle it is deep in far-reaching the sacred flame is meant to hold back such forces the solution to me is very clear the Boy George is young you are concerned of his will and protection but we could offer him now at his young age to take the sacrament of falling fire emboldened and empowered by the flame he would be a true seal against the darkness he's too young to take the throne Saul Saul Jackson speaks up under Westham our law but not under caspian law well luckily were in Westham are Anandi Nastya sir this is so messy and once he's on the throne then it doesn't matter anymore does it it does because we're in Westham our once he's on the throne and is the king he is the law and then he could release your father veil I mean that's fine cool let's get him on the throne I still feel like I want to go talk to my mom but Pluto what do you think I think that if George wants to perform the ritual that he needs to decide that for himself but I saw what it did to Ignatius the when the soul when the body died the way it transformed she's done something she's on another level of like whoa she didn't make gold delirium anti delirium and Mike and I've never I've never seen anything like that it's like when it comes to fighting things from other worlds I I have to defer to the the smartest ones in the room so are you certain that that's a good idea it says speaks up huldrych it whatever your process is Lucretia Mathias there's some kind of say it's holy magic fine but that will still be delirium in his chest delirium which has come from these other worlds are you certain that in doing so you won't actually be making him an perfect conduit for whatever this hellish will is well they said and again not very magical and Lucrezia speaks up and her followers in the room there's a sudden outpour of arguing as as the as River albick and Lucretia begin having this arc a no theological discussion about the nature of reality I remember when what Lucretia said about the magic when it first came to this world and how they have to use that dark magic against the darkness but she said it more eloquently and probably used way bigger words but that was the gist of it it was like it found its way here and we used it to fight back right but do you think even with delirium in his chest that he's gonna have a strong enough will to fight this thing first he's got to survive the delirium and the Giles will have his own wheel and I will be at his side his counsel you gonna come in you're gonna come into the castle yes we all go in we kill this thing he sits on the throne he's got delirium in his chest we go through a portal to the unknown we blow up and kill big whatever is attached to the appendage that we just murdered we end it all it's not it's not the play I don't know it sounded good when you said it man I was starting to believe you things that's it the only thing is we're going the unknown but like I came here and I went into the unknown and I got all my friends killed by rats when you kicked a horse and it was all good so I feel like with you guys by my side I feel invincible I Got News for you we're not well up until now we are and you wrote a unicorn like a minute ago so I don't know what's going on but I I trust the unicorn man me you I believe that we can go through this portal together Dragonforce and I believe we can get out if you have plan to go through that bull you'll need to leave the seals behind on the side no way that we could if you go and fail there's no way that we can even ever get them back they would be lost to us forever did they teleport to between dimensions or no guess on the same plane muster back to the Queen it's all taped up see if it still transports back to the Queen it's not lost yeah possible but not guaranteed gives it's possible her magic is that strong but even I had that bird that means that we she has everything if you fail she would have all the cards in her hands if if we go through the rift I mean the the plan was to blow up the bomb on whatever creature is in there I I don't need my staff what if it likes delirium just make it super just be like worst case Ontario we throw the bomb give it super powers close it you storm off call my mom all right I think we need an evening to think about this so let's go after our respective things and I'm already back I'm already back him out of the room me like I killed him I kill the multi-faced I think argument and at the brutal decision facing them clearly between the various factions and their bickering it will be it will need to be a decision made by the three of you to sway them over let's go talk to your mom you guys come into the tent I've already made my legs my circle and I'm like ha huffing and puffing around the room just like throwing stuff around like getting ready for the spell mumbling to myself about how ridiculous of a situation we found ourselves in and how I was just a it was just a poor boy just just trying to go learn some magic and come back to town to help some people out and here we are just let's just battle demons and control Thrones I feel passion I'm sad eating popcorn right now all right just wanting to say my dad do you think like like taking a hammer and chiseling him out of the statue would help maybe at this bullying on your dad just pulling him out of the pool I feel like no matter what situation like so many people are gonna be mad so many people are gonna be happy either way we're probably gonna die like I mean less death probably if we give my dad the seals but then he's guaranteed to die how can I just do that how can I just after years of surviving for him finding him just give him up like that cuz maybe you survived for you or for Drakon hime know yeah I survived finding him but is it worth sacrificing the three of us for him yourself and your two friends and all that we've done here raising the ranks you're the Lord Commander ranks mean nothing he's my family he saved me and he is willing to save the world but he's not saving the world he's he's giving us time to figure out we might live our lives in peace but we're not setting up our future generations this is not a world I want George to drop just because we sever the limb doesn't mean that it's over that's why we got to go through that portal okay calling call your mom all right dialer up huh I sit in the circle I pull out the buck and I attempt to commune with my mother to talk to your mom dad you can't give your luck points okay I go crazy for a while shove a pillow in your face someone go to sleep so that way yeah we gotta bring y'all make this decision with our talking door it's gonna take days the next day comes and as you wake up in the morning and as you take a Brewster for breakfast another as you are taking your meal a hooded Lantern sits down beside the three of you stop taking overdue dancers I swear I'm still kind of going off I mean I was a little groggy but he yeah i've been insane like a few times this week it's just it is what it is okay so before you get too far in ah so your little spouse it's a fun spell but if you were just a little bit smarter you might be able to avoid going insane but how can you help us I mean it's a great spell I cast it every morning myself hey what is that why you're so cute alright easy there's lots event of entities to talk to sages demons angels more well depends on who's number you've got but in any case the word is that your father might have some seek some ability to help us out I think he's gone mad personally and I think that what he's proposing is utterly crazy and won't work I'm listening [Music] I will meet you at castle dragon I will bring my best I will fight that creature with you and destroy it with you bring the seals and you three lies and deceit and a few others of my choosing will wear the seals and give me the crown I know you want to go through that rift on some side of some kind of suicide mission it doesn't have to be suicide but we can get Mouse back we can bring her back and then your my nephew yeah regardless of what Lucretia Mathias says mine if he was just a boy and he doesn't need to bear that kind of curse I will bear it [Music] I will bear that curse if it means I have that wrong and I'm ready to do it what of the planer creature you intend to fight it for the rest of your time I'm a thief not a fool and if there's one thing I know how to do its a wriggle my way out of a trap situation she's right George's and maybe maybe with the creature Matthias's help and maybe with a delirium in his chest maybe but I just just beat but is maybe enough there's too many maybes so this whole thing is maybes it's all maybes what do you intend to do with the throne why do you want the throne so badly especially coming with this curse what's in it for you there's always a price to power but what power the the the the castle the we're handing over the keys to Westham our I'd add a little secret demons like deals and I happen to be a master of double-dealing if I'm on the throne I think we might be able to swindle a demon out Sebastian just start solving the crease so just from the regular handle the amount of decisions being laid before me right now I'm just like it's frustration oh why is so right like I hate that she's so right right now you do what guys let's just let's just drop your mom whatever and just leave Drakken hime is that it is that option for throwing up your arms please do us all a favor and throw the seals up in the air so I can get them back yeah you can just go ahead with this i'ma take you have your fingers and get them back if you want listen I'm willing to help you fight that thing none of my men are gonna be able to do it I can't do it on my own but all of us together can destroy that thing in the throne room we can work together we can make everything right track and I'm will be mined and you'll be safe and you'll kill the rats and you'll it's not good kill the rats we got a big mess to clean up anyways I hope you understand that know that just because we have the throne and this roof seal doesn't mean the wrappings are gonna go away doesn't mean the Delirium that's already here is gonna go away or the monsters that are already here gonna go away if you want to correct those things you need somebody on the throne with the will to fix them that's me and from where I'm standing I don't think you have many other options well why then do I not trust you all the time and I'm kind of shaking right now at how scared I am at the proposition of putting you on that throne like I don't think you've given me any reason to trust what do you think Sebastian are we I haven't and you should be because I'm going to make a new world Oh would you say guys I don't I don't see a good option I see a hard choice can we talk to your mom yeah I mean II tried I need to go talk to her think about it like all my last turns she lets go you shake them out of it just like food coma go on just if we go go eat apples go go eat apples go I go back and I sit down in the circle again and I'm gonna commune with my mom angrily eating popcorn this time through these stages 13 you go insane I try again there's no come on we're like 48 hours still not ready yet like what is he doing in there one of these dices to roll above a ten just any of them okay so it's been what that was three it's been three days of just I do it on the fourth day on the fourth day of dawn so the connection is waiting Sebastian so like Sebastian again has like a full beard he's he looks so tired so I had to take 66 psychic damage as well so like like blood is coming out your nose and you're yeah Australis and like your eyes are bloodshot and like your skin's gone like white is peeling off and flex yes like you have a throbbing headache I make it I I can't okay like nine towels I've eaten nothing but towels three days I tried to feed you popcorn but you didn't want it and then flew away point he was trying to eat dirt I did eat dirt I didn't just try that's the other food group yeah might see her like caked in dirt and blood and mud and I finally appear before my mother I don't even know anymore I don't know any more questions I've just spent five days for I don't it's been a century been an eel it's been an age please raise your answer in the form of a question mom's like the blinks mom you can ask five questions what do I do it's not - if that's too loaded if a question hold on let me rephrase that can she read my mind can can we like she can only answer what you say can I like us can I like okay I start by recalling the entire tale of everything that happened hassled wracking I tell her the tale of the dungeons of Drakon hi and as i come to a close of the options presented putting the queen of thieves on the throne closing the seal using johan going through the rift and destroying whatever is there at its core was there another option oh well it's like of one of the ones where we put someone on the throne and we go through the portal do we give it to george or do we give it to the queen of things well you said that you you you who made me powerful you took my soul you meant great things for me this seems like the moment that I should know what to do but I don't you could ask in what queen of these will betray us okay we got five questions focus on one first what option would you have taken ah one close the rift like that oh why is that the best option you need time and you don't have it I asked her if we can save my father can we save Johan in the process unlikely but not impossible but not impossible close the rift so that sounds like we should take johan's offer right now but not right away go through the rift find what's there go through the riff first yes if I get lost down there can you bring me back no that's for questions or is that fine that's she kind of just gave some freebies enough if we do go we'll maybe she'll know how we can get back how do I get back offer yourself to orcas wanted to do that anyways yogi will teach you power and with that's my five questions oh maybe choices this is a game right like it's supposed to be fun right here I'm so stressed out I was I was like shaking when it was like putting around the throne I'm like come on this can't be the no no no no now my solution is go offer my soul to orcas I think that's the clear and present like just go do that you've wanted her since day one and it'll just give you teach you power which you love it's a win I wasn't I'm not okay you know episodes over will discuss [Laughter] that's where we're in for the
