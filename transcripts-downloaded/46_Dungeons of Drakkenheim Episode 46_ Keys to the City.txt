struck by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed Wolf Aleve the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon Highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon Heim when last we left our heroes their pursuit through the under taverns and structures of the queen of Thieves in a desperate gambit with the rattling x' has left them deep in the queen of thieves lair passing through hallways of trap of deadly traps through the queen of Thieves as office they found Katarina von castles inner sanctum a private Treasury her wardrobe in bedroom and a strange octagonal chamber wherein Sebastian sat upon a throne upon which his flesh was seared from his bones leaving only a skeleton behind being right now are the heroes beast is helping so you see this this smell of something kind of like burnt pork it's your nostrils I don't is this as all the remains on the throne is a blackened skeleton don't do something I don't know what to do can we hi rub some ointment on the on the skeleton as you go to touch the skeleton it disintegrates crumbling crumbling today from where you touched it yep the skull falls off onto the ground and crumbles into a pile of dust that scatters about the room I start swooping through the dust and like and it's falling through my hands yeah as you pick it up it just falls right through your hands I start sweeping it up into like a little container anything anything you're sweeping and sweeping it up and as you do the dust just kicks up and and swirls all over the only saving grace is that he's now kind of inside me breathe it in breathe it in vail we can't bring it back from this right right I don't know um I rush back into like the room and I start like looking through her stuff to be like is there anything that points me in the direction of why I'm a denial now there's lots of makeup and some masks and there's a red wig that kind of looks like Sebastian's haircut we start to build a new Sebastian no the hair is all wrong and I start to fix it like fine goggles okay there there's a pair of goggles in there that kind of looks like Sebastian but you tore them apart and broke the lenses when you're raging through the hole okay no seriously okay get her selves together what do we do I don't know do we I would ask Sebastian what to do it's true he was always the planner um what about this throne and I start to like inspect the throne but I don't want to touch it okay give me an investigation check 21 you see that there are residual motes of arcane energy thrumming through it almost in the outline of where Sebastian is but I know are you trained in Arcana nope okay you you can see the visual traces of it it looks like magic but without any training in our formal training and our kind of it's hopeless to identify what's actually occurred can the throne move if I push it if you place your hands on it and try to push it the way you were did that I wanna yeah I want to like try to push it from the back okay you it's almost right up against the wall but you're able to move behind it and start pushing at it and with a screeching noise it moves very slowly front from the wall probably weighs a couple hundred pounds I'm chucking behind it maybe he's just maybe he's just behind it I've seen magic tricks before you moved the throne fully off its of its original place and leaving deep rents and scratch marks and in the floor but there's nothing underneath and then checking the ground underneath it yeah give me an investigation check 13 you tap thoroughly across across the ground there's it's solid I take my mage hand and I start to Pat and feel like the is it cushioned the the throne is is stone it is not touching okay just to feel if there's any like crevices or anything with my mage hand feeling around the only thing that you can feel as you look around with it with the mage hand is it seems like on the wrists of the throne there is a compartment of some kind is it is on the arm rests is it locked or can I use my mage hand to pop it open you pop it open with the mage hand and a pair of manacles fold out and over the arm rests and then another and as that happens a a compartment opens around where a person's neck would be and another manacle slides out so that if someone was sitting in it they would be locked in place around their neck their wrists and their feet and where would it face they would be facing straight forward I like towards the door or the fire yeah towards the towards the wall because the throne is in the middle in between the two doors of this octagonal chamber it's not in the Queen's bedroom it's in it's in it was in the manger it was in the main chamber about you [Music] where it's facing I'd go and I use me a mage hand to feel the wall okay it faces opposite where the little table is with the bottle of wine feeling the wall there's a piece of artwork here it looks like to be a scene of several craftsmen defenestrated a moneylender and the look around there's nothing behind the painting though I know it's not its intention but I want to try to use the helm of telepathy to read the thoughts of the pile of dust the pile of dust is just a pile of dust nothing can I sense Sebastian's thoughts anywhere in this room you cannot in fact as you look around it's hard to see any traces of the dust anywhere anymore I get down on the ground and I start to look at the ground to see if there's any any holes or anything I'm like whoa where did the resister Bastion go No and I look and see there's no trace of wind in this chamber just the dust is spread out and it's either dispersed so thinly you can barely tell it's there or but even rubbing your hand across the stone floor like it turns up the dust of the chamber but nothing else [Music] I don't I we can't even there's just the pile that we had in all his stuff is all stuff gone yeah all of his belongings anything that was on his person was gone seized doesn't any sense know this place makes sense where did the Queen go we chased her to a dead end um I want to I want to go around the rest of the walls and see if there's anything else like I really wanted to yeah time to taking the time to go around through the walls I'm helping yeah the only other opening in here is that small chimney that you came through as gas [Music] did Sebastian have the wine we we each took a vial of it okay but he took two yeah no you took to know why he did yeah okay so we we can get out of here but we can't leave this mister when are we gonna get back in are the two of you going to spend some time searching around through the room then is that your antenna yeah okay with that I'm going to have the two of you step out and Kelly get back on in here no you too yeah secrets [Music] what's up hey Callie Sebastian as you sit on the throne there is a flash of light before you as you see the flesh seared off the bones of Vayu and Pluto we're leaving behind only a blackened skeleton as a bolt of lightning strikes both their bodies oh my god I okay I I jump off the throne and rush to the two skeletons you rush to the the two skeletons and what do you do oh now I have to make a choice okay I rushed to Pluto's skeleton and try to grab it as you touch the skeleton it begins to crumble into dust Oh God and then the door opens make a perception check we have it - okay one of the doors flies open behind you and all of a sudden you feel the arcane energy that you were was on your body stripped away from you someone has surprised you and cast a spell magic on you so I lose like all my telepathic bond yes Oh God I spin around to see who's there it's cat cat what did you do to my friends they're all right they're all right no they don't but they're fine I'm looking at the skeleton and the pile of ash on the ground she says come on she pushes open the door to her bed to her bedroom and the room is completely intact she taps her nose just an illusion no it's perfectly real it's the other ones that you were in that were fake why did you bring me here so that we could talk on our own without those two bull heads getting in the way of it okay let's talk cat all right finally [Music] listen there's got a lot of anger and Pluto is a Caspian and that whole family I should know because they're my grandparents well through I'm related to them through my mom they're gonna come in here and they're gonna take over this whole city of you get them the chance if that's what you want for dragon time so be it but I have to be honest at this stage look what's happened I'd now from all of my boys about what's going on in the city and it's not good it's really bad what has happened with these rattling has doomed any chance we have of saving the city we can take care of it at this point we don't even need to worry about the silver order that army is marching to their deaths there's there's ways to deal with it I I know there are I have a plan really yes I always have a plan my perspective looks like you're grasping at straws there's there's a musical instrument that can lure the rats I've been informed about it that many if some start to follow they all will know they don't work that way I communicate with Sebastian whatever you think you have with one of those rattling x' they're getting smart they're gonna learn what's going on they're gonna figure out this whole thing and they're a bigger threat than anything else now we have to focus on what we can actually achieve whatever you're trying to do right now you're trying to make a play for the throne and I can't let you do that why not you're a spell caster there's rules who told you those rules the amethyst Academy and who told you the stories of the sorcerer kings of old they amethyst Academy and why do you believe them why wouldn't either who else is there it makes sense that a mage on a throne would would be a problem and it makes sense that the amethyst elite and who told you that that made sense haven't used the amethyst Academy the same people who didn't tell you who your mother was they they raised me of course they did because it was convenient for them and the story of the sorcerer kings is convenient for them why is it convenient to not have a mage in power because that way they actually can be and no one's the wiser they put me in power they did they did I can change things maybe you can but right now whoever's gonna sit on that throne is going to be a ruler of nothing but a city filled with rats but there's still a good reason to get that throne we can get Mouse back through the throne I think so [Music] and then what happens after that [Music] well we can take it one step at a time can't you've tried to kill my friends for all I know they're dead right back there why the hell would I trust you because of what we've been through together you you abandoned me you never showed your face again I made a mistake and I wanted to talk to you about it and you disappeared and then it became a scary thing to ever see you again and now here you are and you're the monster that I always feared that would come from the accidents that I caused you know you're gonna have to there's no escaping those memories and you know better than anyone else that there's no escaping who you are but Sebastian to your credit you're this son of one of the greatest Archmage's at the past 100 years I read her books she's brilliant she's thinking was thinking of things magic that are just completely beyond anything I could imagine you have power real power we're born with this and we have the responsibility to use it not to steal the throne that's an opportunity that's stolen from us all these rules of the edicts of lumen why why should they be we can change those things well that's just what we're gonna get started with what do you have against Pluto taking the throne or veo being the Lord Commander to be perfectly honest I could deal with a was a Lord Commander but pollute oh we could find something for him but him his nephew no not on the throne why not cuz it's mine but it's not it never was it is and it can be we can change it and if we have it we might actually be able to do something but if you put Pluto's nephew on that throne well there's gonna be many more people they are gonna try to control him but no one's gonna control me if we put bluto's nephew on the throne the three people who are going to be telling him and advising him are going to be his uncle Pluto who is one of the strongest and most valiant hearts that I've ever met there's gonna be me the Archmage who may have caused some problems in the past but I think that I can throw together maybe a few plans that don't involve the rattling I'd like to believe that I I can be a smart influence then we have Vale the Lord Commander those are the three people that might be true if you manage to deal with the Rowling's but at this stage you're not even going to get into the castle unless you want to work with me I don't want to fight you cat I don't want to have to fight you anymore either but I don't see how I can let you just take the throne after all I've seen you do after all the threats the lies the deceit not to mention lies and deceit who watched me get poisoned you put me up against a monster in the fighting pits you threatened me with a bomb under the Cathedral when we were trying to do good hmm I even vouched for you during that meeting but it's all worked out hasn't it no there are more problems now your men are problems that you created I take responsibility for the rattling situation I lied to the rat Prince when I first met him I convinced him that we were his gods and I used him I used him to get places I used him to gain intel i used him to enter the city I used the rattling 's every chance I got so that I could get a foothold in what was going on in the city and get me Vail and Pluto into a position where we were able to make more powerful choices and help the people out that we needed to help out I didn't foresee it going this way but just because I made a mistake does not mean that you should be able to take the throne so why are you so mad at me for doing to you what you did to the rad Prince as the rad Prince wasn't my friend we used to be inseparable we used to be more than friends a lots happened yeah but instead of coming out and and confronting me you hid you lied I had threatened you almost blew up Pluto your men did and now I'm still the one holding all the cards and you're still trying to tell me that we can work together and be friends while you attempt to backstab and murder the people I care most about my capacity to backstab and murder has become greatly diminished by the circumstances that you have created good that was the goal that is why I have the rattling x' here and yeah it's a problem but you're the bigger problem well crashing two problems into each other is a good way to solve both of them at the same time I'm telling you right now that before the situation gets any worse we've got to make that one shot we can do it but you have to work with me let's say you convinced me let's say I agree what about Faye on Pluto I'm not gonna kill him I will try all I need is one day on that throw one day and you'll get MOUs back yep well you and I and maybe your friends can get mouse back and what's stopping you from killing us when this is all over I don't know if you've noticed Sebastian I'm really good at tricking people but I'm not really good at fighting myself and I'd rather not and at a certain point there's a little bit of brute force that's needed in this situation when I first stole all the badges and I had enough to get into the castle I went in I've been in the castle and well let's just say that there's things that exceed my own abilities I don't want to kill you I don't even want to try because that hasn't gone well the last few times for either of us you have your whole basis being over one with run with rattling z' and your men are fleeing and I just watch my two friends get turned into skeletons and I'm lost in the maze of your labyrinth dungeons here so maybe maybe there is a point to us working together but if I'm going to make that work if that's going to work for me because I need to make sure that a few things are in check if this is gonna work if you want to get into the castle and get Maus back as badly as I do and you need me to do that then you also need Vale you also need Pluto you've agreed not to hurt them if any harm comes to them I will murder you I won't hesitate they are my best friends they are the most important people in the world to me you used to hold that title but it's obvious that you've changed so you will be under our supervision at no point will you leave our sight we may even have to bind you or something to keep you secure there's no running away there's no getting your queen's men to come in and assassinate us during the night keeping you around as a liability because I don't know if I can trust you so we're gonna have to figure out something and you don't have to keep me around if you don't want to I can offer you another deal I'm listening open that door she points to the Treasury door keeping my eyes on her I moved to the door and I actually I'm gonna mage hand and open it up while still looking at her inside the room are several chests similar to the ones that you saw in the previous room but there's also a table upon which is lain the Lord commander's seal the stewards badge the box the high flame keepers amulet and I gotta remember what I call these things and the guild masters seal and the castle ins seal we have everything we need if we're going to the castle I get to hang on to those fine fine [Music] are they okay to touch or is this another trap they're okay to touch using my mage hand I grab each one place into my bag of holding including you said the bomb was there too the box is there yeah now one take a seat she gestures back to the throne [Music] I sit down hey guys back [Music] as you search around the room there is a crashing noise as all the dust in the room collects back together reforming a skeleton upon which a bunch of flesh appears on you guys are alive how you're alive deep inhale deeply in half in some of you I like pat your face just making sure I'm like what don't you were ever skeleton teleport again I saw you guys get blasted into skeletons you were skeleton your skeleton there's two of us in one of you you're scallops and we're both skeletons and I tried to grab one of you and you turned into dust I it's actually at this moment we're all - we're all rejoicing that I look around the room to see if there's anybody else there there's no one else in the room we were just these two where did you go [Music] what explain this your our magic our yeah yeah the magic explaining I I open up my bag of holding and I look inside is everything's still there got some splainin to do guys I don't get what's going on right now but something tells me it's not over with the queen of Thieves well yeah of course she's been running away from us no I found her yeah we won she's here she's just in a different here magic there's yeah I don't know what her play is but she told me that we all needed to get into the castle and she could get mouse back I told her that the only way that I would allow that is if she was under our supervision she then opened a door and showed me all of the badges the box and the key I took them and put them in my bag of holding and now here I am so she's not under our supervision because she's not here and I don't really know what's going on but she sent me off with all of the stuff so you have it in the bank I can see I go to your bag holding and I I pull the items out go just so that we can like check them I take the two I mean two of them you've never seen before which are the the guild masters seal and the castle ins seal but the ones that we have seen before they all like yeah yep okay I'm gonna let's break this chair this is a deadly this shouldn't be just out can I see my father's badge and I look at it and I just like rub my hand over top of it and I take big sigh and I hand it back to you hold on to it I can't hold on to this one I need for safekeeping I need my badge and I would like the Lord commanders bench and I fix it to myself nice I will get you the properties of the Lord commanders badge so we got what we came here for I hope you guys understand that I mean in the circumstances first of all I didn't want to fight her alone second of all she offered me all of these things and just said we need to get another castle I told her that she couldn't take the throne she said she was going to and I said no you're not and we argued about that for awhile I told her that if she harms either of you that I will murder her she said she promised me that you guys were all right and that she wouldn't try to kill you but I don't know where she is or what her play is but she said that she is going to the castle with us we have all the badges now so I don't or one of you the queen of Thieves think so I don't even know anymore man does the look I don't care what happened what was your what was your former your former navigators name rat food okay she might know that me do me ask me your birthmark here you got it well you haven't sold me well look I just mean what's your wife's name actually I don't even know that now I'm just trying to fish for answers anyway if they look enough that's not important right now there's there's something happens every question the queen of Thieves is on to us not only that okay we have what we came here for she did make a very valid point and I need to apologize to you guys I have spent the last several months promising myself that I would not do any more things that caused horrible incidents and meanwhile I hold myself mostly responsible for the rattling that are coming up through the sewers now and why yeah we kind of died I'm really proud decision we really did work you guys contributed but that was my lead I I can be a little persuasive or deceptive or intimidating depending on the role necessary ie hey I started that lie and I I'm the one who told us not to kill the rat Prince I'm the one who who who convinced us that we could use him as a weapon and Here I am I'm still I'm still causing incidents I'm still causing problems I'm still not a hero I'm still just Sebastian Crowe smashing we did it together well we have to end it together Sebastian do you ever think that causing incidents is actually a strength no because it is how well you know things that are meant to be meant to be you know and by you causing these incidents it just leads to a chain reaction of good friends meeting each other you know finding the truths of people their true selves how we've gotten to this place there are friendships not gonna mean anything if we're all eaten by rats I mean I will still mean something I so need something a greater cosmos okay we have a rat problem yeah I don't have a lot of knowledge about magic but I can tell you that we wouldn't be here right now if we didn't do everything that we did to get here for good or for bad we're here now we're gonna deal with it she said to me that there's no stopping the rats no and I need I need to prove her wrong and she said we would also never get all the badges and yet here we are she handed them to him I know so she doesn't know what's gonna happen stop listening to these other people listen to you or at least veo and sometimes me yeah stop questioning yourself you literally are holding the staff of power right now with that you guys have a bunch of items that bear the symbols of the city she's in your head is that where she is and you got it are you the goons and I need you to trust yourself I I will also mention because you did hit you with the spell magic the telepathic bond between these two is still in effect but you've been disconnected yeah guys I don't have to help ethic bond anymore can you send out to everybody on the channel and let them know that we've acquired the badges queen of thieves is still at large in here I wasn't sure if we could do it here because of the private sanctum all right well we have some potions do you guys want to get out of here bye I think we've overstayed our welcome I chew hand ignatius and I still yell it and I just bring it down on this stupid chair there is a clang as ignatius Cleaves deeply into the like Cleaves into the stone but it is made of stone so the blade deflects off of it oh and had you hit this stone with a non-magical blade the blade probably would have broken I use my masonry tools and start to chip away okay I just know angrily attacking it with like a small file and pickaxe thing as you as I'm pulled into the other you you did it you did it you killed it killed the throat you did it it's coming back it's done it's done it's done drink your potion let's leave this is gonna cause who's gonna cause more nightmares than like the one I had about like a giant thing of cheese chasing me and that was pretty scary drink your potion it's time for gasp Ashton to leave you dude whoa you become three farts again yeah it's worth noting that that because the telepathic bond is gone Sebastian can't communicate with you guys as gasp but darn I'm just talking to myself so the tube which way are you guys gonna go back up the tube okay you head back up at the tube and you're now in the queen of Thieves is office I say let's keep going gaseous form although out yeah I keep floating until there's like wasn't there like a can we go back to the passage into the underground into the under to where the under tavern was or where did you want to go we could go at that little hole that you found like the first time we were in here and then try to go up to like you saw light right yeah in the caverns could we go there that's I know it's off the beaten path I mean we're gonna go back through the rats but but we're gasps we have actually I can't talk to you right now I have plant a question do you think Sebastian is coming up with a plan or do you think we should just as gasp can you can you like shape yourself in and that's like a stop hand or a one know how you form yourself into a jump you can follow each other basically you're kind of like there's enough that you can kind of perceive where each other are I'm following Sebastian I say well I'm gonna go a little bit ahead of Sebastian and I'm gonna like point in directions to be like this way make the arrow yeah you can make yourself into an arrow and then a question mark and then I just end up floating past you and okay at general direction so which way you guys gonna go we're gonna head down into the caverns through that that hole that we found the first time we were here okay so you're you want to go all the way back to the prisons and back down into the caverns and then through wait you mean the caverns that you located when you were in the prison when we were yeah cap yeah it's not far from here you would so when you head out from the Queen of theses office back to where she had her art gallery you're in this intersection that you can either go to the tavern where there was a staircase that everyone was fleeing up and then there was the spiral staircase where blackjack mill was as well and that went down to the fighting pit that went down to the fighting pits which then go down to the prison again the cells were near the fighting pits we also haven't seen big Linda do you guys want to go down to the fighting pits and just check like scope it out as we leave that's impossible we could also like remember her chambers that she was gonna leave us into we could go there like when we first got in and we first encountered her there was rooms that we never checked as we ride the chaser yeah but is this a looting opportunity or is this a get out while we still can / - oh it's definitely like that's what I don't know yeah but what do you want to do you want to go down to the caverns I mean I'm I'm just either way I'm a little frazzled right now I'm not the past I I have a plan but I don't want to say it until I'm out of gas form I'm still pointing in directions being like yes yes I I like turn mine towards Pluto my gas form how could I tell there's races yeah I'm following you you can't use your telepathy thing - lets go downstairs so you're gonna go down the spiral stairs okay so you head down to the fighting pits as you pass by as gas there are a few stragglers that from amongst the Queen's men that run up the stairs but they seem so panicked that they just ignore you and as you head down the stairs you can hear the sounds of chittering rats and screaming battle and you hear this large bascule roar that echoes through the halls that sounds like big Linda as I get to the bottom of the stairs do it can I see the fighting pits from parents you'd have to go around a couple corners but yeah you could get to where the where the arena is I'm going to run gaseous form okay Sebastian becomes a person again guys I need to talk okay hi I'm - is form okay one left all right we have one left yep we have a bomb the rats are all infiltrating this area right here this the cream layer ready as I heard there are some back at my place there's a lot they're everywhere I'm gonna stay a fart fight I can translate but is is it possible we told the rat Prince there once we had dealt with the queen of Thieves they agreed to getting all of the rat links together at Oscars house I don't know if they're still gonna do that but I mean we gotta get as many of them together as possible I think and blow blow up somewhere that's my plan is we use this bomb and we blow up the rat links okay why don't we just I say - Vale why don't we just turn on the bomb and throw it down the pit I think we need to get them I need to get more of them together there's not enough of them here I think there's scattered throughout the city and I think it's just gonna remain a problem if if we can't get them more concentrated in one area well what can we were rats with can you ask River about the the pipes she mentioned River hey it's in a while is everything going okay yeah we're uh were you able to escape the barracks it's bad we couldn't go through the city there's rattling x' everywhere so us and the rest we fled the city and we're making camp out by the old Ackerman mill are the Caspian for the most part safe is the Queen safe we've we were able to bring a litter and a cart and a carriage for Queen Lenore and for the Caspian ziz as well so we're making a camp but as we it's strange we started to leave the city Lenore has been having fainting spells she needs more of the serum the delirium I don't even think we have time to worry about that right now we know she's had her we've been making more for her where she's been thinking that it's almost like she can't breathe she might need to live in the haze forever but we have a more pressing issue we need to deal with these railings we have the letter no that we got we've achieved we've successfully got all the badges and and did you kill the queen of Thieves she escaped but she has given us some kind of like a lifeline she's a she willingly handed over the badges and the bomb and the trigger yeah we don't really know what her game is were optimistic yet concerned can you ask her where she thinks the best place to set off a bomb and blow did she set this whole thing up with these rattling 'he's not responsible for this not surprised yeah it's classic River I mean a classic Queen wherever youíre or me but we have got to ask you about the you mentioned that there was an instrument of old that could control the rattling x' can you tell me anything else about it you tell us about it we would need to check the archives at the Academy itself right now I there's not much that I can tell you but I can try to piece something together that we can go on in the meantime though I've sent a message to the other majors that are at the Academy tower it seems the place is secure for now but we have no way are in or out now except for the teleportation matrix which is not stable everyone that's there is trapped there unless we can fight our way through the city again we may have to go damn McQueen and those railings Plan B would be reduced why you have all the seals of the city we should let the Lieutenant Commander and the others know because if we have those we have something at least there's not going to be a city to save if we can't get rid of these rats we could potentially use the defenses of the city now we can get into the castle Plan C is this enough Badgers to control the execution are we missing what Badgers are we have the the staff of power we have the circlet we have two of the badges we have the badge of the lord commander and the badge of the stuart stuart we also have the high flame keepers badge you have seven of seven seven of seven of all of them yes so we can we can control the execution conceivably yes and the walls conceivably yes if we get to the throne yes and then we can kill the rattling x' with the defenses of the city perhaps we can well the city engulf itself there here are we essentially bringing down Dragan Haim upon himself well maybe it's a way to contain this plague maybe that's the best we can do is to save Drakon but save the rest of the world they're having seemed a pretty intent on expanding their feeding area yeah you might we have to end we have to end this I really want to use that bomb III think is veo mentioned that there could be repercussions though these rattling seem to draw on the power of the of the haze can you ask her if her about that if if if the rattling is feed on delirium will kill them or will it it's still an explosion though that's the concern the initial blast deposits quite a lot of energy into the immediate area and then it leaves behind [Music] Heys so yes it would destroy a large number of rattling x' but the effects of its long-term the rattling seem to be unfazed by it so really it's just it's not per se that delirium afterwards that I think we might have to save the bomb for the upcoming war potentially so then if we can get to the throne we may be able to take over the defenses of the city I mean potentially it's our best bet right now is that our best play river I need you to somehow get in touch with anyone at the academy didn't get any information and Ken on that musical instrument that could control the rattling we're gonna make for Castle Dragon please stay safe are you okay though should you want to meet us back at Eckerman mill to regroup so that we can at least plan our next steps I don't think we have but I don't think we can make it there where we're like in the spokes and you're at a Korean mill we would have to round the city yeah going through the city right now it's a deathtrap so not only would we'd have to go around is fire we could go around the city and then I mean are the rats really gonna hurt us right now they might I don't know I think I'm nervous about lying my way through a city of rats okay but maybe we do it as gasps we have one potion left fly you can fly somehow I think yeah I mean I don't think we have supplies we have resources and not to mention you need seven different people to use the badges I think it might be best that we go there not only we need people and I know just the people where's Black Jack now no is technically from what we know you actually need eight you need seven counselors and a monarch is your nephew here yet yeah is if we want to use this whole power of the city then that only answers to the monarch themselves with the power of the council no need your nephew maybe or Lenore or the queen of Thieves maybe I could sit on the throne and give up my badge well I'll have the staff of power you have the Lord Commander yes Jupiter River Ansem Jupiter River Ansem the three of us Petra now we'll need of hot we'll need a flame keeper we're how are we gonna get one of those I say to one of you to somehow hearing hey I mean we haven't totally burned bridges with liquorice Mathias yeah oh my god oh my god do we have to talk to live here Oh make it oh my gosh well it's either that or we try to go back to the Paladins but I doubt they're very happy with this right well I think we could probably convince the paladin's faster than we could have a creature Matthias holy why don't we escape well we still can we go to Eckerman mill we regroup we pick our team we put together a team we gear up for what very well could be the last the last Hall for reclaiming dragon hime the homestretch the endgame where were the paladin's last seen at their camp and where was that camped on outside the city along a long temple road because we could go there first that way towards Eckerman milk I don't know because isn't in the south west yeah the the camp is to the southwest yeah other that's Oh like me much if any news has gotten back door Marshall I killed the rest of them like we're not I we're not doing watched very shot at Griffin is proud of you so you want it what do you want because if we can would you rather try to talk to the the paladin's than talk to a location Mathias I don't even know I don't know I mean it's I think it's the lesser of two evils yeah true I don't totally trust the curse you're not why would they agree to reclaim dragon high are you sure you haven't burned a bridge of paladins yet I mean we burned a cord of Pallas turned one court yard full of paladins the problem with the paladins is they want to burn the city and you know what they have every reason to demand that now that it's running do we actually need a flame keeper or could we appoint someone as flame keeper like all right you you need in order to enact the power of the badges you need someone each person needs to be attuned to the badge and they therefore they must meet the requirements in order to attune to them most of the badges don't have any specific or two-minute requirements the only exceptions to this are the staff power which you must be a spellcaster well specifically you have to be a sorcerer lon a wizard and the high flame keepers amulet in which case you have to be able to be a divine spell caster such as a cleric or paladin in order to attune to it the question is do we try to unburn the bridge of the paladins or do we go straight to the question what was the creatures deal she wanted to delirium Jam till their crystals and everyone's heart but we can't promise that to her I already promised it to him his enemy but she loses if the rattling is destroy everything she built so the enemy of our enemy the rattling Tsar the main enemy oh man Lucretia my pious Lucretia Matthias does not want the entire meteor to get eaten by rattling who turn into super rattling and just and eat her and we can tell her about how great we are how we killed a bunch of paladins maybe they she'll like that maybe brats usually my opening supper a gate people now yeah I killed people you don't like will you be my friend okay so we go to Ackerman mill maybe we send to Lucretia Matthias water well we use the sending spell a magical letter wait what if we approach her as if do you still have semen I do and like we have the things in our chests I don't know we tried them before we did it without with no good magic and we have great magic what all my lives have gotten we get so much trouble Ignatius gave up on us and its problem I just realize we lie and we murder paladin's I say we just I think that we have Wheatley and we have a card here though like she doesn't want tracking him to fall to the rats she wants dragon hi guys chat with her and see let's just see what happens what's the worst that could happen okay let's get back to the acraman mill and we'll figure it out from there and well maybe ask some of our own counsels opinions on it well now that we're in the basement surrounded by rattling x' and looks like maybe a giant monster so that I could tell you guys that I wanted to blow so this whole time Sebastian's been saying things and veo has has to relay what everything I feel like a walkie talkie here I mean what is that okay I say that we break through the secret tunnels I try to get out of the initial area because the initial area is flooded with Queens men rattling I we just need to like have we called off all of our troops on the surface yeah they've retreated all over the streets now so the rattling seem to be moving to the surface so I think our best bet is to actually go underground because they're all coming up okay so we go the opposite way and hopefully maybe they didn't find that secret tunnel that's my only play if we go on if we run into them we can still play the card of yeah we have to go jumps service are we a best-guess couple hundred feet maybe it's possible but but you don't have a clear sense of how deep underground you are because you came up from like you came through all the tunnels initially yeah but you're definitely like initially you came up from probably about 200 feet or so underground so you could be as as much as any anywhere from a hundred feet to fifty feet underground right now I say we're closest oh I can't go that far let's go for I don't want to I want either of you to that was that was horrifying that was scary and yet I wasn't frightened so how will you proceed say we just make a break for that tunnel sure let's do it because have any other ideas I'll follow you let's do it plan master all right it's passion glad you know let's go yeah I'm glad you're not a scholar we screamed for like a good 20 minutes yeah solid it was all panic screaming at the same time was I like I sat on the throne and turned into a skeleton and we had no nice side of the throne and you guys just read indiscreet no whoa yeah yeah you literally didn't even know we're just like we don't have any plans without you they always just if I was just crying putting magic in the air she didn't know it oh yes you guys usually need somebody of intelligence on these sort of missions yeah well as you make your way further down the spiral staircase back tour back past the arena to the sounds of the by the end of this conversation the roars has stopped oh that's not good okay and the sounds of the battle that was in whatever was coming through the area have diminished but you can still hear the the chittering of rattling and as you take your way down the stairs to the queen of Thieves prison this area now looks like it's been completely abandoned there is no sense of anyone having been left behind down here anyone that has has long since tried to get away you head back down to the intersection where the prison was so you're at this intersection that would have led back up to where you first met with the queen of Thieves back over to the cell block or then down this broken tunnel or then over to this cistern that leads to the sewers it was the broken tunnel we were looking for yeah are you still gas yep you're falling behind yeah I'm really slow yep okay and you're gonna take the broken tunnels true yeah those are the ones that like we've the secret tunnels that we cut down that we're caved in yep I can use mold earth-2 to clear them away all right you head into the tunnels and into the darkness and I think there is where we'll take our break and we are back from our break

the screen with that let's return to the ruins our heroes now have ventured back deep into where they first actually were involved with the queen of Thieves past the room where you first encountered her in the flesh so to speak heading clearing away the debris at the end of this disused passage reveals a roughly hewn an ancient set of caverns that wind deep into the earth they continued for several hundred feet and as you head down them once in a while a squeaking rat scurries past your feet then to scurry past your feet as if they're heading towards where you're coming from and then several dozen of them that has collected quickly and they just pass by you merrily on their way well they're not eating us are they small no they're large they're they're big and some of them have glowing purple eyes and bits of delirium growing up their backs like what are we talking like Chihuahua size we're talking like small dog sized yeah I go rad eagle you're supposed to be a rat though yeah one-one that is maybe with the size of a house cat scurries by and it's walking on its hind legs that's not good and it's kind of that's scurrying forward like that as you concerned you get further eventually the cavern opens into a larger chamber where the where where a pool of collecting water can be seen as you approach the room there are more rats continuing forward and you can hear echoing down the hallways growling noises and what you think sounds like a lashing whip that way is it's coming the way that we're going is coming down ah guys fight I'm I'm Pluto for him probably around this time anyway a guy probably switched back a little bit while we were walking just a little bit like cuz i remote you mentioned that I was very slow and I was just I'm already slow so I didn't want to keep being slower so I was like okay I switched back like I'll be like ten minutes ago okay all right what the where's the light coming from there is nothing oh great I look at Pluto and I'm like we need to hide I lay down I rats continue to crawl over quiet like okay I'll hide and you laid out in rats just cover you and I'm like well it's working cancer except I hear you like the panic I'm gonna use just where we are I'm just gonna use to sorcery points and cast darkness okay so that we kind of just disappear into that darkness and I grabbed Pluto by the arm to make sure that he doesn't get lost and then I grabbed the veil by the tail if there's no light then unless they have magical seeing they can't see me true so do you want to just be outside my darkness okay I'll just hold Pluto and in the darkness I'll stand behind your darkness okay you the cavern opens up into this small cavernous cave there is a pool of water and you can see in the water that this pool is is collecting water that is draining down into this like it's a it's an underground aquifer and it is draining out through just over the lips of the water at the edge of the cave you can see that there looks like to be the tops of an underground pastures that is almost completely flooded where the water is draining out across from you is a continuation of the of this cavernous passage that's quite wide much wider than the passage that you came down and though there is stone and earthwork underneath here this passageway looks like it has been borne out recently and the rats are flowing out from there maybe we just need to wait for them to pass what as you wait you can hear the crack of the whip again and these large thumping footsteps once sounds like the rattling of chains guys you don't need to whisper that much let people hear you I I'm gonna can I talk I bail can tell me stuff right yeah yeah so we're whispering I say that we skirt we just scared along the wall you want to pass on that trace I mean if it helps yeah I would like to pass without a trace can I cast pass about drinks okay and we're like up against the wall I'm I guess veo is going ahead of the darkness yeah because you can't see through my darkness so you're ahead of the darkness I'm following behind you at a safe distance guys I'm just gonna be sold on I'm holding do you want to get in my bag I get in your bag can he fit like he'll poke part of his body out like any standard how much is in the bag already cuz Pluto's like 300 pounds excuse you I have a bunch of potions books well once you got your armor and alchemist supplies bad rules I'm gonna say probably pollute Oh with all of this gear is more is gonna like you have to empty your bag quite extensively with all the gold that you've thrown in there as well D&D beyond says that I'm carrying 130 pounds yeah I come for you yeah and so Pluto jacks Pluto Jackson like let's listen uh mince words polluted axons got away what like at least 225 yeah he said yeah yeah yeah oh you owe anyone listening yeah but also darn it so before you there's this rocky outcropping that you're kind of hiding behind by the cavernous pool as the stream of rats kind of move past you completely unperturbed and some of them stumble around in the darkness but others just continue forward following the rat in front of them and it's at this moment that you see coming up from the cavern along with the stream of rats with chains dangling behind it is this massive almost 13 foot tall rattling but it would be more accurate to call it a rat Hulk of anything as the as this appears to be a rattling that has undergone a similar transformation to that of big nose it has spines shutting out from it it has sharp Barb's jutting out from its spine these vestigial limbs growing out from underneath one of its other massive arms both one of which is clearly longer than the other kind of limps forward it looks like as it comes forward it looks like the rattling 's have cut off its arm and replace the front of its arm with an oversized pick and it's dragging it forward almost is to use it as a tunneling tool and it has chains attached around it and as it comes forward another one steps forward behind them is a very small rattling holding on with the chains and cracking the whip on the two of them and and holding the chains a spear and a whip do we recognize this rather never seen this rather not in this room the rattling is wearing a big bucket helmet I say we just get out of here like keep going this group of people is moving directly towards you into your darkness and I like put my hand out to like make sure yeah I grab both of their hands and I push myself as far up against the cavern wall as I can and like stand there perfectly still okay wanna cast detect thoughts on the little rattling okay the three of you can make a stealth check it's plus ten for passive x-rays and because we're in the darkness do we have advantage they have disadvantage on their perception checks to see you 36 okay sure 26:15 okay as you hide up against the wall the rattling z' continue forward the swarms of rats in the larger rat the as you cast detect thoughts from the the tiara that the Thira circle it I know the rattling leading them says it is thinking its find yes yes yes kill and eat many many humans my brother's do so well they they got they grow so big they grow up so fast I so proud of them maybe IV next is it it's not the rat prince is it no okay but similar features it is a rat yeah but as he comes forward he stops and says in his mind that night and he's thinking this say you can see him kind of like Kaka's vision towards where Sebastien's darkness is and he's like they are they see the darkness what wrong with shadows in his mind they are they there he's he's he's gonna come this way I say it in my mind I don't tell Sebastian just cuz I'm worried if I whisper until they oh and I I cast suggestion to do like and I go you want to turn around and go the other way down the hallway because there's humans down there the Ryland gets a 12 it do 13 the rattling thanks humans not this way pulls on the chains on the two big rat the two big rat hulks and they turn around and one of them says - something wrong with shadows yes yes and the little rattling says it's speaking shadow speaking words tell you go other way and the rattling said oh no ecause it wouldn't because the the suggestion is telepathically sent correct with the yeah it's telepathically sent as long as you have some intelligence over three yep he does so the big rattling zoo humans on our way and he and the other rattling says yes yes humans other way I know this rat God speak to me and they the stream of and then the the other rattling the rattling says to the smaller rat says come children yes yes we go back other way and the rat the swarm of all the regular rats turn around and they go back up the tunnel that they came in my head I'm like you do good magic flute oh I don't know what I did I think I can talk to rats I can talk to rats not impressive it's not I not anymore they all talk are we following them I guess so we can try to find our way out of here that was the only way out right that was the continuation of the tunnel the the time well looking around now the way that the rattling were coming from looks like a newly born tunnel he in this chamber itself there is another passage leading out but it is almost completely flooded with water I knew I should have taken I had a free opportunity to take water breathing as a ritual it's okay we don't like getting a little wet I said there's not that much water in TRACON home and this will never come up you try the new pathway see where I lead this I mean that's just where we sent all the rats maybe or we follow the rats or we go for a swim which one sounds I'm gonna I think I should wait here and especially go all the way with me and maybe we Baio you can track them is there display up there is there a bit of the passage sticking out above water maybe eight inches to a foot tops otherwise it's all submerged yep how deep it is it's difficult to tell this this underground like it's probably at least three or four feet deep at this point I want to drop my drift globe into the water and I want to send Crowley to duck by duck I mean like turn sit on the surface of the water and just drink doctors down like yeah yeah like a duck okay duck style so curly float floats down and you can like float around the water with him with somebody and following Crowley at least a hundred feet back there's enough space for curly to float on the surface of the water about 100 feet back but the water itself is about five feet deep so this is like up to your necks yeah yeah as he floats down like does it just continue for at least a hundred feet yes your call water or for the tunnel well maybe the tunnel takes us to where the rats are coming from and we can kill a bunch of them navigator I'm curious to see what's done the new path but if it's just getting out of here then we can take the water we have to get to I think our goal right now is to get to Eckerman mill ok I see we take the water all right let me get wet ok least favorite thing to do you trudge down the watery path for at least half an hour before you see light at the end of the tunnel and the path exits a few maybe a mile outside the city along the dran river are we in the Draenor of there yeah isn't this water supposed to be like a really gross immediately try to climb so you're probably about a mile south of the city along a rocky cave where the water flows out into the end of the dremel it's good to note that that's there now we know way back into the queen of thieves lair anytime yeah I should be using it as earlier for a very long yeah it's kind of overrun everything's wet alright from here can we like climb to the surf like that oh yeah like there's a fair layer of algae and moss and from the river side if you didn't know that this was here like there's there's no farm houses there's no roads anything like if you did not know this was here the chances of finding it again are are very low low right but it is along the river and yeah it just emerges and along this kind of escarpment that's along the side of the river we're heading to Eckerman mill mm-hmm I have an idea to get a Sarah pretty quick I could turn into a giant eagle and you guys could climb on the back I mean yeah I'm gonna do it now haven't tried this one before her flying it's fun right and if I fall off y'all just mother-father the ground that way we get to avoid any rattling around the outskirts of the city and we get to avoid the city in general the downside would be the Paladin camp and anybody else looking up might see a giant eagle flying ya know you could turn into a giant eagle and definitely carry both of them okay I'm gonna use polymorph and again I saw I stick my arms out and shadows start to wrap around them and then look like wings and the cool fall forward and turn into a shadowy eagle I mount you shotgun cool you fly off on Sebastian's eagle back and take to the sky breaking your your wings up you get a good view of the city from down below there is visibly in the city streets outside the city walls they are almost moving there are so many rattling Xan in the streets but you can see as you survey from from the air that there are large groups of the queen of Thieves men running down the roads trying to flee the city as well as others and and other stragglers fleeing the city you can see far off in the distance from from the air the camp of the silver order and where a camp is being rigged up around Eckerman mill as well you can see amberwood village in the distance and the rest of the city looming large teeming with rattling bodies and the haze itself you gotta clean this up okay I think you make a princess because I'm just excited to be on a bird and I just you know are you heading towards the mill tackle mm yeah my family was there too right because they were at the barracks and they were taken out by River okay good I'm like I'm wondering if we should just fly to castle dragon man we need eight people yeah yeah but let's get it let's get a bunch of eagle people I mean I can't really talk to you you say that and I go oh that's okay Tuukka cause mean yes to record windmill and I think I feel like I'm controlling you like I've got like a big tough of hair watch you sure that you feel like you're steering you steering yeah you're doing all you and we're making planes on Illinois missin you land at ackerman mill where the Caspian forces the remnants of the hooded lanterns and the river and Eldrick and those that are there are forming a makeshift camp of wagons the few carriages that they had as well and whatever tents the hooded lanterns had amongst them as you arrive you are greeted immediately by the lieutenant commander and already as well the biggest thing that they've made is there's a huge area where they've partitioned all the people who were wounded in the battles the Caspian and the hooded lanterns not many of them were wounded because they got out before this whole thing really went down but there are still many that are hurt and as you form back into sebastian again the lieutenant commander says well it's good I'm glad you all made it back [Music] rivers filled me in just tell me that it wasn't all in vain we have all the pieces to to end this we don't know where the queen of thieves is something tells me that she still got one play left but at least we hold all the cards now well the badges she says she still holds some of the cards what happened how did you get these from her she separated me from these two and asked me to sit down and talk with her we talked she said she wanted the throne I told her no she then said that we had to that we could use the throne to do much good I agreed that we could do that but not with her she then presented me all of the badges I took them and left as the the group of you assemble and others listen to this story River Eldrick the Lieutenant Commander Jupiter Jones are all assembled here and they kind of convene with a short meeting they set up a little bit of a command post inside the Ackermann no let's draw up a table and everyone takes their seats it's been a long day Lord Commander we'll have the casualty reports for you soon do we want a debrief now or do you need a rest I think we should debrief and then take a rest the more quickly we can get this decided on our next steps the look better this will be all so whatever we can finish this meeting I'd like to see my family before certainly we go back in there River says I'm sorry there's one thing that I just that just doesn't add up to me yes Sebastian do you mind if I cast some spells on you I'm gonna trust you on this one River and I'm gonna say go ahead you're my friend right we're friends yeah she cast a tech magic and identify okay on you and scans you up and down and says I'm sorry I just the telepathic bond broke she cast a spell magic on me when I arrived I just had to make sure that she hadn't messed with you I mean she's been messing with me a lot but but not magically that I can tell I don't trust this either River there's something going on here but at least it's you veo Pluto you know when he disappeared and came back how did you even know it was still him he asked us that question oh I looked in his eye he asked us questions man yeah we're really bad in this question we're super not we didn't even think about that thank you for your magic good call [Music] we were just so happy to see you're all cool and I just wanted to give him a big hug I didn't care he was more out of shock than anything that we were fine with it but but River I see where you're going with this that something isn't right there is going to be another play by the Queen I know it she said she wanted the throne she said she would do it we would all do it together and then she let me walk out of there with the badges did you find out anything what she wants who she is where she came from anything we found out everything the Lord commanders niece will tell us who is she drive to tell everybody we're all working together here Sebastian do you want to I guess I should be the one to tell everybody it's up to you the queen of thieves is Catarina van kessel that's impossible those River it's not impossible what and yet I stood there face to face I unmasked her I the goggles that you made me I saw her with true sight and then she dropped her disguise River you know more than anybody here the history that I have Sebastian [Music] what if that wasn't the queen of Thieves what are the queen of these do last time you confronted her [Music] ran away the last time we were at the cathedral with the queen of Thieves that wasn't the queen of Thieves but you used your goggles Katarina could have been wearing a disguise it was still just a puppet is that what you're suggesting what if the queen of Thieves is just using Katarina is a puppet then I left that puppet down there you know how to get back to her [Music] I mean even if she is a puppet we still have the badges we still know what we need to do but I left her down there I could have saved her it was the Queen it makes it makes sense doesn't it she wants the throne she's an heir to the throne it all it all pans out did you you didn't did you have her as a prisoner did you get to examine her did you use your goggles did you use her magic was there magic on her did you determine for certain if there was a spell that was controlling her if there was an item that was controlling her I didn't really have time it was a tense situation for out a ritual she wouldn't she would have seen that coming a mile away I can't I can't just fling out detect magic it's in my mom's spell book it's not something I know yeah I I blow things up I didn't have options I didn't have tools I lacking that we can't know for sure [Music] castle Ashton just like stands up from the table and walks to the back of the room and it's just kicking stuff can we use the blood that was left in the vaults to determine where the true Katarina is we could we could describe her provided she doesn't have any protections in place she has a private sanctum that's warded from divination magic that's where I met her that's where I left her this is the Lord commanders be the the lieutenant commander speaks up what about her sister we haven't seen her I haven't seen her ever last time he saw her great place the queen of Thieves promised that we could get her sister back if we had the throne [Music] that doesn't make any sense I'm starting to think that I don't know what's happening anymore I I'm at a loss Casey what do you mean that doesn't make sense how would the throne let her do anything like that I don't know I don't know what the throne is capable of the throne lets us control the walls in the city maybe it can open open portals maybe it's a magic throne idea I went in there without a lot of information okay I'm playing with with with what I know there's the woman may be poised access to you guys ready I was guessing maybe we should check the badges the maybe they have something on them let's be sure that they're okay we should what if I left Kat down there then you left cat down there yeah that's not okay we'll examine the badges and make sure that everything makes sense because it just feels like it feels like she's still playing us River continues to cast the identify spell on each of them as you deliberate she touches the first one she turns it around there's a spell on this one it's the Lord commanders this is she points out you can't see it it's invisible but this is the marking of LeMans instant summons this item has been marked by someone powerful and bound to a talisman if it's left unattended and that talisman is then broken its summoned back to the location of the talisman and the only way to break the spell is that the talisman not the object so if any of us leave these if we leave the badges unattended she could call them back at any time only if they're left unattended as long as they're in someone's possession why why would she do that to make sure that she has control over them it's smart if if one of them gets lost she claims it back losses in not stolen maybe she's trusting all of us to go to the castle and she'll meet us there she wouldn't trust us if she trusted us she wouldn't put she's still using us and it's like this on all of them I can check the rest of them even my tiara the ones that you had in your possession the staff of power and the Terra are not and no they don't have that [Music] so that I guess we have to make sure that we hold on to them can you know the other end of this doorway can you find out where this talisman is wherever the talisman that is bound to each of the objects is as soon as that talisman is broken it calls back it calls the object back but if the talisman is broken and someone holds it the queen of thieves learns who learns where they are so if she can't get it back she'll be able to find you then we need to take those badges oh we need to I think that at this point we have to I mean but she can only use it once right even if she finds out where we are she can't continue to use it conceivably yes once she breaks the talisman that's the end of the spell and will we know it gets broken only if you detect magic on it and see if the marking is still there we can't remove it the only way to undo the the marking is a magical sensor but it's bound but the the only way to break the spell by dispelling it is by dispelling the talisman not the object it's bound to the way I see it is we have an extremely large rat problem in the whole city if we can get to the throne with all of the badges we may be able to handle the rat problem we have to continue on that plan if we hold the badges then she might show up and we should account for that we should know that she's a possible threat let's not change the fact that marginally it's true if we're able to secure castle dragon secure the throne and the crown we have the seals of the small council that we have this we could secure we could go out now and secure resources we have everything we need to restore the monarchy we have an heir we have the badges we could restore the small Council we don't hold the throne itself with a crown itself but we have everything we need beyond that you're right don't we need an eighth person to take the throne as well we have one we have George we're gonna bring him into the castle it's the only way he can it's the only way we can put him in the bag it's like a it's like a car seat he's not that yeah this is a river says this is a dangerous plan you three are very competent but if we have to bring people we have to bring four other people to work the badges plus an air into Castle Drakon that puts all the pieces in one place from the beginning the plan was to go to the castle there's no other way that I seated to finish this rattling problem and at the same time retake dragon her that's the only plan it might be a suicide mission but we do have some competent people River I know you're not one for the battlefield but we might need you on this I know you know some tricks you know how to handle yourself yes but I'm not allowed to be one of the badge holders I'm a member the Academy the only exception is the Archmage what if the arch main representative of the Archmage wants protection sure this is the most important mission that I think any of us have and I think we need as many competent people with us as possible that includes Jupiter absolutely I wouldn't turn it down for the world and all of your men we can bring them but we might spend many of their lives just getting to the castle the Lord Commander or the the lieutenant commander chimes in says it's very true if we bring a bunch of Caspian and a bunch of hooded lanterns all marching up towards the castle we're going to have to fight through the rattling x' and the other creatures that dwell dwell there as well we could bring everybody but we might spend a lot of their lives in the process that decision is up to you Lord Commander and Jupiter Jones if you want to bring your soldiers but it may not be the advantage that we would think it would be I don't want to spare any more of the men's lives and we've lost or need to lose before really the war is upon us I think we need to save our strength that way what if we bring as many people as can fit on River Deno polymorph I do yes I can turn two people into giant Eagles you can turn one yeah what's three giant Eagles so that's three people that'd be nine total if two people ran yep we could take nine nine people it's enough for all the badge holders I still think maybe then Jupiter we could give him a badge what if we we give go back and get Kat what if we got Kat and gave her a badge you want to give a badge the queen of Thieves [Music] I've really messed up on this she's channelling the Queen feeds it makes sense that she's the queen of Thieves and-and-and I mean like it's an angle I didn't consider that it was another puppet which really upsets me and I'm just not going to accept that as a possibility right now just like if she wants to be in castle Drakon and she wants the badges and she has the ability to summon them at will if we don't have them guarded I mean what's the worst that's very simple we gave her one Pluto she's going to show up regardless yeah so then there's our each one of them I say we just go there she'll show up and if she wants to participate then help save the city she said she gave it to us to save the city but you understand that from what she's described she doesn't want to use one of the badges she wants to use the throne she wants the throne she needs seven other people so she just wants us all to go there and do it for her [Music] so in doing this we're handing or everything she needs on a silver platter not if we know she's coming we can we can fight her all together what about true true and she's probably betting on that so what's our play show we're gonna have to plan for it him sure River the weapon I pull the box out of the bag and I set it on the table you got it back you want to check this as well make sure it's intact she takes it I mean she examines it the magic on the outside is all there I have to open it to find out if it still works well that's a wild card I don't we know how to take these things apart but we need to take it back to the Academy to do that also she knows we have it so I don't know what our play is that she won't see coming so far the only thing she'd nothing what's that nothing Sebastian she no more secrets we need you here now the only thing she didn't see coming was the rats back hot her off got good oh yeah no now I've said it out loud in front of in front of everybody what do you mean she didn't see the rats coming I thought you said that she did that uh I thought she did too yeah you guys just told me to tell the truth right now so you mean the railings weren't her doing the railings are their own doing we we've had dealings with the rats in the past they helped us get into the city through the tunnels and we thought that they weren't too much of a problem but then upon killing all the Noles they started to multiply and feed and grow demon and then they found a demon statue that taught them special magic and now that was Oscar's fault yeah maybe it's about time that we came clean with all of us hey council um have you guys noticed any weird statues around the city there have been the Noles have these were making totems I we saw them all the time we destroyed them we didn't know really what to make of them River Eldrick did you guys go into the mirror dimension of my mother's no not at all good that's private property what kind of demon what did it look like do you know its name its nature you we know its name his name is orcas Morris and the or and orcas is controlling the rattling he's given them divine knowledge saying he's their God and they have become mutated and focused as a lord of death and pestilence decay disease rats make sense the rat wings were a perfect fit they've how they found that statue yeah we'll never know ye the powers from beyond call out always for eager worshippers demons and beings like orcas hunger to enter our world through whatever means they can the sacred fire teaches us if you believe it that it is the faith in the flame that keeps the demons from entering our world the sages of the Academy have studied this phenomenon to piece together what it is that prevents the planes from all collapsing in upon each other for all Hell to just break loose in our world there is a ramshackle order to the universe that none can truly agree on what it is but suffice it to say that beings like orcas desire nothing more than to enter this world for what purpose for what reason is beyond the will of sages but beings like orcas [Music] have hungered for that for millennia and many of them though they seem outwardly agents of chaos they are patient for they know that the age of the world always turns some believe and very much so the church believed from some time that magic was sent into this world by such forces as a way of letting those powers open up just the crack that they needed to flood forth and it would seem that they have never wanted four-wheeling worshippers whether or not this is the case or true none can truly say I just want to throw a theory out there and it's a high ranking mage [Music] Orcas can wait millenniums for his plans to take effect they say that the great demons and all of that may have brought magic to this world meteor hits our city have magical meteor demon statue start to show up all over the place and the rats of the city become infused with that magic rise up eventually finding the statues and now we're taking over the entire city could this all be a plan of Orcas 'as this dragon hime ground zero for a portal to open and release the nine hells upon us [Music] what just a theory I'm just spitballing here but but it seems it seems weird that a magical meteor crashes here it infuses the the creepy crawling monsters of the city to come out and mutate and change and spread and I don't even know what to my plan for dinner and like tomorrow night my sword isn't even listening to me like how do I fight this how do we fight this otherworldly being know this a demon guys I'm just I'm just spitballing here like that's that's just that's by him I have no proof I believe you I mean and even if we could stop it here there's we've been taking delirium out of the city for 15 years so basically doing his legwork if that's what it's meant to be if the demon Lords or one in particular orcas is planning to make a play for our realm then by selling the delirium and shipping it off to places all over does that is that like have we doomed ourselves we have no way of knowing this for sure yeah you're right I'm sorry there's no take-backsies now we can seriously theorizing coming it just seems weird that there's demon statues all over this place everybody I know is talking to them and and the rattling are like worshiping it and now they're taking over the entire city there's a giant meteor that's that you even said the bomb might not even have a lasting effect because they absorb the haze and become more powerful their little minions of the haze the haze but if this is the case what's their endgame what's their next stage I don't know they they always talked about bringing the rat God then clearly we need to contain this problem which brings us back to the original plan we have the queen of Thieves as a wild card that could show up at any time and we might be doing exactly what she wants us to do but do we see any other option than to march into that throne room with all of the badges try to defeat the rat problem in Drakon hime and take that throne for ourselves knowing that the queen of thieves is going to mess with us but I don't think we have another play somebody can come up with rule over a city of rattling 'z I doubt Sebastian I doubt that's the city she wants to rule over that's true but at this stage we might have to commit all the resources of the city to protecting the world from the city not the other way around and that's where we find ourselves there was a time when I wanted to saved rockenheimer but if destroying Drakon time to save caspia is the ultimate play then I'm prepared to lay down my life now let's be clear we don't know what we don't know but what Sebastian says cannot be ignored at the same time the delirium itself has offered us an unprecedented resource and throughout the ages we have successfully wielded these powers against powers outside this world if the power could be turned against itself it might be our best option if we can secure the city without losing it losing any ground we could use the resources of the throne to contain this problem until we can actually find out for it with certainty that this is the case I do agree because like we can't we can't go just on my theories I'm putting a lot of pieces together right now that are it's a half-finished puzzle is this like one of those rooms with a bunch of pictures with strength red string tied yeah that's orcas and pictures of Dragon I'm and you're scribbling but if I actually and I nod I not at all drew when he says all that in a mic we've always used magic to fight off evil in this world and if magic comes from those dark places I know mine sure does my Magic's always been from the darkest places of myself of my mind of the shadow fell which is why I've always just wanted to use those powers for good if we if there's still a chance to save Drakon hime and the world then that's our ultimate victory if it comes down to it and our final play is destroy dragon time to save the world and that might be what we have to do to either lose dragon hime without going to the castle or we might lose it by going to I would rather take the might than them surefire way I still think it's our best play we know the queen of Thieves is going to get involved we just we don't have any we'll deal with that there's one piece that we're missing here though is we need a flame keeper we need a cleric or paladin we have two options lieutenant I don't know if you're gonna like our first option I'm missing I think I can imagine what your two options are what your two the proposals are you can read our minds do you have the funds to fill epic first option we look to someone who probably wants to keep the Delirium in the city as much as the Academy does Lucretia I know wouldn't do the Paladins any favors but right now there we're probably not in their best books alternative as we try to get them back and we have Ophelia so we either need to make amends with an enemy that we just slaughtered days ago and that's marching on us to war and has plans to burn down the city and destroy the Delirium so we have that option if there's a way that we can talk them into it or reappropriation mathias she's an enemy of ours but i foresee that she wouldn't want the rats here anymore more than we do any more than any of us do so she might be willing she might be she's she's a powerful our ally if she could be ours but what terms she'll demand and Eldrick continues her and her throng pose just as much an issue they do believe that the Delirium is sacred they don't question it they will do reckless things with it if we negotiate with them at the very least they will demand continued access to the city they will demand the protection of the city but we could offer that to them for how will they survive against the rattling otherwise the way I see it is we don't have a lot of options at this maybe today then either do that that's great if we even we align ourselves with her though we sort of solidify ourselves as enemies of the Paladins I think we've already done that when you killed the night commander and I burnt all of the troops I think I was less is true there is a chance for I feel like once we go down this path our chances of ever making amends with the paladins is gone so we saved dragon time in the world but we might reach some ice the more advanced we were to like Westham are in caspia will be against Illyria unfortunately speaking politically few things unites a nation better a fragmented nation better than an enemy invasion and making war against Illyria common war against Illyria would give the nobles and dukes of the provinces a reason to unite behind a new throne a foreign invader would give us the political impetus that we need to give George legitimate control and power over all the other Dukes then it all makes sense it's a dangerous play but it's our only play and it seems like if we can pull it off this may very well be a suicide mission and any number of us in this room could die on this mission I I've told myself for years now that I wanted to do something heroic to prove that I was using my powers for good so if that's what it's gonna be I'm willing to put my life down very well let's so we're going to get Lucretia Mathias if you guys are okay with that fortunately it's the lesser of two evils but I think we have some common wants versus the paladin's where we have nothing we will need to assign the other badges the castle and seal the Lord Mayor's Circle it the guild master seal and the stuart eric's supposed to be here soon isn't he he's on his way yes he might make a very good candidate for the council maybe take up your father's position yeah I would I would definitely approve of that gluto speak your mind I was just thinking aloud like who else could be maybe what the Lieutenant Commander I think is proven himself time and I can't take it I'm under the command of a of Lord Commander Vale I need him here to look after the troops that are left and to communicate with the Dukes and the Lords and set our plans in motion outside of the castle Jupiter Jones Jupiter Jones Evelyn so Jupiter Pluto can take one as well so Pluto you have one I would have the Lord Commander Jupiter could have one Lucretia will have one if she'll agree and some or Petra again and some and Petra as hooded lanterns they cannot accept was I kick him out I mean I won't keep them in what is Erik we need one more what a father your father soul conceivably what if Petra stepped down from a hooded Lantern position to become a member of the council technically yes but there's a bit of a gray area there we can do it River can't either No I mean I father's a choice but then we have three Caspian Zhan the council now that that's a problem Sebastian why isn't excuse me my father I mean he's a he's a blacksmith what position would he take I don't know if he wants that sort of merchant he's leader in communities huh we could ask him I wouldn't force that on him no I'd say either maybe Pluto your dad or Sebastian your dad my father is a great warrior and and and he's come to the aid of Drakon Heim my father makes better armor than your father well my dad doesn't make armor uses alternatively we could go with all dark all door is kill leader okay BAE Oh Sebastian Pluto Jupiter Lucretia Eric Eric who are we missing well there's eight right that includes George trusts seven badges yep you and you can bring River if you want to but she just can't be a badge yep I just want her a big metal bodyguard I mean I want her and her bodyguard is like extra okay or if her bodyguard can even come I think that just having a backup spellcaster but I hope River doesn't die okay so you're gonna bring Jupiter you're gonna bring river you're gonna blow polluters gonna take one of the badges you can ring Erik and you're gonna bring you have one more so okay yeah and do I can tell you the effects of each of them so if you you can choose which ones that you want to equip yourselves with the Stuart is a Perry apt of proof against poison the Lord Commander steel is an amulet of health the Archmage's staff is a staff of power the castle ins ring is a ring of telekinesis the high flame keepers phylactery is a necklace of prayer beads the Lord Mayor's circle it is a helm of telepathy and the guild master seal is an amulet of proof against detection and location okay there's my thoughts me with the Lord Commander it's the one I have to have Sebastian you have your yeah Pluto you got the helm unless you want to switch something yeah I could go either way I'm open to anything what was the detection one that's the guild master which is the amulet of proof against detection of the location and then the castle in the castle and is traditionally regarded as the master of the the castle defenses and that's a ring of telekinesis ooh I could do that and you might be a good leader of Defense's I have to protect George you one time led 100 men into this city maybe fricative but they were killed by rats which is our current problem the ring for Pluto detection one for Jupiter Lucretia with the prayer beads Erik with my father's badge poison and then your father gets your helm okay so that will be the roster that you'll be bringing with you to castle dragon and we're also bringing River River and you and your plan right now is to take the form of Eagles and fly or do you want to take another route to get to the castle itself so from what I know about the castle is it that we have to go in the front door or can we come into it from a different angle how do the badges work to get us into the castle bearing the badges allows you to unseal the gates so I say just to avoid the rat problem and as well the those that bear the seals collectively will not be attacked by the aerial defenses of the castle so it makes a lot of sense then if we can fly us all in I'm just wondering if we should fly from the back and stay on the outskirts of the city rather than going straight through city even in the air true we don't know if the rattling Tsar gonna have like no no at this point poison delirium arrows will need to actually recruit Lucretia Matthias and ensure that she agrees right to all this can we send her and tell her well first of all see if she's made it out of the city or should we go there and get her can we send her and say that we yeah what what do we thinks bad I think I think but potentially just going to meet her we could send her first and say we're sending dragonforce an envoy a peaceful for a peaceful conversation about how best to handle the current problems this is the current RAF RAF during it would be in her best interest it would it would be in all of our best interests to have a discussion I think the best that we're gonna be able to offer her we're going to have to offer the protection and allegiance of the throne and recognition by Wes Tamar of the falling fire as a legitimate branch of the sacred fire recognized by dragon time she is preaching a new faith and that's been one of the things that they've been demanding could it not just be a new faith could it not just be a new not a branch but a tall tree I mean there's there are other denominations of the sacred fire there have been many that have held different beliefs and have different disagreements so it's not the first time there's will need to once this is all done establish some rules in order to govern and control they can have their religion but I mean like they can't go killing non worshippers or anything like that or I think any of the discussion that we have we need to have including included with her like that yeah yeah what her demands could be could be wildly outside of our our thoughts and ideas I think we need to get in touch with her if she doesn't agree to them are we willing to go to a philia we have to that's unless you guys know any paladin's in Europe well it Werner they're unwilling in your arms like if we kidnap aphelion we might mildly aphelion we might not be able to trust them okay [Music] the council we would be giving them by all respects anyone that we give one of these seals it's like electing them to the badge of office of the city yeah we should probably definitely trust them although I don't know if interest appreciate but hey rivers observes probably why the queen of thieves didn't think that her own were suitable you can't trust a bunch of thieves and murderers and she knows that it's true so we do have to be aware that once we get in there there is a possibility that the Queen is gonna show up and possibly try to kill George and take the throne for her own position but she would need us to all agree well I mean we'd have to support her what if we have no other heir to put on the throne what if she holds someone hostage what could she what could she hold over us to make us do her bidding who knows at this stage but that's an eventualities that we have to prepare for right now we need to secure the creature mathias because without her we can't even get into that room but if the queen of Thieves makes a play and we're left with no other option do we accept that or do we let the city fall at that point at that point we have to blow up the whole place we'd let the city fall because the city can't survive if we can't control it we have to be okay with containing this if if even a fraction of what you theorized is true this could have profound impact not just on this region but on the entire world you said we wanted to do the best thing for dragon height at the beginning of this and I think sometimes maybe the best thing for dragon hime is if it's too far beyond or it's in the grasp of someone who can abuse it I'm just saying that if the choice is let the city fall to chaos and be a threat like none other or let the queen of thieves at the throne oh yes she could be the only thing that could save us oh if george yeo we keep saying that that a mage can't sit on the throne is this again like one of those like rules i can't be as it or is it like you sit on the throne and you become a skeleton we saw that happen it was real well it was fake it was okay it real to me strictly speaking the only thing enforcing the edicts of lumen is the collective political will of the nations of a continent it was established in the edicts that there were to be three pillars to the political order on this continent the church the Academy and the thrones and that never should those three should any one person have any sort of authority with more than one those in the church was not now of course as we know with what's happened in Illyria that situation is already eroded and the church defied de facto controls Illyria so it's not like the edicts of Lewin haven't been thrown out by those who claim to enforce them already then I would say that for the good of the world if it meant chaos or the queen sitting on the throne I would rather have the Queen on the throne the word chaos versus dragon hymen chaos yeah laughs agree with you there I hope it doesn't come to that at least whatever's happened to catarina von Kessel this is almost worse than what's happened to her mother and I'm gonna do everything I can to stop this but I would rather see the world survive this this demon thing is just blowing my mind question and I look to you Sebastian and I say your mom had clones didn't she she had a clone yes what would it take to make a clone of George I can ask my mother tonight if there's a way I can we'd have to get back to the Academy Lana it's Lana the even tides magical abilities to do that precedence aldrick do you know any other majors that can make a clone mages have sought for some time for means to extend their own lives if there are members of the Academy that have discovered such means it would only be one of the Archmage's that that accomplishment alone will be worth the title we could see but even then based on what you described we would need the resources and strictly speaking from what I can tell from the way the spell works the clone it takes a hundred and twenty days to mature clone this is also after so after so by the reading of the clone spell like so tactically yes maybe there is somebody in the Academy they can cast it but you need 120 days to mature mature clone and you also need a ton of gold what if we took some of George's blood sent it to the Academy for safekeeping that that's fine but the the way the clone spell works is the clone has to be complete or four before you die okay yeah I'm wondering is there any way if something happens George I mean we'll have Lucretia with us so maybe she can do something but I have a scroll of Ray's dead does that raise them as yes no he'll be under I'm wondering if there's any way like to bring somebody back from just having a piece of them and I look over to George will not die no wait well Lucretia Mathias is powerful and perhaps in that case see this is the part of the issue you must understand one of the issues that has been raised quite specifically with Lucretia Mathias and the Church of the sacred fire this is quite central actually and might be a problem if we want to work with Lucretia the falling fire asserts a very old belief within the Church of the sacred fire that only those of a holy purpose are meant to receive the blessings of a resurrection part of what incited this whole thing and one of the creation Mathias main objections amongst the did that the amongst the core belief that the sacred fire and the the sacred fire believes the Delirium is blasphemous the falling fire does not they disagree the church has been selling their magic so like this the blessings the the resurrections and the sacred fire believe that the Lucretia maintains that that makes the church no better than the amethyst Academy you go girl and she believes that the blessings of the sacred fire are to be given freely to those deserving of it so I hate the Paladins now more than there's such liars you agree with all I'm saying is that it's that we purchase it except he asking it from the peloton so if George dies the Paladins will resurrect work recently not 1000 Lucretia reasoning gives it freely to those who deserve it who deserve it but that's up to her how does she do it just it just makes the Paladins more hypocritical than they've ever been before hmm no disagreement for me on that al Jake is recited with the Paladins you'd have to be okay with the potential that they would come in here and destroy all the Delirium and that's what they're going to want exactly we can't get them it sounds like we have many risks to take if we can secure the throne though we can defend Jack and I'm from the Paladin invasion the best plan of action I can say is that we cannot allow any grim fate to befall young George is he in the room no he's not yet good I think that's gonna be your top responsibility I've said it you may want to many times tonight I've got an idea I will protect him with my life what if we make an illusion that one of us is George and he is someone else what if I see me all of us to be George repoter trick won't know which one of them you won't know therefore all George it's right well why don't I save that so that like I don't know it's gonna be hard to tell who's who if we're all walking around us George but if the queen of Thieves shows up then we just boom we're all George we can see like words like yeah we can do a telepathic bond yeah and code words and I will do I sound like Georgian in our heads if I look like George or no I just sound like me yeah if your telepathic be bonded you can still sound like yourselves yeah yep we got it yeah we're gonna be fine there's gonna be fine you question yeah did you retrieve the Knorr ring I checked the bag of holding it's not in there nope you scrambling through it that's the queen of Thieves way in I like that ring I kind of forgot about it look good on me I mean but if we have a plan to have smarter using her own magic I like the sound of that let's recuperate did we say all this out loud without protecting your space no there's a telepathic bond in this room we wrote it all down on it with secret glyphs damn it with that this council concludes its meeting okay as you prepare you with you have the opportunity for a long rest and congratulations you've just reached level 11 long rows oh and then our points I'm assuming go down again mm-hmm yeah because the heroes feast is off yet look at me nanana oh man that's not great as this is the endgame it's all there the end game more rogue than Ranger what you're taking another level of rogue expertise Oh Pluto what are you gonna you got a third attack I'm gonna just keep swinging just keep swinging Sebastian you know what you're gonna do for your level 11 level up not it looks like I think it's just spells that I got ya sick level 6 spells I haven't I that's uh that's a bad time that's a big all over the only thing I can do for younger I I want to approach young George and I and I and I'd taken me there already he's got his own tent that they saw it for him yeah and I hey little buddy George's a young man he's about 14 and he's fairly featured the familial resemblance there's there's definitely more von Castle in him than Jackson because he has the the very the that kind of coiffed von Kessel blonde hair like you he meeting him in person well he's not impressive to look at he's rather thin young man of four at 14 with long blonde hair and he's wearing a breastplate and has a rapier himself he's been brought up in Caspian style and as he says he says as you come in uncle it's good to see you Oh nephew it's good to see you too was the travel long it it was but grandfather says that this is all off for me I don't really I I think I like Gatsby it better look we both I miss the homeland too but this is part of who you are you're you're a man of two worlds and you're gonna have to make some tough decisions soon and it's gonna get dangerous oh I I know I know mother and grandfather have prepared me for this and of course I've got Keaton here so I can stay brave and he says come on boy and he has a boxer puppy that's wearing a sweater it's blue with like eight lines yeah it's very Caspian Keaton's been keeping me a company you see brave I I'm gonna kneel down a pet Keaton as I continue my the dog looks your hand it's gross I I missed this little moment look I'm gonna be there for you George no matter what and you can trust me Sebastian and veio I've heard so much about your friends I'd quite like to meet them you will they are going to help you take the throne because you're a royal you have royal blood in you and it's time that you took up the throne and restore Jack and I'm - it's true purpose and we're here to help you do it I'm ready I know you are and I'm gonna ready and I'm gonna pull out the parry apt of wound closure like and you're gonna I need you to wear this uncle it's a wonderful gift thank you and it helped me a lot and now it's gonna help you and just to abuse it I used the telekinesis ring to like well I'd like to float it over head around his neck he's very impressed such magic I've always been fascinated with magic your friend Sebastian is a mage they say that the majors of the Academy are here is that true he is the Archmage that's incredible it is do you think he could teach me a spell why don't you ask him Sebastian I was outside listening in hi like you don't want him to teach you I I will teach you ragic look that's incredible I know incredible so you can just you can just teach me to do you magic look what Sebastian taught me and I am George in order to take the throne fail Bad Kitty if he learns magic they hit the dog the dogs barking dog so much is happening in this tent right I've there there's so many great tales of all the Warriors of Castilla but I've read of all the great Archmage's at the academy what they do is incredible do you think you could teach
