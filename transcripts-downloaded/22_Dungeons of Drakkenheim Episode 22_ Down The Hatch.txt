hooded lanterns they have ventured across the city to the ruins of the spokes the Southern District of Drakon haim outside the main city walls in its heyday the spokes were the feeder district to the southward the industrial district of Drakon Heim all manner of trade cobblestone streets and taverns serving the working men and women of drakon haim were the mark of this area of the city the industry hub of Drakon Hine our heroes have ventured down what's with behind us Oh our minis our minis are on the shelf behind us wonderful let's grab them who's looking for gluto of all the things we had a bit of a rush start today so there they are there we go keep though we got to keep them on the shelf because when everything's moving around yeah getting knocked around anyways when last we left our heroes they had ventured into buckle down row a notorious Street of taverns and seedy establishments from the heyday of dragon high which have become the nesting ground for the Queen's men the conglomeration of bandit gangs that have been scouring and plaguing the ruins for the Passover weeks our heroes have ventured to buckle down row with the goal of figuring out what the queen of Thieves the enigmatic leader of the Queen's men is up to because the commander of the hooded lanterns is a little bit concerned that if the hooded lanterns and the silver order were to strike out against temple gate or the Cathedral in order to retake a section of the city that would be a prime opportunity for the Queen's men to drop some form of sabotage which would stretch both the hooded lanterns and the silver order far too thin so our heroes now have come into a tavern which what used to be called the snake and Mongoose adopting disguises once more they have posed themselves as new recruits and entered into a arena battle royale in the basement of the snake and Mongoose where they won a pretty flawless victory thanks to Vale shish kebob archery skills and Sebastian's hypnotic personality and gluto help I showed up my name is Deb I was there I stood there no longer dubbed as fresh meat the crowd has gone wild with the bloody bloody barbecue that you enacted in the arena sands and blackjack now has applauded you and is giving out all the the winning bets pays you your winnings from from the takings so I believe that ends up being about a hundred gold pieces each that you win and so the raucous drinking laughter and the unfortunate sight of stacking up some of the slain bodies of that massive bugbear and the other Hobgoblin that were part of one of the other teams as several of the other Queens men and the various bandits down here start dragging the huge and heavy carcass of this bugbear who weighs about 400 pounds towards one of the doors of the in this circular arena again it's a circular room with three doors one is coming down from the set of stairs from up above and then two heading off to either side one is a door that you're not sure where it's got it goes no one's open it or closed it yet but another goes back into a short hallway which seems to lead towards the sewers of Dragan Heim proper where they are dumping the carcasses of those who died in this arena in the midst of all the excitement several of the other bandits thieves and killers are coming up to you all slapping on the back saying that was some amazing archery how did you do that thing with the snakes in the eyes and you are a very strong man many are offering to buy you drinks people are asking when you're gonna fight again and general excitement and raucous Ness bring me a pint of ale men bring the champions all a pint of ale my name's knife gut Pete's and don't forget on vela human if you didn't notice I'm human though human so even human eat like bread right bring me some bread and some stew of course I'm I'm just trying to keep it together as vo pulls the wool over their eyes see the illusion like I just want to make sure my ears are there don't be human natural human things black Jacmel is this greasy looking guy he's about 5 foot 4 and he has hair that he slicked back with pigs fat and he's wearing like this CD jacket with some sort of pattern that he stitched into it that that looks like it's supposed to be a motif of like playing cards or what you would see on a Jack of Clubs and he's got like a boat high as well as he but for being such a small man he has this booming voice and he cries out alright you all get upstairs and bring down a cask of that special reserve for our champions tonight and we'll get some bread and tell stew to put on another pot yeah human dude there's someone named stew and he makes stew of course that's why we call him stew I like this place keeps everything really focused to keep track of yeah so what outfit y'all from says blackjack Mel as the task of this disgusting bathtub looking moonshine comes down the stairs and he starts pouring for all of you this is real good stuff made it in a bathtub up in one of the manor houses we took over up in Uptown it's a real good stuff it might take a big swig before even finishes talking I'm like knocking it back it tastes like paint thinner it tastes like paint thinner I know it's so good with like my tongue like it like a cat would like start like lifting and I'm looking at you like you're pouring it all over yourself like this is the first time you've ever drank this savage like it all right so you lot I had not seen someone come in here and just destroy like you three I really think you've got some potential which outfit did you say you were with again sorry we're new and a little drunk and we literally just got hired a few days ago I'm getting all the names mixed up we went through a crash course on like all the different outfits which one are we in the recruits and I hold up my arm and show the symbol that we have on and I turn to the other two and say right guys yeah whose corpses did you take those off the men who died that we replaced awesome that's how we do things around here he got attacked by a bunch of our boys decided to kill them put on those armbands and think that that makes you a member of the Queen's men no then we got recruited by Villa and then we killed a bunch of you who wrote of you I've never seen you around these parts before rusty Joe make a deception check 22 rusty Joe but oh man that would have only a few days ago yeah yeah but a few days with the thieves makes you blood you know rusty Joe got impaled last week it was awesome I could show you this corpse amazing it would be an ode to to rusty Joe give him one last it was a good recruiter brought a lot of good folks had an eye for talent if you know what I mean that's what we're doing here so here's what I think I think you all have some really nice potential what are you here for anyways what brings you into our little family I've heard the Queen is pretty cool and Bella recruited us and she talked very highly have you even met the Queen you're your only highly hired like a week ago haven't had the honor but you know as queens go I heard she's pretty good we want to meet the Queen pay our respects you you you want to meet the Queen you so you just show up here and you think that you're just gonna meet the Queen no isn't that why we're killing people so we can meet the Queen yeah I thought champions got it now you're thinking now you're thinking you raise yourself up through the ranks show yourselves good at killing things you'll get your piece - we got a good deal going on here Queen the Queen knows talent when she sees it well I mean do you honestly have anything else to throw at us that's worse than eight monsters hey I mean those were some good good people they weren't monsters there were people you killed them it was awesome but they were people not monsters sorry it makes me feel better when I call everybody I kill a monster fair enough I like to think of them all as kind of just like cattle you know what I mean helps that Plus this paint thinner here really helps take off the guilt I have more of that pain here you go but I gotta tell you beats anything else out here might be wild might be crazy you might never know who's gonna stab you in the back but one thing is important for free you can do anything you want be anybody you want in the Queen's men and no one's gonna stop you not even the Queen she keeps it fair gotta give her the credit for that what about the other pesky people roaming around trackin Haim they ever stop you have to deal with any of them yet yeah once or twice come across a couple of them Rangers see those people those people they only care about the laws when they benefit them they just want to make this whole system bring it all back so that they can control things so that we're on top and they rigged the game to keep themselves out down here we got rigged gambling tables but at least you know what you're signing up for but then you don't even have a choice whether you want to play the game or not you have to play their game and if you don't like it you're an outlaw yeah nail good guys so look you want to fight some more will that bring us to the have you ever met the Queen course I met the Queen what do you take me for I'm before you said of course like Jack now you looked left and then right and then left again and then right again and then you said of course while looking up and slightly to the left were you lying to me mal of course I would never lie all right check yeah what's your insight bonus my insight my passive insight is 10 he with the shifty eyes and demeanor you've you can see right through this but why he would be concealing this from you talk to you to decide well Mel blackjack whatever you go bye BJ Mel yeah I like it BJ Mel well it's you know you haven't seen the Queen or maybe you have maybe it's been a while who has seen the Queen around here well I mean you know people come around you gotta be careful she's got to be really careful people come around here all the time asking can I see the Queen and that turns out their hooded Lanterns she come she's got to play it safe once in a while you know I've seen the Queen I haven't met her personally but I would say that I have a fair ring of connections to her okay and I know that she's got a really awesome hideout somewhere around here you don't know how to get there no I thought the Queen's went all wet and hung out in this awesome hideout I heard so much about it you're looking at it this is our hideout right here like your group's hideout or the Queen's mint hideout so you're new so I'll forgive you a little bit for your ignorant this is our turf all of us are Queens men we all pay a little bit of peace to her she keeps everything organized between all the different gangs the Queen's men are more than just one gang there's I mean there's a whole bunch of us we all got our own turf we all got got our own takes we all got our own games that we play the Queen just keeps us all kind of working together she's got a big plan behind it all but she sends her people out to meet with us not the other way around I'm Deb hey Deb I mean we do got this one joke it's it's real fun it's real funny so once in a while we'd get people to come around here demanding to have an audience with the Queen right so this is this is the funny part right so we tell them which way to go and it's true it's no lie it's the right way it's at least as far as all of us know but it takes it all the way through all of our traps call it the Queen's passage and if you get past the Queen's passage that's the way to the Queen it's just littered with traps you get to meet her it's like a hallway beats me all I know is that whenever the Queen's people come they come that way they just know how to avoid the traps whether or not they got some sort of secret or some sort of other way but that's where they come from all we have to do is throw the bodies down that way to keep her Crocs nice and fit ah so that that pit that you've been throwing the bodies down that's the Queen's passage yeah and that leads right to the Queen's men but everybody that goes down there dies because of the traps well not all of them die I've seen some people come back mauled horrific Lee and once in a while some of the higher-ups the bosses they do go down that way because that's where the Queen has her arena she's got our big fights down there all the really exciting stuff but most of us we don't get invited that way but no I thought you were gonna if we win this and go to the Queen's arena aren't you taking us there so I'll be honest with you I can't take you directly there but you stick with me I'll be your manager you know make it like 20 percent I'll manage all your fights I'll guarantee that after a couple good fights you'll come out into the Queen's eye and she'll invite you down there I guarantee it I just know it for sure how long do we have on human veil an hour probably not as much now how has it been how long has it been since our initial fight it has been about 40 minutes you have 20 minutes I have 20 beers left in order to get through I turn until I get cranky listen Mel we have to complete three to five really fantastic fights in the next 20 minutes I also get cranky three to five fights in the next 20 minutes are you crazy how am I supposed to set all that up no no I gotta get you good contenders we got to have Top Billing otherwise the Queen's never gonna notice to what you're doing you just want to fight a bunch of my boys I mean that's one thing but if you actually want to get the Queen's notice we got to go after something really big we gotta hit the arenas at the other bars you know cause a bit of a ruckus make a bit of a scene get your name out there I think we need to talk to the Queen's men we're supposed to come show us where this final fight is I don't know yeah who do you who do you give the money to Oh BJ Mel well so us here were the purple petals we all work under Mary bedlam and she comes out from the Queen you know once every couple days and we share our piece together but all of us you know we share things we don't have to pay a huge amount to the Queen she's pretty fair about if we fight whatever bigger thing that you have in the next bar over in the arena do you think that will grant us an audience with the Queen one more fight trust me you'll never see anything like the fresh meats fresh I mean I can't runners are like it originated if we want to go to the slaughtered lamb or over to the one of the other bars get a good fight going we can see whoever's there and we'll take them all we'll take them down your talent I mean you just turn that guy into a shish kebab I don't know if that's gonna be enough to get the Queen's notice but I mean you caused it a good enough of the show give the people what they want who knows shish kabobs are one thing but we need to make you know some good drumsticks and maybe a rack of ribs out of this before the Queen's are gonna notice us I want to make someone a pin cushion I want to win a fight that's what I want to see Deb's name in this in the sky it just says I'm losing ourselves in our undercover operation we're just trying to hold his tongue because like what mouths saying makes like this free tract and I'm like and I I've obeyed the law my whole life like these are a bunch of like you wild on crazy you know like this is like I just want to like be like this is your wild summer away from mom and dad like there's rules Mel there's rules for a reason there's a system in place and it's Howard but I can't say it have to be like I'm dead I'm just old Deb can you get us into a fight in the next 10 minutes [Music] I'll see what I can do but I doubt it we're scrappy well we might need felony Bella has to go on a mission we might need a new recruit I mean he got a go sewers right over there you can just let it go well I mean you said there were crocodiles and alligators down there yeah but I mean they're the body's kind of float down the sewer for a little while and then the Crocs come and get them it's safe enough relatively if you got a you know get nature's call going I understand we got a little bored across there with a hole cut in it's better comfortable so classy no fancy establishment what do you expect I need to talk to my manager oh we're still thinking about we're working on that deal now this is gonna break your heart Bella was our manager yeah but muscle you're the fighter you're in their arena you can't be the muscle what happens if you die I'm gonna be the one that's gonna replace you I'm gonna die thinks I'm gonna die I'm not a strong human I can survive anything you bring in the room listen have a little bit more of this paint dinner like water think about it I'm only asking for 20% I can take you all to the top let's discuss what's private discussion I understand I understand oh you don't have very much longer as a human and I don't know theirs so what do we know the other bars have fights going on but there's a passage to the sewers here that leads to the Queens passage that's full of traps yeah we could just go for it and sneak out of here before you turn back into a cat I think if I turn back into a cat they're gonna just drag us down to the sewer anyways but they're not guaranteed to take us all the way to the Queen so you know at least we know where to go or just knowing that it's dangerous what do you think Ludo we could go to the bathroom and check it out and never come back and and like just see if it if it's if it's scary and then if it's if it is we can come back and find a room and fight our way to the top but this seems like a roundabout way what if we what if it takes us like days to to even maybe get an audience with the Queen and who knows what do you think we're better at dealing with a passage full of traps or fighting our way through arenas maybe have about two hours more left that I could be human but after that I'm gonna have to skedaddle to rest up a bit before I can do it again yeah but I think that's gonna take more time waiting for Mel over here to set up these fights okay we're gonna tell Mel that we're going for the fights and then he can be our manager and to set the whole thing up and we're gonna go to the washroom and we'll be right back all right because all that paint thinner has made us all have to be yeah we all have to pee as a team yeah it's part of our team building yeah we it's more we shuffle over in a triangle because you don't want anyone to stab us in the back yeah all right you're learning fast so what's the deal all right now we all have to pee that drink that you gave us goes right through you anyways right they're a little bit too much information but what do you think of the deal we'll take it Mel if you can fantastic here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna head over to the slaughtered lamb now do you want to fight tonight yeah awesome I'm gonna go over rustle up some of the scariest scariest people you've ever seen and you're gonna fight them and kill him you know what Mel you get all of the best and and most horrible Queens men that there are to fight get them all in that bar you get them all there I know exactly who I'm talking about there's a group of people that's already fought in front of the Queen before that are over at the slaughter slaughtered lamb I'm gonna go talk to them you're going fight him cool oh he's so excited I love this mal will be there what time what I mean when the few hours when the moon is where Sun Moon I don't know get you in for the first fight of the night as soon as the Sun Goes Down I know you can't see it in the city because it's always cloudy but as soon as it's dark out you'll be the first fight of the night today's a little brighter also true it is I love this nice weather all right we'll be there Mel now we're gonna go stand back-to-back and the sewer and go to the washroom yeah I understand I understand you know we everyone's got to watch everyone else's backs and especially their own cuz if everyone is watching everyone else's backs we'll all see it if someone stabs you in the back exactly that's my motto I keep it here in my pocket it's also good for back ribs wow you can read yeah it's a he's a show-off although yeah I'm bad about it a lot what you my name is gut gut knife gut piece mascot Pete Bella dead you're some folks see you soon okay all right triangle triangle triangle formation over a triangle formation ready to attack anything that comes shaving over in triangle formation towards the lavatories the wonderful and welcoming smell of like freshly churned up sewage hits your nostrils it's the smell of when relatively fresh water it gets despoiled by garbage and waste because what you realize Sebastien de Mayo is that this passage that the Queen's men think is a sewer it's actually one of the Aquila firs of the this area so it's meant to bring fresh water into the city not carry out sewage oops good job greenspan and so you can see the waste of like the corpses and well human feces and other waste that from this board that they've put up it's a rather ramshackle kind of outhouse there's no privacy whatsoever but they've also been throwing dead bodies and as you walk over there's this kind of hunched over guy that's been dragging the 400-pound body of the bugbears like washrooms over there bugbears body into the water with a splash and it begins to like float as it heads down the line of the water which the way that it's constructed is it's a passage with a stream in the center about ten feet wide and perhaps about five feet deep and you can see that there is water flowing in from the the north and then it's carrying the water down towards the south and then around a bit of a bend where the bugbears body is slowly dragging away there's a walkway on either side of the of the up over before we go down here and that's aquifer yeah I probably needs take a health potion from the hospital you can't hit yeah yeah everything attacked you yeah that's true you were surrounded yeah so I'm just gonna I was drinking wine on the sidelines so we have a couple hours till sunset that mean just means we have to be back here we might not want to get to we don't have to be back here we could just not show up for the fight that's also true I well because if I come back at the time I'm gonna be I didn't want to let Mel down right there like I really was really committed to my new life as dead food oh I'm not gonna lie to you but I am gonna lie to Mel and I did and that whole thing was just meant to get him out of our hair we could sneak into the sewers we're not we're not going back your life is dab is over I'm your Pluto Jackson Prince of caspia yeah yeah I am thanks guys really got lost in that Deb character let's go now we're in a sewer no wait we're not are we in the sewer yet or the guy just had to go to the washer right or like there's yeah you're you're in now the aquifer no I'm a pretty wise man if if all this water is contaminated like what's the queen drinking like what are they what are these people when we when we rebuild rackin home we're gonna have to give we're gonna have to give the sewer or the sorry aquifer a very thorough cleaning thank you it's me yeah it's been pooped and bodied in a lot know that we can work with the fish people water says you're gonna be there like the janitors monsters for dragons alright guys well other than contaminated water I guess your handkerchief out normal smells I guess we'll start heading that like I mean let's take it slowly slowly and quietly mm-hmm traps I mean if we see anybody we just say yo we're from the What did he say purple petals yeah purple petals yeah we're purple petals so we're members of the purple petals that's what he said and we'll if we run into any other Queens man we'll just say that and we say that we're we're trying to get to the Queen because we want to we want to see the Queen's Arena hmm you know what maybe I might tie a bandana round my face like pull up my scar in my hood a little bit more just in case because I'm I've only got what probably 15 minutes left on my mm-hmm my spell so I'm gonna be a cat either way you can be kind of shadowy this is true I can finally be loud because I'm in a place where I think it's okay to be loud Mel really opened up my eye was like I can be myself here I can be loud and clunky and no one will say anything to me except you guys maybe you guys might having an identity crisis you must be Deb you head down the aquifers path as it gently on a slight downward incline moves deeper to the southwest the whole time just out of sight ahead of you is the body of the bear being carried down the current and it's he's a landmark now yes it is after about 12 minutes of travel there's a few other paths that it branches off on to you that go out into smaller side passages carrying water out in different directions and a few other connections here and there that bring it in from above but the main like walkable path continues forward until you come to ahead of you about 40 feet ahead of you as you look down the pathway the aquifer opens up into a larger sister it is roughly 60 feet wide and the water comes into a circular path with a large pillar that's supporting the ceiling and you can see that there are two more intersections that are that are all intersecting and from this distance it seems like one of them is carrying more fresh water in and then all these paths are connecting and then going out to the continuing to the center in this area there's a wider walkway around the circular path and you can see that the offshoots from the cistern Bowl there's no walkways going out so it goes basically under water and you can see that there's grates that have been put in front of the pathways from there but there are two large sealed storm doors here and you can see that there's a makeshift wooden bridge that has also been built across the cistern path as you come into the room the body of the bug bear hits kind of the bridge and just kind of stops there where it looks like a bunch of other refuse has collected against the this wooden bridge that has been built in place there and a pokemon der cool so give them a good poke to try to get them under the bridge yeah so here's what we'll do let's bring up our map cam because we actually have this build and it looks so pretty yeah you're you're you're going to poke the bear I'll be in the middle okay oh yeah there's traps down here so what you can see is that every way more Pluto is you come forward to the bridge to poke the bug bears body I don't know with your hand or your sword or your stick I'm gonna do it with a tap with my javelin okay you you kind of poke it and you can see that there are two doors the one directly across from you and another door another storm door here as well but there are three large leavers in this room one right beside the door across from you and then there's two other levers on the opposite end of the room at the opposite end of the cistern three levers two doors one body well he's poking the bugbear I start examining the water because I'm nervous about the room aired it was it alligators crocodiles alligators crocodiles indeed either crocodiles know so I'm observing the water as he's poking the bear to see if I see any movement the refuse had the refuse that's collected here has made the surface of the water very murky and dirty so it's difficult to see but you can give me a perception check sixteen looking down you can see at the base that the the wooden bridge under the water has a set of a so stick gate that is supporting the wooden bridge where a bunch of there's a bunch of netting underneath that is collecting all of these leftover body parts but you can see that a hole has been torn in the netting and dirt well there's a lot of like refuse and garbage and bone it's not a lot of flesh beyond the bunk there and they've been using this corpse hole for a while so this isn't good Pluto stop poking the bugbear ice I go fine I think I I think we might have Karaka Gators in the water somewhere keep your eyes peeled and your ears also peeled umm I see the door across from Pluto mm-hmm as I move up to be closer to Pluto kind of following him what's it made out of it is a storm door it is made of metal it looks like there's bits of wood that are reinforcing it yeah but this door and the way that it holds in place it looks like it has been it's been constructed by the looks of it's similar to those other storm doors that you encountered before in Drakon hein that they are meant to seal shot in case of flooding [Music] no wood though that I can see that my grapple shot could get although there's a bit of wood buttressing the whole thing and then there's the lever rate beside it as well okay so for the wood that's kind of around it mm-hmm I'm gonna zip over with my grapple shot okay so that way I don't have to go across that the wooden bridge bridge I don't trust a rickety bridges that have been in sewers and I try to open the door so the door has no handle oh yeah so I'm like the door has no handle it will not open try pushing I push on the door you push against it it must weigh a ton yep try pulling there's no handle I'm out of ideas go under it there this the door itself so you scratch it a little bit and there's some scratch marks in in the wooden metal of the door the other door on the opposite side is of identical construction but then there's the the three levers as well and the whole cistern its own so I pull the lever I'm gonna move up and what if we pull all the lovers at the same time I was gonna say that oh really yeah same brain Oh was I supposed to say that at the same time as you try again no were you actually gonna say I was I was thinking it well the worry that is I think one of the I think if I had to guess cuz I am guessing cuz I can't know is that that logic okay one of them might empty the water and then the other two might open the doors or one of them's a trap or they're all a trap or okay you can keep going forever like one of them could make jelly beans I don't know we have no idea no such thing is never that pull the mix jellybeans yeah that's insane you're insane I'm sorry it was a dumb idea hey come on knife get Pete get your head in the game okay I'm in the game I'm gonna keep my eyes on the water what do you guys think about the levees so if I went over and grabbed one and you you could mage and one true do you want to meet maintain the one that's that you'd have to jump over the water for yeah yeah so kudo maybe go around to the one near the other door so I'm gonna shimmy my way over cool and how how wide is the gap between the two it's is it ten feet like Ron Ridge roughly yeah the the gap is about ten feet and how deep could we say the water is can we see the bottom the water is about ten feet deep here you come that way yeah well you can all its murky water but with careful inspection you may be able to see the bottom I get down on all fours let me see no no I'm even wondering if there's anything inscribed here that might give a hint though which levers if I know anything about thieves can't is that I can't read it but I can go look for it and see if I can find scribbles yeah I'm looking for scribbles cool we're on my way to the lever okay as you head towards the lever give me a person give me an investigation check or perception yeah 23 okay you don't see scribbles but fruitless on the floor in front of you there is what looks like to be a clear it's like a hairline but it's a raised step in the flagstone in front of you I stop immediately and I do one of those crouching poses and then I okay we got a we got a problem why it's one of those is it look like it's cleaner than the other ones or it's dirtier than the other ones but it's obviously raised yep it's a it's a hairline break in the flagstones that's raised by maybe like a millimeter how close I might is stepping on it you were looking at carefully as you were moving forward so you're just one step away from it okay is there other ones like it there could be but based on how you detected it you would need to be this close to it before you even saw it what if I did if I took my javelin and I just kind of like kind of sweep it back and forth like not pressing down on it but did you feel for like the raises the bumps and uh yeah you feeling with your javelin it's one flagstone that sits flush from the edge of the water to the wall so it takes up the hole yeah that's how they get you are you telling us about what you found he's just like on the ground yeah I'm not saying anything I'm just like feeling around really intently I've already cast a mage hand and it's floating it looks it looks like I what's the range I lost my glasses Sebastian calyx your month you're playing our other campus ranges 30 feets okay so can I make it across the can I make it over it how can i is it how wide is it I know it goes the the hole from the water it is at least five feet wide okay stone the danger zone yeah okay so I'm going to tell you okay guys there's a raised thing here I think I found trap number one what does it look like it looks like all the other stones isn't that freaky could I be stepping on a dropper right now probably like look closely at the ground around me do I see any stones that are look for raised stones make me certain check what do you want don't see anything of the nature that he's described okay I don't see anything like that over here I need to move closer to for my mage hand to reach that lever I think I gotta cross this bridge yeah what's the worst that could happen no I step onto the bridge okay you step onto the bridge I examine the bridge it is rather rickety and I can't you examine it after you step on it then examine it nothing happens not yet no I whoa I like what was that [Laughter] ostrich I like you're that kind of like quick tiptoe we're like I'm trying to be gentle but I'm also kind of running and I run over to the other side Oh like in three ninjas strike back yeah yes just like that okay you've crossed the bridge as you cross the bridge you see that the it's like the water kind of goes up it's not very sturdy and it causes ripples all through the water yeah looking at the ground very carefully with each step I move that should go okay give me a perception check sixteen okay it seems fine as you look across as you look forward so when you step where you just stepped it's not fine and the you feel the flagstone that you just step on sink by an inch with a grinding sound and then all of a sudden on the wall opposite you as it sinks down a piece of flagstone in the wall sinks down as well revealing a nozzle guys there's a nozzle then all of a sudden there is a click click like someone's lighting a match guys there's an incident here what do you what are you gonna do I'm gonna barrel roll forward okay so as you barrel roll forward a burst of flame fires out from the wall it's like a gasoline fire it's like blue white-hot and red as it looks that it looks the tips you can give me a dexterity saving throw if you want to roll into the water I'll give you advantage yep remember what I said not yet 17 okay that's a successful save but you still take you still take 11 points of fire damage and you land in the water and I see a very large crocodile in front of you as I emerge from the water I yell croc a gator oh man it's big like right in front of me is it staring in the water this is basically you kind of look up and there it is roll for initiative what did you find you don't even have eyebrows a singe right now do you know they're going back well now they're probably gonna cab it is a gigantic horrifically mutated crocodile because you can see that there are bits and flecks of delirium that I've embedded in its flesh and it looks like underneath its reptilian scales it looks like almost it's scales are buckling to accommodate its gigantic growth in size like somehow the outer reptilian scales of the crocodile haven't grown fast enough to accommodate the increase in muscle mass and it's almost in parts of its back it's almost like there are tumorous growth growing off of it cool classic Sebastien there's an incident happening what do we got for initiative 26 26 for bayo 7 7 for sebastian and 13 for Pluto I rolled a cradle my Rose no I was thinking for wait there's there's other things on that list yeah there are because this is when merkel uno you notice hey I noticed something swimming up from the other passage are coming to more smaller crocodiles from here we got Co but but put them out off the map yeah they're swimming up but Polito can see them see as they surface up in the water coming forward alrighty top of the round I and I see this giant croc and your honor I take my bow and I'm like Sebastian I'll get you out of this incident and I start to take some shots cool so the crocodile is in the water and it's under it is under the water so I'm gonna give it cover but you ignore that because you're a sharp [ __ ] dude do you ignore like with yeah okay so you do ignore that yes yes okay okay and I bonus action Zephyr strike to get some advantage no what was that I'm flailing in the water 11 the arrows sing through the surface of the water but completely miss the crocodile yeah you know when you try to fire something in the water and it's like refracts and I'm like oh I need to move over a little bit no they'll shoot it not the water kill the water no seven it's okay it's okay my last shot what's the dice know how the tables turn the Vail fire so in a panic van turned sees the fire sees sebastian roll over as is Crockett and notices the crocodile in the water now and you just fire out a whole bunch of shots and they sing through the water and Sebastian under the water you can see like the arrows shooting and whistling past you underwater but they completely missed the crocodile that was a warning shot three times Ludo you're up I was reading about long jumps and it says that I could if I run for 10 feet I can jump my strength score in feet I can jump 20 feet yes I do that okay so you cycle back and I run and I'm gonna jump over the the thing okay and I'm gonna try I want to just get too too old Sebastian here and just pull them out of the water okay can I get to them without getting covered in fire is the fire still going the fire has stopped and the the whole system has closed up but you will have to step on the stone to reach them out of the water I do that okay does it has it recharged yes it has so as you step there the fire fires at once again as you try to lift Sebastian over the water I'm gonna grab him with my one arm and I'm gonna hold the shield up in a vain attempt to block the Knights fire coming out and I'm just gonna just I want to just grab them and do like like as you would handle a child with like a lifejacket just grab his like collar and just pull him in throw him backwards okay so first give me an athletics check to grab Sebastian and throw him out like a child you grab a 23 okay so you grab Sebastian under the water and throw him out onto the ground behind you okay so now it's something like that you're holding your shield up if you take disadvantage on your saving throw you will be able to protect protect Sebastian from the flames as you pull in that I accept okay what's a deck save yeah I got a 16 and a 20 so I got 17 and 21 so miraculously though you you're using the shield to try to shield yourself and Sebastian at the same time so it's really difficult but you managed to wriggle your body around and pull it back blocking most of the flames with the shield still some of them lick around the the flames so Sebastian you can make a dexterity saving throw with advantage against it because he took disadvantage forget it 17 and because he's shielding you I'm gonna say that you take no damage on a successful save you still end up taking 10 fire damage it's a it's warm it's a it's a little hot but I take it ok you just saved my life and then I'm gonna do I have anymore movement you used all your movement and that was your action and I'm standing on the fire yeah cool ok that's ok next up is the giant croc it lurches forward as you throw Sebastian out of the way the crocodile lurches forward towards you pollute oh and as it comes around it tries to sweep your leg with its tail that's my move getting a 26 to hit oh yeah baby [Laughter] you take 17 points of bludgeoning damage and I need a strength saving throw or you're gonna be knocked prone 17 you're good you need 16 was what you're looking for however the crocodile without sweeping your leg it comes up to grab you in a vise grip with its mouth uh-oh that's [ __ ] die getting a critical hit I don't take crits but it's still we don't accept crits we don't even get out so as the vicious jaw bite comes down were you not wearing the armor made of the adamantium your iron made by Tobias crow you would probably be missing your most of you I love that part of me the most of me that's what makes me me I'm already having enough of an identity crisis if this crocodile eats me know who I am regardless you still take 26 points of piercing damage and you are grabbed by the crocodile ow and then we're gonna make an opposed strength check is it's gonna try to pull you in the water but I'm super strong I'm Caspian strong strong I got a 22 I got a 15 so it tries to pull you in grit your teeth into the pressure plate if I just stand here yep cool so that you're up alright yeah I think this is happening okay so I'm I've just been pulled out of the water I'm heaving and soaked on the sidelines here and I look up just to see this alligator biting down on Pluto who is getting flames burst at em and I stand up and start kind of looking at the whole scene and I get really angry and I'm like no you leave Pluto alone and then all of a sudden I kind of hunched over and I'm like I don't I don't feel good and then my skin explodes and a shadowy ape appears your poly working yourself into a giant ape yeah only the ape kind of explodes out of my skin is the shadow a giant ape with red eyes and it's just purely made of like shadow and evil essence there's sebastian skin yeah it's not a skin just like you don't even see it anywhere it's not a not a true giant eight mini but it's pretty close pretty close yeah works with it so assassins form just monstrously explodes out as he transforms himself into a horrific beast although one relatively still animal intelligence although you're half as much GFE you're fine though that's your action to poly more correct yeah okay anything else you want to do with your turn the confused a pashtun just pounds his chest and yours every alligator okay yeah I'm trying it yeah okay a bastion he said yes sir Junaid sir EEP I think it's just a passion a passion trial trainer here alrighty thanks next up our tiny Crocs they're gonna swim forward around the long way yeah how far today they're gonna have to - swim towards giant eight but then two more Crocs swim up this way and begin climbing up onto the platform that is the little baby Crocs you go to top with bail okay so I see this giant ape bursts out in front of me no after what happened to my friend there Pluto you're getting eaten by a croc I turn into karate and I start to freak out a little bit i activate my feline agility coupled with my zephyr strike and they start to run towards the opposite side you want to go all 90 oh yeah okay and then I take my long bow out and I start shooting the little Crocs in the butt okay so you run to the that that side in the process so you step on the on the pressure plate oh and the little Crocs are YouTube's ever strike up so you don't provoke opportunity attacks okay they would try to snap at you but the pressure plate does go off and out of flame fires out towards you as well make your next arity saving throw yeah that works 9 so that's a failure by five or more and the explosion of flame deals 27 points of fire damage that's just like you need fire crime and because it's such a powerful blast of flame it's actually concussive and it blasts you towards the water so you can make one last-ditch dexterity saving throw with this advantage to catch yourself before you're thrown into the water 12 you are pushed into the water [Music] now what would you like to do I'm gonna crawl back up sopping wet can you make a concentration check for a zephyr strike yes you've got to make a DC 14 with the damage that you took okay so it's still in effect okay so you're able to climb out zephyr strike still in effect so you don't provoke opportunity X from the croc I have I'm gonna say that climbing out is gonna cost at least 15 feet of movement okay use about forty to get there yeah and then 15 there so it's like 55 issues I think it's all about 40 left I stuff like 40 I moved 30 feet it's just like like have you ever seen though what happens to a cat when it freaks out and you try to push it in a bathtub like they just go oh yeah yeah I always picture like you're like you were like fan out and then you fell into the water and it startled you yeah those videos like when the cats like try to run it jumps wipes out and then runs away so hi do I know now where the spot is yeah you do okay you do I wanna not climb up there not climb up there but also just like hop and roll over it it's worse I can go okay so I probably can't go another 40 feet but at least I can get past the flames okay and now I'm stopping by big I think I hate sewers there yeah if you want to do okay and I leaned up against the wall like that's better you ran so far anything else it okay Pluto you're up um he still got me in his mouth or did I resist am I like he's got you he's got you in the grab yeah Oh yep and you are standing on that pressure plate and is it still like firing fire at me it isn't I said like oh but is it like I'm since you're still standing on it it hasn't read it now hasn't reset okay I'm just gonna start swinging at the croc that's what heroes do okay well I yeah I'm gonna I'm just gonna reach behind me pull out my sword and then just in one motion 19 that is a hit for 15 damage oh wow again like 24 for 11 damage and then I'm gonna do distracting strike and do another eight damage okay and the next attack against them has advantage and then I'm gonna action surge and just keep swinging twenty five four nine damage Wow and yeah like a 22 415 damage that leaves the croc bloodied so with a flurry just driving your javelin sort your sort just driving the blade down on it you see er truck like almost ripping away sheets of its scales and like you hit one of the tumors on its back and it just explodes into pus and the creature howls and bites down deeper on you as you do so and with you're able to take the bite and pull it into the path of the next attack coming at it and then the last on my last attack I'm gonna do a trip attack okay and I don't know if he can be pruned he can be knocked prone oh well then I do that and he's gonna take another six damage okay and it needs to make us strength save I get a natural one so he is knocked prone does he let me go he doesn't let you go oh you've kind of knocked him against the side but just ease ease prone doesn't mean it breaks his the grip of his jobs okay yeah and then I'm gonna use a bonus action and heal myself all the second wins yeah cool alrighty so next up is the giant croc the croc writes itself and thrashes at you first I've earned this trying to slam you with its tail getting a twenty six to hit scrap means it is hit so hard each time yeah slamming you with its tail for eighteen points of damage and I need a strength soon you get knocked prone so you know how that is the crocodiles or alligators that do like the alligator roll thing I don't know is it alligators they both do it Thank You Kyle so it gets knocked over and it tries to do that whole like roll with its prey make a strength saving throw no seventeen it rolls over rolls back but you don't go down nevertheless it still drives its teeth in like a vice grip getting a 24 to hit that hits me Wow for 28 points I'm super down are you down oh yeah I had for help okay 28 yeah it's so ed since you've gone down it still got you in in his jaws and Sebastian you see it pull Pluto down and I'm just as I'm thrashing it with my sword it's just pulling me into the water and you just see me like stop swinging so it's my turn now yeah so a pashtun seeing Pluto get dragged into the water and going limp lets out a huge roar and reaches into the water and grabs the alligator by the jaw and I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna use my punch attack but I'm just imagining that I reach in and I just grab them you say that because you're elevated over it I'm gonna give you advantage on you tackle maybe actually and you have advantage because Pluto's distracting strike is still in place so I get super advantage does my elven accuracy still apply no because your your innate better inside and even deeper your knife get Pete yeah all right well I got a nineteen to hit that hits and so I grabbed it by the jaw and start trying to rip its head off oh yeah that's a head rip and move 23 Oh 29 damage wow it's still alive but bit so you punch it in the back and you hear this loud crack as a bunch of its ribs break and just parts of its scales burst out sending blood all through the water I get it like under my arm and I start trying to like cry its mouth open off of dying Pluto okay do I still have advantage yep yeah $19.99 25 more damage so your second punch you punch it the first time sending your other fist into it you punch it a second time and just rip it in and these bits of giant croc go flying all through the water and Pluto with the Crocs jaws still attached to him floats to the surface and I as like a would it would it be a free action can I like grab Pluto with my big ape arms and like just crazy or Adam you're gonna need to take an action you could move into the water to interpose yourself between him and the other Crocs though I do I like put myself in their cool with little Pluto well you can pull the flames away for now because they're not going and you're able to move in the water such that you don't have to you yeah oh thank you thank you so much it best eat a pass he passed the ceiling here is about 15 feet high so as an as a giant ape you really got a stoop well now I'm in the water so now you're fine okay okay it's just up to you like your waist yeah yeah cool so that was clawed that was Sebastian so now my little tiny croc so they haven't movement speed of 30 feet so they're gonna swim up to vayo those two because they landed beside her so they're gonna swim right up to her the other two are gonna swim up to eight Bastian a cool and two of the crocodiles are gonna bite eight Bastian getting an 11 and a 20 to hit the 20 hits and that is gonna be ten piercing damage I'm gonna say that it technically does grapple you and it's biting onto your leg but you're way too big for it to actually grab you the other two smaller Crocs go for veo getting a 19 and a 20 yeah it's kind of just stuck on me it's like so they oh that's gonna be 22 points of damages the two Crocs leap up out of the water and go for your legs and you're grabbed by both of them quite agree who's gonna get you in who's not oh okay okay we go to the top of the round with Vail they're grappling me yep all right I want to try to grapple and I need a concentration check for Polly more yeah I got 20 you good good nice huge acrobatics as opposed to their stranger 20 so you got to make too so you beat one and you definitely beat the other because I get it my first role I got it I got it a 19 and my second role I got a natural one oh okay because I got a nine so it's your action you managed to break out of both their grips now what are you gonna do extra movement here don't you aren't you under the effects of it already yes but the movement only does one so if I want to do the I see it so to get that extra 30 feet I cast it okay and I hop over the croc pop the rock and keep running around to the corner avoiding the trap this time uh can I jump over it yeah yep kind of do a barrel roll yep end on the corner and I'm like okay well I'm back what's happening and I'm somewhere under the water I'm just laying in the water speaking of which death saving throw do I get any bonuses what you what is it is it a con or no it's just a straight-up saving throw a nine that's one failed death save don't roll on next turn or you're dead [Music] that's my first one right yeah okay I lay there okay so the Pluto the giant croc is dead Sebastian you're up I'm going to grab the crocodile that's on my leg mm-hmm and here's how I want to describe it and you tell me if I just make two standard attacks or if there's something else I would love to grab the ally the crocodile that's biting my leg lift them up and smash the other crocodile with them okay let's resolve this in order so grab the first crocodile and make your attack making just fist attack yep 23 that hits give me the dance so you go down to sweep up this crocodile and smash it into the other with your fist and roll the attack against the other croc crit okay so now what we're gonna do is I'm gonna have your world of damage and I'm gonna describe you what happens roll today all three attacks for the first for the first attack first attack is 18 okay nice and the other one the crit so that's 14 15 16 17 33 plus 6 39 so both attacks individually kill the Crocs but what's gonna happen is you you reach down grab the first one by the tail rip it up smash it into the other and they both break apart in a shower of gold you smash them against the wall and crocodile parts go everywhere eight bash a pashtun lets out another mighty roar and pounds his chest nice little tiny Crocs they swim to one swims towards veo the other I don't think has enough movement to get towards mayo and get her it packs so it leaps out of the water actually yeah it has to dive back in go for you and it it comes out of the water as it does so they'll to come and attack you it hits the pressure plate and it fails at saving throw croc firebrand it gets cooked yeah the other croc swims forward and I gotta say this other croc seeing what's happening it's gonna slither off and flee so veo if you have a healing potion on you you can definitely get up to Pluto and recover him the the other crocodile is gonna run okay because I totally forgot that I can bonus action cunning action - so I was gonna - over to Pluto and I use my healers kit oh so I don't have to use a potion X I have six uses now left on it Wow this can hit bashed-in reach the crocodile trying to flee or does he get away yeah a passion could yeah he runs up and rips it in half nice okay with that what are all y'all gonna do do you want to take a short rest I'm gonna lay here because I can use a rope trick to get us out of the sewer - yeah we can you just kind of chill just resting while I'm like walking around in this pool as a giant ape for a while I'm like lashing and stuff not on the pressure plate that is probably right beside me but I'm leaning against the wall after like healing Pluto just being sopping wet and like thank you thanks for saving me guys eventually I turned back into Sebastian and I feel weird about what just happened now do your clothes like rip or is it is it like the Hulk or is it like like is your does everything like kind of morph into more like Shazam yeah it's kinda like Josh's hamed night into a shadow ape and then but like it looks violent like it looks like the ape explodes out of me but then when it turns back it's just like an awkwardly frail-looking Sebastian who looks just tired I almost picture like black flames that kind of come around shadowy yeah and now I'm sitting on the edge and I'm just like guys I was weird what happened I don't know I got really scared that you were going to die and then everything was kind of just a haze of me ripping crocodiles and alligators ripping and tearing and biting and smashing are you okay yeah thanks yeah sorry man I just got really worried about you I appreciate you helping because that crocodile was eating me alive was that a new spell I don't know I think so cool became an ape did you guys become Apes no what was that the trap I became a wet cat cool I became dinner well then I'll just store that in my back pocket for later remember how that felt and channel that your I still picture you're like laying there like just yeah I'm just talking like not moving there's still a part of a crocodile kind of on me yeah get this job yeah if I don't wants to just move that judge like right into my oh there we go so do you want to do I can do a rope trick and we can that'd be great rest do short rest okay yep so Baio cast rope trick and you all hide up

let's return to the ruins we are underneath the city of dragon hime where our heroes have followed the path of the what is known as the Queen's passage the old smuggler tunnels that run beneath the spokes of Drakon hime that allegedly are filled with traps and crocodiles although several fewer crocodiles now and may lead to the stronghold of the queen of these our heroes have been brooder brutally beaten down after a confrontation with several Crocs and have headed up into vales rope trick to recuperate and now as the hour passes you drop out of the rope trick and are still in the cistern much quieter than it was before as the carcasses of the crocodiles float further downstream so you're gonna be on the one across for the right back to the first plan we're gonna pull two believers we're gonna pull all three at once and I'm not stepping past this point bear please like Sebastian no no stop how this happened last time I'm also not human anymore oh yes you Pluto can you make your way to the other lever without stamping stepping on any uh be very careful yeah I'm I was thinking like let's mark them can we mark them with something can you like mark them with magic can I use mold earth to put like don't step here I go around like in gravel yeah yeah yeah like a big circle with the line through yeah about circles with lines through it on the squares not to step on okay so you're gonna mage hand that one yeah I'm gonna be the one closest to us okay oh no wait so we still don't know what they all do like do we do them like one two three and like see what each of their reactions are or do we do them all at once so we do them the fun part about all at once is that we do it all at once are there any inscriptions anywhere does anybody see any inscriptions above their levers I look at my lever and see there there's the evidence that there was a instructional plate or plaque of some kind which has been deliberately removed is one of the levers look like they've never been pulled well you're looking at one of your lovers right now does it look like it's commonly pulled does it have wear like on the handle or is it just like cool make an investigation checking five you got no idea well it's gonna feel it now I'm gonna hold the lever and I'm gonna let's time it we're going the same time okay all right three two one okay you pull all the levers down simultaneously and there is a creaking noise as all of a sudden another nozzle the wall on the opposite side from vayo opens up and a crossbow whops down and fires at bay oh no getting a a 22 hit there yep there you take four you take six points of piercing damage and give me a constitution saving throw Oh No what if it's got what's that 23 okay you succeed so you only take six points of poison damage and are not poisoned for one hour oh geez look over to you guys I'm like hey cuz we're back to it and with all the levers pulled you see the the two doors they kind of rise up and then slammed back down again with all the levers in the down position so the doors just only opened a bit and then closed yep like they were gonna go up and then just slam right down so do we do all them but the arrow on well you you looked at yours and you couldn't tell if it was worn yeah I want to look at mine and see if it was also worn cool make your perception check 21 you see now where you're standing there are several old bloodstains in front of this lever and the clear evidence that like people have been shot in the back fallen over and Crocs have come up and dragged them into the water it's a system and it works the system works yeah like it probably hasn't happened for a while but but now looking at it like looking at the stains on the floor it's very obvious yes I you're like like you have the recreation in your head I take my lover and I put it down alright I put up you put the lever back up okay that's the crossbow go away the crossbow got goes away when her lever goes back up so we're not pulling that one anymore I pull walk away I pull my lever again you its debt in the down position I put it up you put it back up okay with your lever up and the other lever down what happens is the door beside pollute o opens up switch yeah we switch the door beside you to opens up wait a second I have an idea I'm Old Earth and pile some rock just because the door opens up and down right I pile some rock here so that we could still fit through but it would be high enough to wedge the door open there's no like loose stone like there I mean you could get some of the wooden debris but like unworked stone is not president yeah we just here at the switches I was just trying to come up with a fun solution for both doors to be open I like where your head's at which door do want to go through first as the professional navigator I said no it's not you oh stop stop stop thank God because I had no idea I was I was just gonna make a like 50/50 choice here damn yeah you know the one door the other scenario yeah I mean this one's open right now what a navigator okay we you know what our navigators never let us astray right food never led us astray no rat ever let its astray oh this new navigator just via beos never let us salute was good for them what about that time she like told us to run across the street as fast as we could and we ended up in a situation with Knowles yeah we we you hesitated yeah we probably didn't run fast enough maybe you just over estimate our ability to follow her I do navigate based on my own ability so yeah there's an expectation Pluto so I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna step over the already I do a little skip yep what's through this door whatever it is it's gonna die I'm really mad there's there's like bite marks in my armor I'm gonna keep some of the teeth as like a as a trophy okay I'm gonna walk through the door okay you walk through the door into a dry dusty hallway that heads back some thirty feet before veering both to the north and south but not on a perfect t-intersection like it's disjointed in its in its shape one way the way that leads back towards the north the way you came ends in a pair of large wooden double doors that look like they probably haven't been opened in years the other passage ends in a staircase which leads up upwards judging by the way the staircase is built and its sharpness of its incline the stairs are going over top of the water passage that's coming off a cistern and I say Bluto hold on a sec you said it's dusty right mm-hmm I take a look at the floor and I want to see if there's any footprints or anything going through the dust that have been here that I can tell good thinking give me an investigation check in 15 looking around it does not appear that anyone has come this way in quite some time I say we if this was the way that they came to go to the Queen they said there are men that come through here often I don't think this is the way yeah but we could also just take a quick look around I say a nice step through the door as well I agree with you we shouldn't go this way but why not well I mean we're following we're trying to follow the path at the yeah we need to find but I mean I see a pair of double doors that might be fun to open it could be more traps true I didn't think of that I just like opening doors okay we can go back we can always keep in mind that this is something to come to later - if we lose our way if we don't go the right way nice comeback do you want to go upstairs or go check out the other doors I say check out I say check out the other doors I'd like to see if there's like investigate for ya just see if there's been people walk yeah because if they're coming every day or every other couple of days like this amount of dust has probably been a little bit more than just a couple weeks so people haven't come by no smart yeah so let's go back we'll do the the old reverse we have the markings okay you reverse the doors looking through them this is a short straight passage that has a t-shaped intersection to it directly ahead of you is a wall that looks like of almost completely different construction so the room directly across from you is a rough basement across on the other side of this great and you can see a staircase leading upwards and there's several stacked crates barrels and other accoutrements filling the room across from you the hallway connecting this room to the cistern veers off to the south though as well so there's a t-shaped hallway that goes to the zone and I step forward to again kind of look at the floor and see if there's any patterns if there's any dust here that shows there's some people walking through cool give me a perception check we're no 10/10 the hallway doesn't look quite as dusty as the other one but whether or not that means that just it it's more sealed off or it has frequent foot traffic you can't tell I mean this doesn't look as the other one but why don't you take the left wall I'll take the right wall we'll kind of just kind of work our way down four nozzles and checking for raised stones okay you slowly move down the hallway to the T intersection the intersection goes to the south before ending abruptly in a solid wall and across from you is a is a gate it's a barred gate and you can see that this small bit of masonry that goes between here is transitional like someone's carved it out so there's rough stone as if so the the room across from you might be the basement or a cellar of another building above ground and this little bit has been broken through and then a gate a portcullis style gate has been put through it to block it all and and this South passage just goes to a wall yes and so how far down thirty feet so just thirty feet and then just a wall just a walk it's so suspicious maybe it's not just a wall maybe it's more than a wall I sing it I look down the hallway and before I go down it I check for gelatinous cubes yeah is it super clean is the ground super clean no the ground is actually dusty and looking around you can see now that there looks to be a fair amount of foot traffic but then the foot traffic heads from this gate down this hallway and then the foot traffic good like the bits of disturbed dust abruptly end about ten feet down the hallway in the last like 10 15 feet of the hallway why don't you use your main chain I'm just like punch through it hoping my mage hand is strong you just think see if you're like I I walked to the end of the footprints okay and I examined the ground around that area so you're standing at the edge of the footprints and the ground below there's a notice there's still dust there in fact the dust is thicker after the footprints stop I look above me solid wall solid ceiling up there they check the walls I start like pushing up against walls go on the other side of you being like what are we doing I'm miming the whole you push against the walls they are cold to the touch you keep keep keep walking or use your masion and like make it go where the footsteps can I think I know what's happening here I walk confidently into the wall which wall the one straight ahead him toward it towards you okay do you step forward put your foot down and your foot stops about six inches above the ground I continued to walk confidently upwards on these invisible stairs yeah it's an invisible staircase I'm watching Sebastian levitate into the air and I'm freaking out man yeah more magic that's happening to you like the ape yeah I don't actually know but I I think so you've walked up the stairs yeah and now your heads almost at the ceiling I continued to walk watches Sebastian's head goes through the ceiling well we lost we need another sorcerer way I saw you turn into an API I think you levitating and then your head disappearing as well it's normal this is this is normal stuff now all my time I'd record I'm I've never seen someone had just disappear like that no his head is going through the wall and he's just you see his torch right so the torso turns back around and I yell down you guys coming oh you're okay I'm coming yes yeah I feel more confident and I'm like feeling on all fours I'm kind of going up these stairs I usually wall you can see that there it ends very quickly in a wooden door at the a at the end of the staircase basically where this at the top of the stairs there's this wooden door that will be right there I listen into the wooden door assumption check a perception check I get a seven it's quiet it's quiet - do you hear the door I hear wood and stone and possibly mischief but that might be my imagination what oh is that you sorry you guys still have your disguises right I'm wearing a bandana I also put up a little bit tighter on my face and my bandana over my mouth feel like okay we're seeing cream in like let's go through I'm gonna put my face mask down I put my goggles on yeah this disguise is complete and I'm now Clark Kent I don't even know you your human disguises and help disguise as a as a thief that also sometimes becomes if you head up the stairs yes okay so you were all at the top of the stairs in front of this doorway I try to open the door wait this is going to be bad all oh sorry - the door there's just small landing at the top of the stairs after the doorway and looking behind you it just looks like floor I I like kind of put my hands out to these guys and I kind of I back us up a little bit so we're like on the steps and then I mage hand open the door okay you mage hand open the door and it opens into a large rectangular room and as the door flies open you hear the black black black of several crossbows being fired at the door swinging open because in this room are a pair of large tables that have been overturned and then there are a pair then there are a group of hooded figures holding crossbows behind tables that have all fired them at you as you open the door I'm gonna have you all roll for initiative and if you can help me for one moment well we just slide around so you can access the battlefield thank you very much for watching our set change we will now play the dragon - dragon that was bad I think we're gonna sing the song from the I I can't remember yelled it you nailed it nailed it don't forget the camera [Music] oh we're way over there don't you worry over there yeah Monty last thing Minnie's we're just getting ready to die please stay tuned will our heroes be able to survive three bolts from crossbows find out next time right now what's uh what's Pluto Jackson's favorite color blue okay at the door out the door and if you can put these four behind there and you put them all behind the tables they're great your head reason that I play maybe we should have like stayed in the illusionary stairs and opened the door hindsight 20/20 wonderful said knock oh yeah yeah we're new to the club we didn't know the secret oh yeah we're old world initiative mm-hmm I really really go have another finish on I I'm going last all night that's what's happening my last initiative I rolled a crit 20 I just rolled on 19 of course you did think I'm cool you got a good camera shop there cow gonna adjust it a little yeah I think so tilt it down just a little bit on the camera itself nice nice okay so you kick down the door and quite suddenly here's what you see you see a very hastily erected barricade has been knocked over tables and barrels has been set up in here and then alongside them are four figures all of them are wearing black cloaks and you can see that all of them have a motif of like our red rose somewhere on their armor or weapons there are four of them two of them are teeth wings and all of them carry crossbows daggers and wear light leather armor their equipment is noticeably better than the other thugs that you've seen before in terms of its quality and its uniformity and three of them have leveraged crossbow shots beside them and fired the and fire them upon one of each of you as you each enter the room now we are back a bit and crouched at the stairs and we mage hand open the door does that give us any sort of cover and yes I'm gonna give you cover on your shots yeah so veo you actually get a crit crit Sebastian I get a you can add you can all add five to your AC because you're crouched down Sebastian I get a 23 they'll to hit you I cast shield okay and Pluto I get a 21 that thankfully misses okay you don't have special armor okay so they oh you're gonna be taken total of ten points of damage from the crossbow shop I'm a very high crit Sebastian yeah piercing you take six points of damage I cast shield though oh you cast shield yeah okay and great that's all I need then from the okay finding and finally the as all of this rustles up the one tiefling woman she's got all of them have their bandanas drawn across her face but you can just see by her eyes she's a tiefling you can see in in just this moment she grabs her hands together and three duplicates of her appear out around the sides of her and what we got for initiative there's a million of them 25:25 for mayo okay pluto 13 leaders got a 13 and Sebastian for four nights four okay so Sebastian's going to go dead last as I do okay here's the plan shoot them that's magic them that's right yeah let's go with your new it's my I'm trying to reason on my second turn with the one where you don't get it later literally shoot them all and then be like look they have a meeting with destiny you're just okay so should be tea flings these things are named lies and deceit and there are two allies are named Soros so Sebastian is gonna go dead last and then as I do we got lie and then the sorrows go ahead of him and then lies and deceits so veo is the first one to go and then yeah we got the seat lies and sorrows they're fast it's so fast okay they'll what are you gonna do how how not invisible that how much covered are we you have 3/4 cover basically so kind of like our heads are putting up on the stairs that's a good shot I'm gonna take a shot against the sorrows one of the guys behind the barrels not the peopling not the tea place okay and I take my three shots okay turn good well you fire me on fire so nine it hits the wooden table in front of him seventeen that does hit Oh baby you go a hundred damage I think that's all in one that's it let's spread it out let's have a hundred damage over four targets okay twenty-one damage and then my third shot that leaves him bloodied okay so he cannot survive a critical hit from you so the first shot most of the heat he recoils exactly at your first shot and steps out of cover and right into your second bullet which hit summary right between the eyes and he falls over dead nice okay okay but I'm still like right below so you guys not running away all right so deceit deceit was one of the is the tiefling man the man of the male tiefling and he seeing the shots and seeing one of his friends go down he leaps forward around to the side where this leaver is and you hear him pull it and all of a sudden there is a screeching noise coming from the staircase as the sound of a portcullis is closing across the illusory floor so you have a choice so veil you've already ducked back down two of you have a choice whether you want to go up or down again bears down though today I was down what it so Sebastian goes I I jump up at the sir gonna jump forward I jump forward okay the two of you can make dexterity saving crows 11 2011 and 27 you succeed gluto you do not and you do manage to pull yourself up and forward but as the you can feel that sliding through the illusion are these spear points that are coming and they close Wow the illusionary door shut and you take a total of 14 points of damage now there it is a floor and it is or it is a ceiling don't worry bear said she's not leaving she's just gonna be right back and she's right there she'll be fine okay what happened right with that lies her eyes turn inky black and she begins circling her hand in a wide circle forming a coiling spiral of magical energy and casts hypnotic pattern no I hold out my hand or no I pull out my wand and I pointed out her and I go no and a beam comes out of my wand and tries to counter spell okay oh so that matches the spells evenly so her hypnotic pattern is counterspell ooh I twirl the wand and slide it back into my pocket it's not very impressive to me because nothing happened even though a bunch of stuff happened I didn't see anything happen I saw her going like this and you saw me on the ground finally Soros lies sees this and she turns to the other the other one of the two saw rose and she says get over your brother and shut that door and sore and then saw rose leaps forward towards the door and slams it shut hey you hear a clink as it locks into place just in the closet now how can you pull it oh you're up it's a wooden door right I'm gonna go through the door I'm just gonna pretend like it's not there and wherever Sarah was I'm just gonna run at him okay so I run into the door as hard as I can and I'm just gonna burst through it okay make a strength check 9 the door is very real with a Bosch and but it does not give way uh-oh it's a real door oh no and before it opened right try again do you have more turn left I just try to turn the handle it turns but it's it's closed from the other circuit all right well what do you want to do now oh well I'm all out of ideas I think we're gonna need a bigger Pluto and he starts to grow you cast enlarge on pollute oh yeah okay we go to the top of the round with Vail the top of the stairs mm-hmm down here I I'm ready myself as I'm like no no they'll get through they all don't open the door and I get my longbow ready so that way if if I I'm kind of like poking it to see if the illusion is done like bad they'll get it and then if the illusion comes out I'm gonna pop up she realize is that what's cut close across is a great so you can kind of like hook your fingers through and you can hear Vail I just let you out is it like when your archives under the door and you see a hand like yeah okay thanks for the vote of confidence I can shake then okay so you hear some muffled you hear the voice go lay down your arms and surrender and we won't kill you okay we're from the purple were from the purple I'm all like big and like in the hallway or in the door purple what are we house pedals we're from the purple pedals down this ain't your turf pet pedals yeah we got lost Mel sent us here you know BJ Mel blackjack Mel hit deception Jack to buy the lucky I think you were the you were those boys that beat up a bunch of us in the streets a few weeks ago okay lies and sorrows pass their turns what do you do blue I used my newfound strength to open the door successfully this time all right do it to it you get advantage on that string 23 so you kick the door off its hinges and it goes flying into the room colliding with sorrow yes I make it attack roll against sorrows with the door 9 okay so Rose manages to dive out of the way as the door goes flying off its hinges but as you crash forward into the room just remove the door it's total as as you crash forward into the room lies cast lightning bolt oh no at me ed both of you because you're both in a line we're in a big line i counterspell okay a lot of you saying a lot of words she goes and she fires a lightning bolt and you absorb it through the one cool she looks very perturbed okay was it my action to kick the door in it was your action okay that was her ready to action yep would you like to move or do anything else blue I run into the room and I'm gonna like I'm gonna get after kicking the door I just run right up to the guy that put the cool the thing on me oh that closed the door Sebastian Europe so I run into the room as well and I'm going to hold out my ring of spell story and put a little force bubble over the over deceit okay alrighty yes that happens so you create a wall a domed wala force over over deceit which is this or loss over lies okay put it over lies nice and I'm like you're staying there I have questions for you okay and that was anything else um I'm actually going to let's see that was my can I quick in a spell stored ring you you are casting the spell so I'm going to allow this I mean either way I think I'm just gonna do a can trip okay weird so what it was quick and one of them I'm just going to well double check I think it's the same thing as we've done with the scroll yeah that is Ken did your cat hounds casting a spell yeah I'm fine okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna fire bolt Sora's yeah that is an 18 that hits so a beam of fire flies out hits him in the face oh that's 2d 10 not doing 9 damage nice very well okay uh we go to the top around there who still locked out I'm now he's getting louder you know when you don't let a cat into the room and they just get more obnoxious you'll get it right okay so we go to deceit he says so this is how it's gonna be then a fine and he he loops around to using his movement he squeezes between the two of you behind you yep and sorro's finds his footing and as you drive your blade down into one of the two sorrows deceit kind of tactical rolls behind you Pluto takes out one of hit one of his blades and drives them down your back making three attacks Oh getting a 22 hits a 21 and a 20 okay so the three walks ooh each deal 1026 points of piercing damage across the three attacks okay and then another 14 damage and sneak attack for 40 damage total ow I'm real bloody together and then he and then Soros Soros follows through and as he drives the blades out of your back he pushes you towards suros whoo nice you in the gut Hey but sorrows only gets a hand to hit and doesn't penetrate through your armor and then I stabbed him with repost okay 15 that hits or 17 damage coming forward you bring your blade down on his skull and it caves in stop it stop everyone stop stabbing me for like a second oh okay and next we go to pollute Oh searcher is pulling a lever an action it's your interaction so I'm gonna just start wailing I'm gonna just turn around and I just glare at lies mm-hmm after he stabbed me a bunch of times and then I just repeat her lies that's deceit sorry to see you everybody everybody just stop stabbing me and moving around and I start wailing on him and I crit him and I dude 20 damage and then I'm also going to distracting strike him so he takes another three okay and then I'm gonna hit him again and oh yeah I hit him for another 13 damage oh and then I'm gonna slam them with my shield into the wall getting at 13 yeah you slam him back and then uh and I go stop it and I'm gonna run over and pull the lever nice cuz you pushed him away yep and you pull the lever yeah and it's sly and then it slides open as well as the other two portcullises along the side here slide open as well there you hear it she slide open and then how much movement did I use how far do they move there old Sebastian one five ten yeah and I'm gonna run back over to you cool alrighty huh oh and I'm gonna heal myself does that hurt Sebastian you're up second one juice here I'm going to just throw a fire bolt at deceit okay he's right beside you so you do have disadvantage he was pushed away oh yeah he was and you have advantage because I distracted them nice I'm going Hey look at me oh that's completely the other way yeah there we go there's a wiff advantage Hey look at me look at me like a man I get to reroll one of those cuz elven accuracy that doesn't make it better so I get a 27 you're like that doesn't make it better when you still get a 27 okay it hits a head so I blast him in the face with a fireball doing 10 damage leave some bloody nice okay top of the round with ale there's torch light illuminating this room in the hallway - in the hallway was the only lit by whatever light that you had okay so I and I'm like ready for this I'm like thank you I've released the the veil [Laughter] and shoot him in the back oh man oh yeah nineteen that hits oh yes they'll please he stabbed me in the back so many times 18 damn it invisible in the darkness well yeah that's always good so okay okay I think he saw wasn't there there yeah yeah and also the illusionary wall is still there so she would need to come up through the wall we're going to see him yeah but I raised up out of the wall 18 damage start pelting him in the background he is still alive and then I sneak back down but make their extremely wounded yeah yes I go back down almost like it okay with that he collapses to his knees and says please don't kill me we surrender we surrender I'm gonna walk up and pick him up by his throat and just raise him off the ground and I don't know what should I say you say I I actually turned him to you I pick him up and I just started to you go you can interrogate him man where's the Queen she'sshe's on the other other end of these passages which direction there's two ways you could go back up that way she's also got an office down on the other side has a man by the name of Oscar yarn come through here any time soon don't know anyone by that name oh I popped my head up in the floor like only so using the head I'm like did we win yeah I think you can come up now I hop up the steps how long is the cage last that's a great question I don't know what that spell does I just put it around her because she might be Sebastian doesn't understand why covers and it lasts ten minutes so this is who am i holding on to to see to see deceit and lies deceit either you get away you can pull off like his face masks and he is a a blue skinned tiefling man with short buzzed hair and his horns kind of shoot up in a spiral like straight up and he had to he had a scowl over his face which underneath is very like sharp and well-defined features but almost facial features that are too sharp like the angles on his face are almost just like perfect angles not like rounded soft features what did he say your name was I go by deceit some reason that doesn't make me want to trust you yeah what what's your friend's here his name she's lies are they what if they're not telling the truth about their names can we even trust that complicated not gonna give a give you our real names not a chance that's fine you know tell you other things do you know the Queen personally yes we do she assigned us to watch this passage were you way to keep all their traps were working were you waiting for us we heard you yelling and we're prepared wait oh yeah there were some alligators worthy we're the ones that keep the traps in this area while maintained they worked really well good glad to hear it also I think I'm gonna need that and I go up to the symbol that he has of the red rose and I take it off like just in case not gonna do much good queen of thieves knows everyone's faces that's fine it's dead fool your lesser intelligent we wouldn't and remember disguise yourself as him I could do that if I let's take a minute to memorize his face can we take like a several hour break laissez you think you're gonna trick the queen of thieves with with low-level illusions like that you don't even know who you're dealing with you don't know who you're dealing with that might be true but I know that you're out of your league down here clearly so far as the leagues have gone were the best league we're the major league yeah we're the National League Pro stars we're the pro stars yeah I'm big story might be pros you are still big I think that only lasts a minute so you're I mean you guys are pros in the yeah but can you make it in the playoffs oh man we don't buckle in sir coach yes sir coach always says anymore hustle well I think we only need one of them alive yes so deceit who's it gonna be you realize there's no need to kill us you've already killed our our two friends well what good are you to us alive what do you want here yeah we just want audience with the Queen we're looking for Oscar you're you could have asked nicely instead of shooting our faces off we open the door and you shot at us I mean you're not supposed to be here if you wanted to meet with the Queen you could have joined up gone through the normal channels arranged a meeting but instead you barged in not invited well no we asked and we were told to go this way he also kind of got like partial channels through winning the fight yeah we want to fight the guy who put us in the fight said yeah just go down that so you're impatient the Queen's busy so are we yeah we have we have we have a schedule well if you've got urgent matters there's two ways you can go from here up that way you can drink to her honor and that'll lead you safely through her passages and then you can see how much further you can get from there or if you want to meet with her right now you can head down to her office have a chat with her but you won't be able to get anywhere close to her why not she's in her office but she's not there real words are confusing I say we bring him along with us yeah so that way we know he's not deceiving us with his lies I'm gonna disarm him okay I'm gonna pat him down and take away all his weapons all his stabby tools I assume it's it's comical about how many knives he has yes it's ridiculous like I just keep finding ya I'm just shaking keep that between your toes and and just throwing them in different corners of the room and down the stairs and stuff can I ask lies to remove her spell casting focus does she have one she she does she has a crystal orb you're taking it you're taking it listen they both say we might be called the Seaton lies but we're not interested in dying like those two Sora's over there seems like it was a sorrowful occasion for them I also I mean I know what I'd like to survive in the city kind of got to take your fights as you get them right so it makes sense that you don't want to die I can respect that if we leave you alive and you try to backstab us Vale will kill you it's true yeah what are we doing I also ripped an alligator and a half earlier so that's horrifying just saying okay uh we can take the battle cabinet we need we need a huddle we need a plan okay now we have to decide do we continue down this road go to her office and talk to her which I assume it was like maybe it's like an illusion or we'll get there and it's like not hurts like maybe it's like her like Harold yeah or and then we go to this other ways and we drink something which might be like poison and we have to go further I have a heavy Constitution why don't we I mean lots and drinking lots of Narconon I can hand a little bit of drink in the Queen's honor why don't we get um deceit to come with us like as our guide yeah yeah what about lies what do we do with her can we lock her downstairs yeah do we have any when was the last time we passed a prison I mean I have a bunch of rope we could just tie her up yesterday how often do people come to change places with you guys once every couple days but were the main ones we've earned our keep here because we can we can go through as we want to you won't be able to though why you have to drink in the Queen's on okay then we'll do that what does that mean no we'll show you it's just this way if you want to see it lies I'm gonna I'm gonna tie up lies and I'm just gonna leave her in the corner of this room roll over no I want her to be found I just don't want her to go running off right now so like in a few days when somebody comes to check they'll find her she'll live but that will teach you a lesson for shooting bolts I would asking questions yeah and you're spinning your hands and your eyes went all weird for a second by the way you fire bolts and don't ask questions all the time but I don't know I'm okay with it when you're doing they're not coming at us yeah as long as the bolts are coming away from us and not at us and I'm happy so the other thing I thought was we could just put a certain box in this room and just sort of leave I think we want to talk to the Queen just roll up and we just walk away and we just we just do a cool slow motion why don't we presented to the Queen as again what if she's as smart as she is she might be able to true we don't want to hand it to her ya know and we'll see if we can get to her and then we'll we'll go from there so which way do I want to go do you want to go trick drink to our owner or go visit her I will drink to our honor I'll drink to her honor let's go drink to see it lead the way they lead you through they smile they lead you through whoa whoa whoa whoa did we see the smile yeah I tied lies up though didn't I okay so you tied lies up and deceit is bringing you yeah okay and we take her orb and I go you get this back when I get back so they bring you around the corner to a smaller room that looks like a small room and around the corner there is a small bar with a statue of a bartender behind the bar and the statue is able to move very slightly like as if there's gears moving it around and in front and behind it there's several bottles of various drinks and deceit says he points down the hallway and you can see in front of you there is a archway leading down the hall and it is filled with a thick green gasps deceit says the great Queen needs all who would pass drink in her name and you can see in front of you at the bar there is a bottle of red wine a cask of yellow Mead a can of white milk and a pot of black coffee and there are several drinking cups and deceit says I can walk through that because I'm immune to the poison I built up in me and immunity over the years but you are going to need to drink the antidote if you want to find out what it is ask the barman I have a question do you know what it is I don't what's your question through that poison he's a hallway correct yep how far is the hallway till the poison stops I don't know been through it I had been through it but I was chosen to protect this place because I don't know that information q so all of us that are here to protect it the Queen the thieves picked us because we don't know the answer but when you walk down it how long are you walking for I couldn't tell you that okay but then we're just gonna murder you because you have your useless what's gonna keep you alive you got it you gotta give us like you gotta get us to talk to the bar man let's go to the barman it's a little bit of information I mean we might have stumbled upon that I walk up to the barman and I asked barman what the antidote the barman speaks wow the Great King bids all who would past see safely drink in her true name the drink is a drink more pure than water and one more deadly than poison when you finish a drink it fills your cup but you'll die if it's all you have to drink behind him the only drink they are a bottle of red wine a cask of yellow Mead a can of white milk and a pot of black coffee and there are several drinking cups and is the are they like open containers like is is is everything just like sitting out like it's been sitting inferred uh they all appear to be fresh I I turned it to seat one more time and I say is there like a concoction we need to make or is it just one of these I think it's I think you just have to you have to figure out I really don't know I've heard the the riddle a bunch of times but I couldn't tell you the answer what if we send him through the gasps he's immune and we just make him like go open the door or I don't know I just I can't have any more wine I can so can you can you read the yeah one more time what is the great Queen bids all who would pass safely drink to her true name it's a drink more pure than water and more deadly than poison when you finish a drink it fills your cup but you'll die if it's all you have to drink and behind him is a bottle of red wine a cask of yellow Mead a can of white milk and a pot of black cotton and in front of him are several drinking cups we drink the blood of the barman to see what's the Queen's name don't know my immediate thought is that his wine more pure than water we could just yeah I I like the idea of making this swamp water it just just just mix them all together that's it what's the when you finish it your cup is filled yeah what milk because it runs it cuz in the glass it like always like leaves a film we're going on milk film I'm putting my life on milk the barman repeats the great Queen bid it's all who would pass safely drink in her true name a drink more pure than water more deadly than poison when you finish your drink it fills your cup but you'll die that's all you have to drink we are all the glass is the same is this like they're all the they're all the same all the cups are empty yeah I have an idea we all drink a different one and see who makes it down the hall that's the gamble see I was I'm on board with that or if there's something else going I can't teleport I really need a long rest before we visit the Queen we could go the other way you know what Pluto what's that I believe in you I'll take the milk the bartender comes around where is the milk what's in front of you it might not be the only okay because I don't think it qualifies all of them I think it's though because if you just drank milk your whole life did you die no but that what the riddle the riddle says if it's all you have you'll die right is it wine because I think I think it's the I think it's the concoction I think it's a cocktail of everything except the milk you're going to sip the milk Oh Oh what if it's what if it's whatever you do you chug whatever it is the great Queen bits all who would pass safely drink in her true name a drink more pure than water and more deadly than poison when you finish your drink it fills your cup but you'll die that's all you have to drink what if we had two drinks you do back-to-backs i double fist home I bet there's like a hundred people right now who knows I'm dying I feel like it's not any of them I feel like it's I think it's the bartender's blood I'm gonna rip off and bartender what do people normally order from you like what's the spouse what's the house specials and points to the drinks B and he as you know he goes around and again behind him is a bottle of red wine a cask of yellow Mead a can of white milk pot of black coffee and several drinking cups you know what Oh waiter the Queen wait no Sebastian you drink the milk yes okay you are unconscious good is it me we don't know if he's just lactose intolerant like maybe he just doesn't like Sebastian he knocks it back and he just passes completely out and slumps down to the ground I take it he's alive he's not dead Sebastian what if we drank the whole cask of Mead because that's a lot and it would if it's the only thing I drank I'd probably die and deceits with us right mhm he laughs I go up to him and I shake him and I say what happened he says you're you're the first one like you're the first ones I've ever had to actually try this thing so I don't know I guess the wrong answers are poisoned in some way the the Queen has a has an incapacitating poison she's probably used it on him wrong answer I guess can we still do whatever we need to do with Sleepy Sebastian can I can if I give a walk of the of the the cup that he drank from does it smell like poison I was like milk if I take salmon and you still have a bit of milk I just rub it around does anything happen to it like muscle or anything it happens okay a one one more time mr. bartender man okay I taught atomic the great paying Queen bids all who would pass sink safely drink in her true name a drink more pure than water and more deadly than poison when you finish your drink it fills your cup but you'll die if it's all you have to drink and behind him is a bottle of red wine a cask of yellow Mead a can of white note and a pot of black coffee and several empty drinking coats I'm gonna try the coffee okay and I'm gonna take a whole thing of the coffee and I'm gonna say out loud I was giving me books over there I'm sorry jet to the Queen and I'm gonna chug the coffee there you see pollute Oh fall unconscious with a clatter on the ground yeah well I can tell you what it's not the coffee also not the milk the great Queen bids all who would pass safely drink in her true name a drink more pure than water and more deadly than poison when you finish your drink it fills your cup but you'll die if it's all you have to drink and behind him is a bottle of red wine a cask of yellow Mead a can of white milk and a pot of black coffee what is the failure cup a drink more debt more pure than water and more deadly than poison when you finish your drink it fills your cup but you'll die if it's all you have to drink I'd say just pick one all become conscious I mean I mean we can we shouldn't but we can top with us being captured by the Queen that could be fun I really should have I really should have sat down before I drank like I was so confident I just fall over I drink the wine and you fall unconscious and that is where we're gonna end for the night oh it was all of them I'm telling you it was the bartender's blood do you know what the answer is now no was it the mead well I guess we'll have to leave that as a mystery don't tell us Chad Kyle thinks he knows the answer alrighty with that we end on a cliffhanger our whole party unconscious what will happen next time in Drakon hein I don't know but it's with that guy that we almost murdered that's the end of dungeon subtraction ok well that
