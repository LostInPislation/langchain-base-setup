reaches of the ruined city of Dragon hime making their way from the northern reaches of the city and let's see that on our map in the north in North Castle region heading all the way down the the sprawl across the river and into the spokes this long journey so that they could find respite temporarily in the nearby village of ember wood the last remaining bastion of civilization for miles around as they traveled through the ruins they battled against several Knolls passing by temple gate and they crossed the dran river through with the aid of a strange undead ferryman named mr. sticks oh yeah as they made their way through the spokes of Drakon hein however they encountered a group of pilgrims following a faith known as the falling fire they were being accosted by a group of bandits known as the Queen's men and after a short tussle the group managed to fight off the the bandits although some of them managed to get away and with a strange farewell to the followers of the falling fire who made their way further into the city our group made their way for the sanctuary of amberwood village after encountering the erstwhile merchants aldor the immense the group settled down at the bark and Buzzard tavern to have some well-deserved hot meals and a few cold drinks as they sit around the table at the bark and Buzzard it's a small familial establishment Sebastian you recognize it from your childhood as being one of the few taverns in the village there were a few others growing up but this was always one of those warmer family establishments where the fathers could come in from the fields and bring their children well well they knocked back a few beers and reminisced about the good old days the bark and buzzards taproom is moderately sized there's about four or five large tables all pushed together with benches and a long bar with several taps of cider and ale a local brew that the family that runs the bark and Buzzard have been brewing for generations probably and you can still smell that beer in the air as the frothy mixture is kind of sloshed across the floor as the taps are flowing quite eagerly for what else is there to do in amberwood village on the cusp of Drakon Hinds ruins but drink yourself to unconsciousness to deal with the crushing reality of the world you live in it's healthy it is its coping um Everwood village is abuzz with many people passing through however on your way in you pass by groups of merchants and traders because trade is the lifeblood that keeps the city alive and there are more than just yourselves interested in plumbing the ruins and the Delirium whether or not some of the other people hanging around and ever ember wood village are bandits or the faithful of the following fire about to make their pilgrimage further into the city or even members of other groups is anyone's game because the village has become a bit of a no-man's land and the well you pass by what looked like maybe one or two patrolling members of the hooded lanterns it really doesn't look like there's any guard force or sort of law and order established in the city in amberwood village mind you because there's no authority that could say who to run it ostensibly the Lord may the mayor might still or the burger masters there still might be one in ember wood village but this is your first time here for for years and years and years and I don't think they are really follows local politics no no it's really not your master the burger master yes perfect delicious burger master so as you you have all taken a table together at the bark and Buzzard and the [Music] Karen osburgh the hostess a rather portly woman with a warm warm but chubby smile has already brought you your has already brought you some drinks and a little bit of bread she says don't worry those fresh due on the fire it'll be by shortly you hear my tummy grumble I'm so ready for this wasn't food earthquake come on alert dude did you say something I heard I think I hear danger I'm so ready as you all sit down and wait wait for your food what's what's the tone of the conversation I'm quiet I'm purring like a happy kitten because I am anticipating all the food and I'm in the warmth and I feel safe and I'm just happy to be here Pluto's reflecting on his almost defeat at the hands of Roche and he's starting to like he's quietly has this inner monologue of am i worthy he's had me like three times you say it's an inner monologue but I feel like you're actually just mumbling this between big things and I'm staring like off into the abyss like I'm not even so it's a very somber table right now except for her she's just like both of you like what's going on written good guys and I literally like find a bone on the floor and I tossed out Pluto and I'm like Pluto tell me about that troll you killed it hits off my helmet and lands beside me there's nothing wrong with having help we've worked together on so many jobs Pluto that's well I had help I technically it was my sword that held me what a 180 realizing that he's been in his in his own head we really got to him he's still tending to his wounds you know we did okay we survived you know this what happens any survival in the city is like a great thumbs up so you all did great cuz we're still not dead so it's perfect yes Sebastian starts like looking around the bar once again nervous about possibly recognizing somebody right he's he's not really paying attention to these two he's more like taking in the scenery because he hasn't been here in 15 years and he's surprised that like nobody's said anything to him yet but then he realizes like he was he was like 15 years old 15 years ago so yeah it may be he looks a little bit different maybe nobody's gonna recognize him as your gaze passes around the bar you see seated up at the one of the barstools is a tallish man with bright orange hair and a set of goggles on the top of his head and he as his drink as Karen Ellsberg kind of passes by him and sets a drink down in front of him he turns around to look out around the bar and his eyes catch yours and there is as he turns around you can see this was a weathered aged space the man looks like he might be in his probably about in his 50s maybe merging 60 but they're still the color in his hair and he has a very large full beard and a mustache that has been turned up in a little bit of a twirl and you can see the his face is kind of marked clearly by either Burns or embers that have burned into his skin in places and there's a very clear difference in where the goggles are normally on his face from where the rest of from the little bit of flesh that is not either protected by goggles or beard and as he as he turns around and catches regards everyone in the bar he catches eyes on you Sebastian and the you make eye contact and he kind of squints his eyes for a moment that's my dad right like obviously I am your you're certain this is your either yeah I like stand up from the table like very loudly pushing my chair back abruptly and I kind of once again start looking around awkwardly and I'm like guys I think I we need to wear what are we I work I need to go I mom and as you as you stand up the the flash of recognition appears on the man's face and he says Sebastian oh okay I'm usually much more confident than this hi mm-hmm good intro thank you I've been oh man I've been thinking about this moment for 15 years and that's the best I can do okay you got this Sebastian you got this dude oh yes I like you thanks Pluto that's guys this is it's my dad I'm back hello son I is it you really is it my eyes aren't playing a trick on me are they no I've I've come home he walks towards you comes off of the bar he looks at into into his drink takes a swig of it sets it back down the park I grabbed the drink off of my table and finish the rest of it and set it down on the table and he walks up towards you vo and Pluto the men definitely has the familiar of resemblance to Sebastien if Sebastian wasn't so much of a twig you can see the that this man Tobias Crowe has is a strong armed man that stands quite a little bit taller than Sebastian totally stan is standing up and he walks forward with that kind of well well-oiled aged right he's you can see that he's a man that's been working with his hands every single day of his life but he walks forward a little bit slowly as he as he comes up towards you and he reaches out and he puts his hands on your shoulder and says let me get a good look at you boy are you eating laughs I mean probably not to be honest we've been living off of scraps for the last while we're traveling right now you know how it is yeah he says he turns to the bar and says Karen it's on me for me and me and the boy and there is friends shall I sit please join us Sebastian introduced us to this this Hulk of a man uh this this is my father Tobias Crowe yeah he owns the blacksmith shop in town we we owned he owned a goddess it's we're still going strong don't worry boy good that's good to hear that's yeah uh I'm sorry for what oh did you just fart oh maybe but I it's it's been a while and I'm sorry it's been so long I uh I missed a few birthdays it has been but you know the after you were taking the the Eckerman x' one of their boys years and years ago the Academy came for them and they never saw that boy again either I just figured that that was what happened when they came I not met many others who [Music] the Academy came and I thought this will be good for you that you'd have an opportunity that you'd be safe that you'd be get taken care of in a way that you always were part of a world that I couldn't understand I'm a simple man and I figured that at least with the Academy wherever off you were gonna be in the world we'd be with people that would understand what was happening so you haven't heard any stories about me or anything there after I left no no no one's ever heard anything that's a little you're in here an ember would spin a strange 15 years as you can imagine but it's been good the shops been good life's been good you know war is good work for a blacksmith I bet I bet it's good work for a sorcerer too so what brought me back here I graduated from the Academy that's good that's good I'm glad to hear it and what are you here on on work then yeah some of my friends at the Academy asked me to come back here and team up with a you've never met Pluto before he's a companion of mine we've fought together several times sir where'd you get that chain mail oh this old thing covered in acid stains and birds in the morning he should come over around my shop and we can maybe negotiate a little bit for a deal he can give you the friends and family discount this is an honor to meet you sir he takes your hand and shakes it you remember I mean she was just a kitten when you last saw her but you remember they oh she was one of my friends I do you still a troublemaker papa carrot top of course I think I saw you lurking around the village once in a while over the past few years I figured you were doing okay but we haven't really spoke at all since Sebastian left no I mean I've been doing some jobs keeping my belly full you know keeping an eye out for her my dad ja you happen to see him around I know you used to know him oh the old Stuart yeah gods knows he'd be around you'd think that he would have got sighted up with one of the other noble houses seen what they could do about the war and all but I wouldn't expect anyone that would have been in any position of power dragon I'm to keep her out here all the big all the big Nobles are moving they're moving on unless they're trying to pick over the ruins my dad wouldn't have left without me so I know he's here but if you haven't heard anything then it's a crying shame I'll keep asking around but thank you for the food appreciate that very much well at least I can do where where are you staying we haven't really sorted that out yet we uh we were gonna stay here well you should come stay up at the house but no no not the old house got a new about a new home now question that's gonna it's a new life it's been a new life for me and the times he's gone and I'll admit I never thought I'd see you again I won't lie this is going better than I expected I was I was I was nervous I was nervous you know after a certain amount of time passed it's almost like it was too much time so coming back just felt strange it's strange that you're back I'll say but I hope that you got the help you need it I can I can control it now better that we can talk about it about it later I I don't want to I don't want to remember sad things there's enough of that in the world these days fair enough I'm just whispering to Pluto I'm like seein he was worried you don't why why were you avoiding this place great food shelter this is like pros all around rumor the three of you going into the end of the city then yeah we're we're doing some work around dragon hime there's a lot of a lot of jobs and a lot of jobs for specifically people of our of our skill types never like the city like it even less these days that makes sense feel you there yes sir we do want to get into the city well that's a whole other matter entirely I just sell make my wares here I'll tell you I've seen a fair amount of it come back into my hands or end up as scrap metal but a man's gotta work gotta feed belly's right yes take another awkward I kept your goggles that you gave me the oh I see that that's how I knew it was you before I left yeah but yeah you the kind of guy who looks down at his at his drink and and Ponder's over it for for a moment I um the Lots changed my boy yeah I can see that there's you know that the town seems busier than it used to I don't I don't want you to be upset by what I'm gonna have to tell you that's always a great way to start I just I never thought I'd have to say it do you want to finish the round and come around to the house yeah sure okay he turns up and and he turns around it to karen says Karen hoger Horace some of that some of that Nordic whisky will ya it's pretty strong stuff and he says shots with your dad I am you've been delving into the ruins at City around the outskirts yeah you've been ok you can say so far so good we've gotten a few scraps but like I said I'm I'm well trained now and so are my comrades here I also know the city as you know I've been living here for quite a long time so I'm I make sure he's safe and Pluto's killed a troll I kill the troll that's impressive there's it's not safe even here in the village people go missing I don't want to know that you've gone missing that you don't come back I thought I'd you were gone if you're gonna go gallivanting off into those ruins get yourself killed that's what you're here for I'm not here to get myself killed I'm here to get some answers about certain things what kind of answers you know why I was taken away yeah I figured they'd figured that they didn't really tell me much that's um that man he came I think his name was rune worden Eldrick rune worden aldrick he came and he said that they were gonna take care of you now that you were gonna be an apprentice that you were gonna grow up and the Academy and that that was all they could promise but they do their best that they take care of you that was all I knew that was all they told me I had to come back I mean I woke up I woke up screaming in the middle of the South wards of Drakon Hine after having a nightmare of a falling star and only a few days later it was hit in the exact spot that I woke up it's gotta mean something I don't know neither do I that's why I had to come back I was offered work from the Academy and work that would allow me to finally take a look at maybe maybe find some things out that I need to know you um you always had dreams you always had nightmares they always you followed you everywhere you went do you still have them from time to time there's still the Hound still have nightmares about the Hound dear friends don't No dogs house I'm kind of used to the night screaming when he was a boy I'd have to lock him down in the cellar so that he would stop screaming so I could get a good night's sleep his stories yeah they're not good no nothing nothing no there's no there's no fun childhood stories here strange that's why we we didn't stay in the old house can't you solve it no by it the shame that's your mother paid a fortune for it but we never lived there again you got a new home shall we finish up the round then yeah yeah let's do that it's so many more questions though when I arrived in this table well ask away it's been a while Vale yeah well locking in the basement for one thing that's a that's a bit harsh we did it because the first time it happened all the glass in the house broke with his screams okay well I mean I could see why he would do that yeah the basement there were there were a few incidents in my younger days it does not surprise me young incidents from young Sebastian having incidents they are they were way worse than the incidents I have now are you sure oh yes we don't talk about them right now stuff yeah why won't you go near the old house like it's a perfectly good house is it let's finish up the rounds maybe we could you know find a way to sell it help you move it I get some money back he turns he just turns to you he leaves a very close I also mean it reminded me of his mother Oh I mean she bought the house so that doesn't surprise me but doesn't mean you can't survive on the new place is on the other side of town let's go yeah we don't need to talk about this guys what's move along finish your drink Sebastian sir he knocks his drink back can I get some stew to go okay thank you and he he leads you through the little what do you think man you never told me your dad was so cool he's alright there's a lot of there's a lot of history yeah he's he's a nice guy he's a good guy publisher top has the best stories yeah I want to hear some embarrassing Sebastian stories he he laughs and says try and think of one I haven't seen him in many years but there's there's quite a few he might uh you're not gonna burn me alive well if I tell him no dad when we got caught we're putting her hand in the thing good times he started a warehouse fire in the South Ward the two you were breaking in trying to steal from the warehouses in the South Ward what were you in there after anyways some fish Thanks it was just a bit of fun dad there's it's just kid stuff he leads you up around the road past his shop the old black net it's the toosh in the chimney shop that you recognize from your youth that has the old sign Crow and Sons smithy and he leads you to the other side of ember wood village across the pond far away from the old house in fact the way that it goes around the the forests and the trees of Ember wood village it is the one spot in the village where you absolutely cannot see the high steeples of that old manor house and as you come up to the house that you remember growing up and maybe for the last five years I'll rather large addition has been built onto it and all the lights are on inside the home and as you walk up the lane way towards the house the front door bursts open and three red haired children running out Tobias you never told me you're an uncle who are who are these people they they come up and there's two a boy and two young girls the boy it's this pretty much the spitting image of their of their father they're all red haired and the boy looks like he might be about 12 years old but he's already tall and lanky and almost as tallest and get getting like a very awkwardly tall 12 year old and the girls look like they might be about six and eight and as they they they rush forward he picks up the children and he turns and says so that he says the children are already asking who father father who have you brought as a guest and he turns to them and says well this is your older brother Sebastian Sebastian I'd like you to meet Peter Emma and Sibyl pleasure to meet you Sebastian crow Hiro and as they turn a a blonde hair an older looking fair blond haired woman steps in the doorway he says this is my wife Moira oh yeah that makes sense it's it's very nice to meet you I'm Sebastian Crowe maybe you've heard of me the the the children come up and they they say dad said that you were at the academy that's right is that true yeah and one of the other the other children goes up to tavae oh and starts like saying is that a crossbow uh yeah baby carrot it's my favorite weapon and one of the the the eight-year-old goes up to Pluto and says did my dad make that sword you wish back at you and the the Tobias turns to Moira and says he kind of shrugs a little bit and says I said they could stay with us for the night at least and she says well she says you're more than welcome to stay there's not gonna be much privacy though for you the children are gonna be far too fascinated by the three of you that's all right and I put I give the little one a pity piggyback and I start walking I'm like look at they're so tiny I mean I could carry my sword he takes it out the boy Peter you can you can see he's the clear signs that he's already been working the forge like he's he sees the blade and is like yeah he says dad I think he bought to make him a new sword yeah I mean this is some fine caspian steel but I'm always looking for an upgrade Andy he brings you into the home and turn it down you can see that at one point this this house probably was just one room and but it's well-appointed the the inside it's a in the inside has been plastered and the outside has been one wet washed and the thatched roof that you remember growing up replaced by slates slate shingles the yard is all fenced in and it looks like a barn has been built built out around the side and it looks like there might be you know there's a large common room inside it's cozy well-appointed with a large hearth in the center and all their provisions in a pantry off to the side and what looks like a master bedroom for for your father and his new wife and a room for the children and as you come in boy arrow starts tidying things up around the hound and says we'll fetch out some blankets and some straw we won't have you sleep in the barn you can sleep here in the common room and hopefully the kids will let you have a good night's sleep as you as you come into the house and and all the kids are immediately all over you and said have you gone into the city they asked and the one of the girls has have you killed any monsters let me tell you the tale and they she hangs on to every word you say with rapt attention it's great to have an audience this is really cool I turned to the other two and I say do you want to play tag and I immediately I tap my shoulder I go is that for strike and I run out the door and all you hear is like and the younger one says that's no fair I could never catch cats and I stopped at the front door and I say you're right this is you know a little bit unfair I will walk slowly and even with sepra strike I'm still running around really quickly the there's there's a general air of merriment as both veo and pollute Oh play with your younger siblings who ironically seem to be more interested in the two of them than you said but but after but after a few moments here hearing the stories it seems like there's that your father is kind of occupying most of your attention as he is he says he just asks I hope everything will be fine for you to stay the the kids the kids all share your own room Sebastian so that's that's fine um I I'm I'm pretty excited that I'm not an only child I had no idea and you know I is it oh is it okay if I like visit he looks he looks and says yes you have a place here you eat I mean if you want bit more privacy I can talk to a few friends and you might be able to say in one of their houses but wherever says that's that's ridiculous this is your son and his friends they can stay with us as long as they need to thank you yeah I've been sleeping at the Ackerman mill lately they turn to each other and says that place is still standing they look a little bit horrified the the Eckerman they they moved on a long time ago for us it's you know that we're we're lucky your father says turning turning to address all of you it was very hard after you left after the meteor fell but a blacksmith makes a lot of money in war I've moved around a lot I left ember wood village for a few years and I met Moira and we started a new family I figured it had been so long since I lost her mother and that you were gone I might as well try to start over like I can't blame me for that that makes sense you're not mad no I'm not mad I just he gives you a big hug I just have a big t-shirt green cat all my face sebastian finishes hugging him and I'm not crying you're crying and I am kind of like turns his back on the situation and like quickly wipes away some tears and turns back around he's like anyway good to see you yeah yeah it's a great bit a little bit more catching catching up at one point tobias turns to tu Pluto and says that Caspian steel I'm sorry to say but it's garbage well you should be sorry to say that that's not very nice I think you should come around the shop you guys are going into the city in search of all those with them weird stones aren't you oh yeah that shinies I need to fund my new expedition and so I need some if you can assist but have you brought back any of the ayran from the meteor what that's the piece we'd left a few people yeah I literally chopped it I've been working on a few bits using the iron from it and it heats up real hot that forges harder than anything else on this planet anything else in the area that I've ever seen mmm no one knows this yet but the iron from the meteor might be just as valuable is that delirium stuff back to the rat's nest imagine all the fish yeah I'll try to ignore your slights against my peoples but you can you could make something better than this no offense but Caspian don't know hammers from their arse I mean I think about a time when I saw someone hammer their arsenal yeah they put some nice gold gold and silver filigree on their armor but take all the fancy trappings off it what do you got after that me exactly III I mean I can always go for a new sort of shell I can always be upgraded and again I'm politely absorbing your blows against my people but I can I can see that you're a big brawny man and I would love to see some of your work and I I think I can put aside my pride to delve into more luxurious and more powerful items alright so be it then as the night begins to wind down and the children are put to bed far later than they would normally be going to sleep they take a very long interest in all three of you and are eager to play tag with veo or or I asked about tales of monsters and eventually the three of them come around to you Sebastian Lee and they they say so dad said that you're a mage you want to see something cool sure I cast mage hand don't you start finding the hand around and picking up objects and moving them around the room the the makeshift hand as it begins picking things up the kids begin giggling and laughing and they pick up one of the chicken bones leftover from from supper and say can it catch yep and they throw it and you grab it with the mage hand in midair you have any more tricks I cast a minor illusion and I make a man and I make make it true I can't make a troll oh I make a bunch of like butterflies flying around the room I start to taste them yeah they giggle and laugh and chase the butterflies with veo eventually the evening calms down with a display of magic much laughter a few more drinks some food the children are asleep and Tobias and yri have to carry them into their beds and Tobias turns around says it's good to see you boy it's good to see you too your dad he says it's good to have another happy memory instead of a sad one I agree have a good night good night I really should have come back here like sooner without Sebastian at Lakehead had so much fun so much meals have been fed for you help teach me next time yeah why were you ignoring it don't worry about it I just there's there's a lot of stuff that's happened with me and my dad and I know he's a good man I just it's tough sometimes I don't know I don't know I didn't know how he would take seeing me again I didn't I didn't know I didn't know if it'd be okay I didn't know what he was expecting for me I didn't this went a lot better than I expected and now I have brothers and sisters that's crazy no it's not is he remarried and had children with her yeah I mean is that crazy okay you know parental expectations food parental expectations food I would have come back years ago no I you know you're still in the sign you know okay you know what's happened has happened I'm back now and we all got fed we have a place to stay and we've uh we have a place to sleep in Everwood Village doesn't cost us money that's true it actually gives us free food I am all for it your dad is such a nice guy as long as we don't steal anything around him then we're good right he doesn't need to know about how god I lied to him she lied is such a good-hearted man how would you do that I didn't want him to know what actually happened I told him I graduated from the Academy it's true I was wondering about that yeah and does he think you just like you just graduated like yesterday I mean maybe I kind of just left that one there and we'll I'll come back to that later he doesn't have to know yeah we'll we'll let him have a happy memory instead of oh your son got kicked out for never mind anyway cool good times I'm glad we're here we all just like laying beside each other and like the living room yeah so so the inside of the house there's there's a large hearth with a big big stone hearth and chimney that that warms the whole the whole house and they they keep the fires and the chimneys going most of the night because it heats the whole house and it's a common room with it with a table and Maire brought out a few a few blankets and a bit of straw and kind of made some makeshift bedding for you all to sleep sleep on so it's not uncomfortable but but it's not like a featherbed right and so it's about the equivalent of camping of a sleepover party I call right by the fire and I do like a belly flop right into the hay right by the fire cuz like the whole house only has four rooms there's a pantry the two bedrooms and the common room and then there's the barn so and it's definitely one of the nicer homes in amberwood village aside from some of the manor houses that are around right your dad's done OK for himself thanks thanks to both of you guys for I don't know getting me here and being with me for this I don't think I could have done this without you I've never said that out loud before thanks guys I was half asleep so what nothing Pluto don't worry about it I'm nocturnal so you know I'm you talk to me thanks for anything yeah I'm glad I'm glad I have you around yeah God to be around old friends and new family it's been an interesting a little while in Dragon hime so far mm-hmm what's uh what's our next bills it thought I never thought past eating more meals at your parents house [Laughter] I mean we're gonna be finishing up this this job with River soon and yes we have so many leads to go on we have if the who does at the Queens Queens Park there's the eldritch lilies but yeah we have some jobs for Oscar getting into the city seems problematic the haze is heavier in there well speaking of needing friends ah I got something we could do so so remember how I used to go into the city a lot yeah I actually used to have this awesome hideout that I got kicked out of you have a family too no my father's somewhere but I have a place that I could stay but does everybody have a houses in Dragon it's actually above the haze which is amazing which is why I flying counsel are you kidding oh my Davidge oh no no but you know the clock tower that you see yeah that's actually my hideout and my place but kind of got um Delbert Humphreys you mumbled that last part sorry yeah I didn't harpies harpies think I should tell my harpies the irony is not lost on me so you know if we can make it into the city you know I we can't stay in there very long but if we could hang out in my clock tower it might be a little bit easier we might be able to stay in and be there a little bit longer so it's worthwhile if you could help me get my my loft back like like a base of operations in the city yeah we could interesting interesting but in order to do that we'll have to get through one of the gates ah easy as pie we can do that no problem but if you promise to help me get my hideout back from these darn harpies then uh you know I would say we could call it a base so we have a potential base we have the elder to Louise from Queens Park we have to deal with a gay um sounds like we have lots to do on our list yeah we can do that I'll help you get your your face back because I mean hang it out in a clock timer seems pretty sweet and I mean yeah having a base of operations inside the city just means that we can you can hole up there we can prepare we can practice new spells well okay oh we're gonna hold off on that because I don't want you to burn down the clock tower yeah that's cute but we can definitely keep some stuff there for sure yeah they are if you can get me into the city I will help reclaim your lost tower what do you think I'm here for I can get you into the city hopefully I get you keep saying it's like what I'll get you in hopefully yeah what how do you plan on getting into the city I've got a couple different ways we can try you know I used to go in the sewers and that was kind of an easy way in so I mean that would be I mean it's not the easiest way but it's a way there we also do have an in with the hooded lanterns now by and I mean we did save one of them we also saved a group of the those falling fire pilgrims yeah yeah yeah when rely on those nuts too much though aren't necessarily nuts they okay well they might be but they they know a lot about the meteor we could use one of them we could use them just to get through right I want to talk to them I mean I want to know what they're up to I feel like don't believe did you take a pamphlet yeah you what have you been reading it's I just took a few just you know you've even highlighted Birds i-i'll itíd the parts that have to do with the crater I'm interested I'm an interesting party I've got one more way potentially we him the city I mean this is not the most recommended way but it is a way which is over the wall okay and I said before that we shouldn't go over the wall but we cool so the sewers the gates were over the wall honestly they how bold are you guys feeling I mean the obvious choice here would be to go the easiest way which would be probably through the gate with the hooded lanterns it would be easiest I don't know how much my pride of going to those guys would help me anybody I mean there is also the gate that's uh isn't that where the Noles are coming from there's a gate run by Knowles although that seems dangerous if you want to take a look at your map let's let's pull that up so everyone can see you'll you'll notice that the the market gate the Shepards gate is number five number one is the market gate number two is the castle gate and number four is the temple gate and those three gates are currently occupied apparently by various types of monsters but number five which is the Shepards gate is held by the hooded lanterns because that's where they keep the old city watch barracks and gate number three according to rumor is held by the followers of the falling fire as the entrance by way what by which they're using to get into the South Ward of the city so the pilgrims can then get to st. Selena's Abbey which they're using as their sanctuary Dewey is Vale relaying this information or do we actually own a map of dragon hood you did recover a map of dragon hime earlier and I think it's fair to say that all of you have a sense of the city with with the knowledge that things might not be quite as you remember I given it's been it's open a long time and there's certainly ruins and collapsed buildings on the inside well your clock tower number twelve by the looks of it the easiest way we're down champions way right now if we had yeah through champions gate which is run by the the falling fire guys then we can just go through the South Ward will go right near the great Cait crater which seems maybe a little problematic but then we can just cut across the bridge up to the clock tower let's see the Hayes would be pretty strong there will be fast it's the fastest way will be fast you know yeah up for a jog through some waves I'm just I'm worried that you're gonna fall to these this cults like I feel like you're you're joking no don't I'm into it I'm interested in the crater and so are they we have a common interest that's all it is it's just like this is exactly how they recruit people like this is I know I start shaving my head you're gonna shave your head you're gonna get these weird tattoos if I start down that path you have permission to punch me in the face full strength full strength you know how much I like my face would you be the lanterns out again there at the Shepherd's gate which is marked by five on your map that's a long track I we could make it there in just a like a short time if we just but that is both are equal distance especially if we go through the market that ways definitely the safer way to stay away from a veil you do know that the South Ward and the crater is by far net next to the area around the castle are the most dangerous areas of the city yeah we definitely want to avoid that great career until we figure out what's the what the haze is all about it's turning people like they're they're willing to follow like these bald people into death like that there's no way that's okay well since fails telling me that it's the most dangerous part of the city I didn't know that I just thought it was a cool crater that we could go look at you wanted to go and join them not join them okay um let's let's take the long way I mean does need temptation I don't want to give you I mean time is on our side it's not like we have to worry too much about Oh Heather Josh the river with Styx again this might be my biggest regret but what are the sewers like dirty we've been in there that's where we lost rat food they're dirty I'm not not untrackable is it safer than the champions way um you're in your professional what the champions way would be one of the most dangerous not just because but how close we get to the crater so I would avoid that way if possible do the sewers cross the river or would we have to still deal with the river the sewers don't go under the river at least if they did that would be completely shocking well the sewers generally empty in the river yeah so the the only aside from access points that would be inside the city there the you passed by an entrance to the sewer when you passed by near Styx's Ferry you remember seeing a few entrances there that were kind of exit points for the sewer because remember the river flows to the south so the area around where Styx has this ferry is where a lot of the sewers drain out I did when we were crossing the river I saw a group of very large turtles go into the sewer right near where Styx was meaning that there's there's got to be a way in right around there that's true yeah we can hope that the turtles are friendly I mean I doubt it but I mean I feel like together we could really take on anything we're pretty strong group together yeah we haven't almost died several times several times so I think what I'm hearing is that the sewers sound like an interesting possibility as a way of getting inside the city definitely as opposed to negotiating with anybody to get through the gates I would say if the sewers don't work out we can always try the the lanterns they would become my number one yeah the sewers seem to be our our best like free option yeah whereas I you know these are the ones we might have to make cut deals but that being said Pluto's a little hesitant back especially if I'm gonna work on getting new armor and then gonna get dirty you're gonna get dirty regardless durian drunk I don't think I'm a prince any morons you're a pretty oh yeah I forget that I thought you were a monster hunter which is it mutually I have to be both I could be royalty and kill things yeah I'm messing with you mmm-hmm there's little royalty acknowledged in dragon high many ways so yeah not much usually looking like a princess [ __ ] or puts you on a target for especially the thieves around here I wouldn't worry about looking to princely uh where are we supposed to meet River she said that she would contact you okay we could also talk to Al door and see if he has any right ideas on sure if he's if he's got like maybe like a you know he's heard of a way in that maybe we could leverage maybe on his the last group he sent to their demise hmm which I'm not afraid of we could ask him but I don't know how he's gonna know anything other than what we've talked about but he may know something that I don't I think our best options is look at the sewers and if that doesn't work we go with the hooded lanterns and I mean honestly keep your eyes and ears open for other suggestions we're in amberwood villa there's a lot the village there's a lot of people around here if you hear any whispers or anything of people knowing a good way into the city uh I guess we'll be open you guys just get some rope and pull me over oh but the higher you go up the harpy's yeah we're trying to avoid getting into scuffles with them until we get to the tower okay then you pull out the big guns I'm the big gun you are yeah an impressive show of muscle with that you continue to talk into the wee hours of the night before setting down to rest yeah okay rest in in the morning [Music] you uh you wake to the smell of Moira cooking what smells like probably bacon and some bread and lookin bread yeah making bread baking bread are you sure we don't want to stay here for a long time and you take breakfast with your family it's it's a nice wholesome complete breakfast with a smiling nuclear family and there's strange guests that's probably like the happiest breakfast I think Sebastian's ever had because he's never he's never had a breakfast with his dad that wasn't kind of sad because there was an empty seat at the table every single time that they would have breakfast there was always a third chair and there was never anything set up and it was always uncomfortable yeah now it is a full table with with to the the children actually have to share stools and one and the six year old the the youngest Sybil has to sit on your father's lap for breakfast go they don't have enough chairs for everyone to sit around and eat but you'll take a simple breakfast with bread and butter and some bacon and Tobias says says Peter we're gonna have another busy day at the shop let's head in do you want to come down with us and you can see some some of the things all right all right I'm so excited to I'm like you can I have a little hop in my stuff cool hey run after Peter he leaves you down to the blacksmith shop and the rest of you follow yeah bye little carrots goodbye and they're like bring it bring us some treasure next time and you head down to you touch this the two crow and son and you do realize the one thing that kind of gets you Sebastian is that you know Peter goes like is a complete natural in the shop as the shop opens up Peter's already like firing up the forge getting everything going you can see you can see I've always he's lanky he's getting some good muscle on himself he's already developing the skills of a Smith that's at 12 and as as your father shows starts talking to pollute about some of the wares that he has you kind of quietly see like Peters already showing things around the Eternity asks did dad ever show you around the shop uh I'm actually imagining this awkward moment where out of habit when we first walk up I reach for the hammer and he grabs it first yeah yeah I'm just like oh right I don't I don't do this anymore yeah and yeah I'm like yeah back in the day he tried to tried to make me into a Smith but I was good at starting fires not really controlling them or using them to accomplish anything Peter Peter turns Jan says you're lucky I guess you might get to you've already got to see the world a little bit of it not not very many great places mostly the dark and scary places of the world that sounds a lot more exciting than here it's a lot more dangerous and you're gonna have a lot of great memories that I think you should hold on to while you're here in this town he he nods and kind of continues on the on with the work and he asks you a few questions as he sets things up and kind of asking what you remember of the the shop where have you what have you been doing what kind of you know the standard awkward like really awkward brothers meeting for the first time conversation meanwhile Tobias says you know those go he he brings you up and any kind of rolls up in it over to one of his is armorstands where you can see he's got a few suits of scale mail armor he says all right don't even bother putting on that chain mail this morning let's get you fitted out put something much better Oh III can't it's so hard to admit that it's so much better than my arm says now you're my lads friend but I still have to make an ends meet can we say can you make 150 sir I'd be honored to wear this luxurious and it's like well done right it's really well made yeah yeah I'm like drooling so well made I feel like I'm getting like the employee discount scale now and friends and family it's it's not shiny by any any means it's kind of like this dull gray metal and he says I make practical armor it won't look bad when it gets dirty challenge accepted but because I made it I know how to repair it so if it does take any damage or any hits I'll give you the warranty your accident ensured we'll fix it up and you're just throwing that in it's the friends and family discount one second to go I I bow bow to the scree man just I'm trying to be as regal as as I can because I know good armor yeah and I can I can tell I'm gonna really enjoy putting the putting the miles on this this bad boy already I'm just like mental picture of this moment to remember when you bowed to someone cemented I see you looking at you to bow to me for months yeah but you are like your cool dad you're just you well just to make sure he ends up as your servant at one point again in in a situation oh yeah next time that you play my servant I'm making me doubt I got one more thing before we go and I walk outside and I kind of hop up and grab the sign and I carved using one of my scimitars an S at the end of Sun be like there it's updated I want to change some branding everywhere else to reflect the amount of Suns that you have you just damage thank you it's a nice touch but it's like I'm wicked like badass you probably could have done it much nicer than me if I just told them but it's in there now I like as you like hop back down I'm like do you have any idea how much those songs cause nope as you as you climb out you can see it looks like there's quite a big commotion back at the square oh and you can see what looks like a troop maybe about 30 soldiers complete with banners mustering up in the center of town dad I'm gonna go check something out and bayo she's like we could have avoided all right let's go no we're just gonna go look I want to see what's happening over here I want to stay close to the back against the walls to be like go ahead go ahead what are you coming with me or I'm admiring my new armor is it is it super special it's really comfy it but it is regular scale now effectively yeah it's very comfortable and pollute Oh as you uh as you all walk up to to see you can see this large assembly of several soldiers they have blue and white banners colors that you haven't seen in this area before and Ludo you're you're looking admiring all your armor so you don't quite see like pay attention but you as soon as you see these colors you recognize that these are Caspian banners there are these dumb banners these hold your tongue I can't why and you can see it see that there's about the whole group group of them are all assembly in town so several more on horseback they've got about a dozen horses with them and it looks like a troop of about two dozen men at arms equipped in mostly chainmail armor with weapons and shields all with this Caspian livery emblazoned on them and several and then there's a small contingent of what looked like a few porters and other other laborers and up around the head of the the troop started looking like they're addressing or inspecting the group is a very large half-orc clad in full plate armor and a very very short gnome that is wearing very frilled puffy blue he's kind of got those big puffy pants the big puffy arm arms on his jerkin and you got the big thrilled it around him and he's carrying a lute as well as a flute and lute some flutes you have no lute and a flute and at the center of them is clad in what looks like glittering mithril armor chainmail is a familiar face are all the visors down or visors or dancing and as you come into the guys these are reinforcements they're probably gonna be here - yeah yeah they're probably man in the glittering chainmail pulls off his helmet and you can see his square jaw and finally coiffed features and hair this jet black hair that kind of isn't a little bit of a curl and he's perfectly almost like painted on eyebrows and completely well shaven and you can smell the perfume on him and he said and as you come into the square he immediately catches sight of you Pluto and he he lets out a very loud laugh I just have to check my notes is he is he taller and bigger than Pluto no he's not he is taller than Pluto but where pollute o is like hard muscle this guy is life's in you right and you can see that there's that he is definitely looks quite a bit more charming than Pluto does mm-hmm but as he comes up he says as I live and breathe the mighty pollute Oh Jackson here in this seedy little fly spit town what are you doing here Prince Jackson Lord Jones who's this you're hanging out with a mangy cat and an orange haired girl that's gonna say meow but then he opened his mouth my name is Sebastian Crowe I don't have anything else to say that what do you want Jones

lives and so you mean to tell me that you've been poking around the bones on the outskirts of the city and haven't even delved deeper into where the real prizes we've thought we've done lots we actually worried we were just in the heart of the city and we thought we fought a a we I mean there was dragon dogs we killed dogs oh say no boy I went way overboard a dragon a young dragon it was a dragon of deception thirteen what color was the dragon red obviously and where's all its treasure it was outside of its lair we're still I mean we know where its treasure is we're on our way there we just came back here for some soup you hear that men there's a dead dragon in the ruins of dragon hime and it's treasure hoard has been completely unclaimed it's actually right next to the crater yeah been to the crater have you nearby and we'll heard of this yeah that's where the treasures hoard or the dragon's hoard he turns to the rest of his men men we shall ride into the ruins and we shall claim this dragon's hoard in the name of caspia is this a bad thing am i doing a bad thing we shall ride swiftly fight strongly question how are you planning on getting into the city I have 30 men

one and you know what Lord Jupiter Jones I think that I'm not super impressed with you you're what's going on in this right now really how are you not impressed with my fantastic Harold my chivalrous bodyguard this manly physique you know what that guy over there looks scared you uh you haven't been properly introduced to the customs of dragon hime you know you you're all way too clean looking to be here so I go is the ground wet because raining I pick up some mud and I throw it at the dwarf I say welcome to dragon hime but no or the dwarf sir roar no no no no yes sir it lands squarely in his face and he shrieked as this whole place certainly was that's a common place for the horses to go probably my own - and he starts like crying salted me and threw mud in my face those are my customs man and the Jupiter turns and says well your customs madam are barbaric and uncouth does not approve thank you that's not your barbaric uncouth I try to snipe on my lap as I like find this middle ground yeah yeah it's kind of sir Berek and goof super I thought costumes were supposed to be much more handsome and civilized but you're quite pathetic to look upon you I mean of how dare you sir how dare you even question my appearance I'm the height of fashion in caspia oh so it's all of caspia that's just ridiculous except for Pluto well I thought pollute Oh had left caspia was one of the finest suits a full plate armor that we had in Caspian I see that you've decided to dress yourself in the local style disgusting I'll bet it couldn't even stop a good blade you know what's great about the armor that we make here is that unlike Caspian armor it actually can take a few blows without breaking your armor looks great but poke it with a dagger and it falls apart in caspia we say there's only one kind of blow the people of Dragon time are good at taking oh I am slide with him I'm gonna I'm gonna put my hand on Sebastian's shoulder and I kind of ease him back because I can see he's getting he's getting into his new peril the position and and I say Jackson move on move on out we I got nothing else to say to you Lord Jackson aye aye Lord Jones I'm Jackson I'm little Jackson my name is Bluto Jackson and your name is Lord and we got nothing to say to you we were we're on a we're on a mission I think that you're the one that should step off we're using this square as a mustering zone and we need all the resources of this village to fuel our exponents expedition whoa whoa this is this is neutral ground obviously you don't know enough about dragon time to know that nobody takes up ground in this part of the city nobody yes and you might need to learn the value of a gold coin or to miss things about gold one where are we gonna get paid sir shut up you'll get paid when we come back with gold so wait we want you to leave you want us to leave look you know what you know friends we we don't have to waste our time with this oh come on gang yeah where we got places to go you can you can have the the courtyard we've got more important business to take care of yeah we don't get drawing fish about what you're doing in this village we have things to do let's be off guys I start walking away as I turned to walk away I turn back around and I'm like also you might want to check your shoulder there it looks like you have a friend and I cast minor illusion to have a tarantula crawling crawling on his armor on to Jupiter yeah he he he brushes it away with and his hand moves through it he sees black magic trying to scare me but it looks like most of his men already saw the horrified expression that he had for a split second before he realized it was an illusion I wink and then I walk away with these guys thanks gang named after a real planet guys I hate that I hate that Lord Jupiter Jones it's always one-upping me and him well I would have but I I'm gonna I'm gonna be frank with you everybody's dead yeah we know you definitely knew that okay that's why I joined you yeah he's just he gets on my nerves and I wonder why and I mean I I've we've he always gets the he always just knows how to get under my skin and and if you think I'm a pompous buffoon he's I do he's ten times worse than I am I've noticed so I mean if anything you know comparatively I'm actually pretty good surprisingly Pluto don't worry I mean you're like the cream of the crop and he's just you know sour milk so thanks don't worry about it you know you just gotta nasty personality so your personality is like the best that Caspian yeah I'm probably were you like picked on for being the nicest guy yeah I probably had like this no you know maybe look I just gotta kill something to keep my get my mind off it and I just start I I do like the kid walk where I'm kicking dirt and I'm swinging my sword at the ground I just won't kill someone murder will find a monster for you to kill don't worry there's plenty coming up what a killing now save it for the harpies save it for the harpies I want to say a big thank you to accent shield for providing us with the awesome gaming accessories we use and a tabletop audio for the great ambient music you're hearing and finally a hundred

better each week and but we hope that you still are able to enjoy our lovely voices thank you very much for bearing with us again so before we went on the break you had just had an encounter with another Caspian Adventure the Lord Jupiter Jones having stepped away from that interaction you know decided to do what I think um I mean it's already getting a little later in the day I say that we spend one more night in Everwood Village and first thing in the morning we set out for Drakon Haim by whatever path seems best whether that's the sewers or through the the gate oh yeah if you want to spend the rest of the day kind of hitting up the purpose earners checking in with your father at the blacksmith and getting any other supplies that we can kind of hand-wave most of that and figure out what supplies you need before you set out again is there anything in particular that you want to make sure that you do before with this time before you set back out into the ruins as particularly regarding supplies and stuff like that because now is the time to make sure that you've got them I think with me uh with veo she's definitely looking to get as much rations as she can carry because she's got a little bit gold in their pocket now and she wants to make sure that if we're gonna be traveling across the city and potentially not making it back here right away that we have some food okay do you all want to stock up with rations and if so for how long maybe you'd like a solid two weeks it's too much crazy it's it's a lot of stuff to carry but not I'll do I can do some of that okay I never remember back I mean we need enough rations to get us to to the Clocktower and then I guess you want to like stockpile some to avoid having to find because if if I'm not mistaken everywhere villages like them that's that's our trading it seemed it seemed pretty scarce on our way down yeah if if you if your plan is to make a base of operations out of the clock tower it's almost in the center of the ruins which means that if you need to come out and resupply you'll have to go through the city again yeah to get back out maybe we should bring some extras just in case so even if we take a little bit more than what we need as long as it's rations that will last so we're like salted meats and so like that how based on what we know about bears appetite how much can we expected to bring for like a redoubling what are we looking at three weeks one two three weeks if we can carry I mean two weeks would be three weeks [ __ ] you mr. Carey yeah two weeks I say two weeks and no I I can have some self-control if I know it needs to last some a lot Oh I'll carry some of the heavier meteor stuff okay and so you you head back up to towards the the small lake by amberwood village where I'll Dora the immense in his Caravan are camped and he greets you once again welcome back are you buying today yeah I'd like to see your wares fantastic so I provided you out with a list of all the exotic equipment that you can purchase from him but pretty much anything in the players handbook is available if you if you want to purchase it in addition I do have some very fine and exclusive wares if you might be interested in the excuse what's today's special well I do have a selection of arcane potions and Scrolls in my inventory but in addition a few artifacts have passed into my hands that I would be willing to part with for the right price tell me more yes indeed he pulls out his ledger and through the books and he says I have shield it was owned once by a paladin Sentinel who fell in battle it's gone through many owners and it's magical in nature next the amethyst Academy once in a while is able to furnish me with several of their wands I have a wand imbued with magical missiles which the amethyst Academy has crafted so you know it's high quality finally one of the hooded lanterns owed me quite a debt and sold off his old magical bracers it looks like they might be a of elven make and enhance the archers I magically those those how much are those we say it like a hundred gold for each for the braces I couldn't part with them for less than 800 gold pieces well I mean I don't have 800 I have 400 darling that's insulting its friends and family discount aren't we friends and family maybe fam friends I only give a friends and family discount they look at him with these [ __ ] I'm giving you the same price I would charge my own mother God's rest her very good soul in the depths of hell but it's the same price for my mother my father anyone I think I'll look elsewhere if that's the person gettin not anything cheaper we're poor well actually we're quite rich but apparently not nope we're poor your individual persons might be a little bit light but combined if you were to and you're asking me for friends and family discount and you won't even have how to friend didn't need companions you just drop your armor you did I'm happy with my new armor I could interest you in the potion for say fifty gold pieces maybe a hundred what kind of person healing mostly it's all that cells round here that's fair hmm give any rations plenty you can speak to my man in the back if you need some food and provisions for the in the city he'll take your order and we can agree on a fair price how much for two weeks worth that we could furnish you for only fifty gold pieces for the lot of you mmm you only find it cut a deal with me pussycat but I've been around the block a little bit longer than you might have my prices are fair and reasonable thirty thirty I know how much food is worth in the city do you I do I do plenty of jobs to earn it make your persuasion jack 21 40 37 39 salt a deal you know I know I

before sunrise can we get one more night of drinking in let's go can we go back to the one more just one more like I mean we're not gonna be back here for a while turn so this is kind of like this is like the nicest thing that we a little hotel I would not say no to some taverns do again all right you can convince me let's hit up the tavern again what's it called the market Buzzard the Barkin Buzzard we have with the sign mm-hmm yes so the Barkin Buzzard which sign of it has a vulture eating the entrails of a dog but both of them are smiling and laughing in the sign like it's the most delightful thing that's ever happened I laugh every time I see it too because it's a dog beaten by a buzzard can you not laugh at that as you head into the headed into the Barkin Buzzard tonight and it looks pretty lively as you as you head up in the later of the part of the evening as you walk in you can see a wide variety of folk have assembled in it it's packed compared to the way that it was yesterday and as you sit down and take your seats a rather skinny looking woman comes up and serves you and brings you some drinks you can't you don't see Karen or Holger all's bird in the bar excuse me staff change where's the the owners of the place the the woman uh turns around to you and says they've got the night off have they ever had the night off it I mean I guess I haven't been here in a while maybe they maybe they're doing well maybe they hired more staff what's your name Cora Cora do they often take nights off they're getting older well let's get around one round of drinks Cora coming right up I don't like your attitude by the way they'll you spy in the corner of the bar seated at a table are four familiar looking people hmm one of them there are two halflings a man and a woman a dwarf and a human man and they are all wearing the bandanas of the queen of Thieves oh yes 10 o'clock in the corner I told you we should kill them we tried a the ones that the ones that got away I threw my accent one they don't hold that against me have have they spotted us do you you caught them in a glance do you look look to see yeah I there like behind me and I'm gonna like glance over my shoulder at them who will make a deception Jack 22 you carefully turn around and they're watching you like hawks is there anybody that looks familiar from the day before in you look around scanning the bar make a perception check 13 scan around you don't recognize any of these people and all of them are armed and you think you can see the insignia of the Queen's men on another one of them it looks like they've taken a quick effort to try and conceal it under their cloak hmm it looks like there must be about a dozen people in the bar how close are we to the door you have to move past a few tables to get to the dough to the door this this is it right yes yeah do you want to let's let's play some fingers on the board let's see the setup okay okay we at the or at the bar what what table did we take the one by the stairs so there's the group of four at the far table downstairs yeah that's that's nice because you you turn your back to look at the bar yeah and I made eye contact once it saw them yeah and I'm the one who turn to look at them so that make sense where's their drinks Cora the woman in the red dress there is Cora this is and then if you want to put the others just some of the other tables anywhere you like so many yeah that looks good nobody's sitting at the pond so I've looked around yeah I'm starting to see that this this place looks a little bit crowded with the wrong type of folk yep this is supposed to be a family institution and is that a door that's directly behind Vale yes I ants at the back door and that you guys we can we do about 20 seconds of shifting eyes I'm just like looking back towards the door pork chops and any other really do I got a signal here okay I stand from the table and loudly say I have to take a leak okay you get up from your chair and as you do so the man the larger there's a large man at the base of this sitting at the table at the base of the stairs right there yep and he he turns to you he's wearing leather armor and you can see that he has his hand on the short sword that he's wearing in his side and he says the outhouse is occupied you'll have to wait a moment just sit down I mean I can go pee in the bush it is not a big deal I can just pop out the back door here I mean it's I don't need you it's fine so he says this to Sebastian yep DISA Bastian a little aggressive some pretty pretty aggressive thoughts on your BioBricks yeah just know just in case you didn't go at the other end you you don't tell my my Harold where to pee and then fine fine I'm going to grab the table men slip it Adam so I'm just gonna pick up the table and just throw it at this okay so you knocked the team I stand allowed crash spent spilling spilling the empty mugs that were left on it all all over the floor and the room suddenly goes silent there's a pin drop as everyone else in the bar gets to their feet I still have I still had a few gulps of beer in there you compete you know what so I'm standing up I'm also holding my the the end of my sword and I'm scanning the room as you do you see Cora she kind of pulls her hair back she straightened her dress a little bit and she's got the drinks in her in her hands and she says now now there's no need to get aggressive again you just want to have a little bit of a conversation with you a lot I mean talking talking is good talk would she talk with them what do you want first right that table Pluto where civilize have a scene here yeah and III motioned to the leather man gonna call him leather man okay and I and I and I and I I don't take my hand off with sword I just stare at him I don't pluto flips tables but you don't pick him up he says do it yourself ker sebastian's sighs and starts picking the table up it's very heavy but you manage Thank You Harold I came as a she as you flipped the table back over she puts three mugs of ale down in front of you and she says have a seat take a drink and then she comes around the other side and sits down as well and I'm just sitting in my chair and you can see my tail just swishing behind me I'm just like really civil constantly hi do I have the feeling that she's that she poisoned it I don't know do you I didn't know you what you feel like you're in control I do I do I I don't touch the dry I pick the drink up and I say suddenly I'm not thirsty and I pour it onto the floor why are we all being so rude she she frowns she says not many people around here would turn down free booze but fine I take mine and I'm like free booze jpgs okay lyndie drink yeah okay um and she says she gestures over to the four sitting over in the side my friends there say that you all had a bit of a disagreement with them in town yesterday uh yeah they were gonna kill some children it's our turf then we're gonna kill anybody that's not what they said they're just collecting the Queen's tax they said they were gonna gut them like pigs literally that's what they said is that true guys and they're drugged regardless you stepped on our business you interfered and now you've shown up here in town i interfere when children and elderly are being threatened yes that is that surprising to you come on come on did those guys give you any of their lecture about how crazy they are they're perfect marks don't interfere on our business this is your only warning this is my town not yours now you're on my terms and you're causing problems listen the Queen is powerful she's a merciful queen she likes people who are useful cooperative she knows that there's too many corpses in Drakon hein when people are busy robbing instead of murdering she says turning over their the city where it runs well it starts to feel a little bit like home again things go well a bunch of mercs like yourselves come into town start butting their nose in in business they have no business in then we run into some problems the Queen has a lot of work she has a lot of use you've already killed six of her voice that's a problem but maybe we can come to an agreement what do you think what sort of agreement careful I don't trust this I don't trust them either but I mean we're either fight to the death or we hear them out and then still potentially fight to the death I'd rather hear them out just in case there's something good here what do you got Queens interested in making some big scores we've been listening in as you've been asking around town we heard that little kerfuffle that you had this morning with Lord Jackson Jones well Lord Jones it's confusing to me James a lot of change this way in caspia the Queen's looking for some interested in powerful business partners the Jones are interesting and powerful maybe we make a deal with them maybe we make a deal with you a good Caspian would never find themselves with scum like you bunch of thieves and thugs and my tail starts swishing faster I said it before this is our turf now I suggest that you leave with your men before things get ugly and I'm gonna cast suggestion savings for DC 15 she succeeds damn she she reacts and the other one of us a boy he just tried to bewitch kora with his magic I heard him I heard him speaking them words I was mumbling eye bubbles sometimes it's pretty unmistakable she she says she stands back and say I guess we're gonna do this the fun way roll for initiative I know I feel like we've made this China deal I don't deal with with thugs sticking our buns in their business I need to get one of my dry erase markers so we're still around this nice little table here that's been corrected I got to try my new spell out I took suggestion when I leveled up for anybody who's interested it hasn't worked well so far over 104 one but that's okay you only have room for improvement I could only go up from here or at least stay level yeah I'll either stay the same or do better okay so going down the order what do we got there ten ten seventeen seventeen twenty and pressed myself I roll I rolled terrible that's okay did you were the best initiative out of Angela yeah sure what yet against question 17 so the group of thugs that you faced last time are going last yes they're scared they oh then the other bandits Bastion and Cora and what I'll do is since you were talking with Cora she's gonna I'm gonna move her right up over I know she's the woman in the red dress oh oh that's the omen of grim things to come beer everywhere those smashes up the bar without even trying yeah this is my special oh oh she's right next to me yeah golly okay so as the as this all goes down Cora very quickly reaches into her blouse and produces a long stiletto dagger and seeing and seeing you readying the next spell on your lips Sebastian she lunges forward into you Oh getting a 18 to hit you have had hits that hurts sorry caddie of her it's gonna be seven points of piercing damage Oh and as she lifts the blade out of your shoulder she pulls another one from seemingly in her garter and stabs you in the side getting a 19-2 hit no that's worse Oh for another seven points of damage oh geez and then she'll spend her cunning action to disengage and leap back behind the bar so she kind of like stabs you in the side pushes the daggers into you twists them briefly pushes back and leaps back over the bar and says get them Oh Ludo you're up here we go ninja woman and I the tables back up again right yes it is I throw it at the man in the leather and I say go out the back door okay I'm gonna have you make a rise attack with the table against the man what do I get to add your strength I got an 18 so you pick the table up with with two hands hurl it directly Adam and it smashes a cross in Rolla give me to d8 four damage plus your strength modifier about eight damage eight damage the table the side of the table like tilts forward and hits him in the side of the head send him crashing into the wall and you hear this snap and he just collapses on the ground dead and then I'm going to is this am i engaged with red leather vest there you are engaged with the red leather vest lady okay I'm gonna bonus action shove her with my shield okay with the new the shield I'm the master of the she oh you so finding your footing after hurling the table with so much force you're you're not able to she's able to basically just roll right out of the way okay and and again I give another yell out out now okay Sebastian okay let me just see something I can hit all three of them cinge those eyebrows alrighty so I up and I expel fire from my hands and all over that group sitting at that table as they're standing up okay they all make dexterity saving throws the woman that rolled out of the way of Pluto shield rules directly into the line of the fire and is completely engulfed by it but the other two died behind the table and make their saving throws but roll the damage regardless eight the woman uh the the woman in the red vest lands as a burned mass on the ground but the other two are simply lightly singed and they're both bloody Oh at this point I turn and I'm like I was really hoping I wouldn't set this place on fire again that that table is definitely a flame now and I head towards the back door okay as you push up against it you hear a thud no it seems like something's got the door stuck no guys the door is not open well and that's my turn okay the thugs or nose the other bandits okay I got a lot of them this is great so there's eight of them oh yeah another seven of them actually because we we have Korra so there's the two of them at the bar the man with the pumpkins and the man with the two swords over his head they pull out their crossbows and they both take potshots at pollute oh hi but the highest one is a 16 solid so I my field just takes them both the other the other three of them the the the the dwarf and the other man with the two swords the ones closer to you no no not that guy no the ones yep those two over there they rush at you pollute oh and the the man kind of lunges over the table with it with a sword and it lands on the ground with a thud and as you step back the the dwarf woman swings a short sword at you and she scores a critical hit no and it hits you right in the stomach for eight points of damage the two underneath the table that dodged out of the way of life your fire they come back around and they throw their daggers at you Sebastian the highest is an eleven whoo so the two dagger so you're you're going pulling at the door and basically these two days ooh whoosh whoosh uh exactly and I'm like oh god I want to for the one that threw that stabbed at the ground mm-hmm I want to bring my sword I want to repost okay and bring my sword on so she looks up up at you with her knife in your gut basically and you bring your sword down on her make the attack roll 18 you the sword pummel lands on her head just imagine all the fun bar fight music happening 413 damage so you cave in her skull and she collapses to the ground and the the end of the blade pulls out of your ears stomp your side would like this like squawk noise I like to think that that is what gives the other one the opening for the crit like I cave her head in and then I just get ya stabbed and the last one the woman with the serving tray she rushes forward and yes just ya know she's another event another one of the Queen's men she rushes forward towards veo with the serving tray and basically winds up with this metal serving phrase this is smash male in the face of this [Music] and she only gets a 8 all I says well I didn't order that so no thank you send it back to the kitchen this chickens cold this lady's cold vo to turn so as she's swinging at me I touched my shoulder and I cast a separate strike is my bonus action because I'm getting the heck out of there and I know the door is locked behind me so I go for the closest open window and I also have my feline agility which allows me to get about 90 feet so I'm gonna scramble over to the window and because I have zephyr strike no opportunity that window is closed so the one beside it yeah yeah so I jump through the window okay and as I jumped through mm-hmm I turn around and I take my longbow and I aim it at what's her name - Cora Cora yeah okay eyes my first attack no air jumping yeah like as you're leaping out the window it'll spin cool cool spin move and cuz my Zephyr strike I get advantage [Music] i-16 to hit tit the arrow lands solidly and strikes her roll the damn it who are you sharp shooting I am NOT okay just a cool jumping through window sure they're cool jumping through window shots I'm taking [Music] fifteen them so the the the arrow hits her solidly in the chest and she screams out in pain she's bloodied nice and I'm going to run to the second open window mm-hmm and take another shot at her okay also knowledge I won't take sharpshooter on this money with my long row and that's a twenty seven two heads yep that hits oh seven damage now extremely wounded but she is still alive and I continue just passed okay as you walk past the the doors you can see a heavy wooden bar has been pushed through the entranceway through the the door handles the bar it from the outside okay smart that's what I would as as as you you run out you can hear her screaming to the to the others don't let her get away don't let her get away go after her and the few of them they they get up the two halflings leap out the window [Music] no you're enough and the two of them see you that's the two halflings leap out the window with with their daggers land on the ground and they say see you there and you're like now we're gonna be chasing you pussycat and they come at you with their daggers to attack getting a 16 and a 17 to hit both hit poor a total of 10 damage as the two of them basically leap out the window and they kind of like bunnyhop like they land on the ground and then jump again right at you kind of like with a bonsai scream and land on the other side and they rake their daggers down your back the dwarf the the door he rushes for the door and it looks like he forgot that the door has been jarred and he like pulls at it and Cora screams at him you idiot and the the other man goes out the front window as well and rushes towards the door and you can hear Cora yelling don't open the door just go after yep and we go to the top of the round with Cora who she dives behind the bar and and you see the doors to the kitchen fly open as she runs back inside there yep into the kitchen running away eh we keep letting the pollute oh you're up I'm gonna bring my sword down on on captain crit over here twenty-two hit twenty that hits it for ten damage what happens so I scream out as he hits me and I just I just straight up and pale him with the sword I just stab it into him and I get this is actually not the guy to create you this is the guy landed on the ground you you killed that work that they're already dead okay I just stabbed through his foot and then I kind of like uppercut him as I pull myself he is extremely dead and then I rush after I go to slam the barmaid into the wall run at her and I get a bonus action shove her directly into the wall yes getting a 14 yeah you send her slamming what you want a knocker Prohm or push her okay so yeah she you slam her back into the wall and knock her prone nice yeah and I scream out you get out of here you thieves cool man I should have came home I go dinner is served afterwards it was an awkward pause it's a big long pause and you can see me stumbling Sebastian you're out basically and why not Sebastian jumps up on the table and says lights out and then uses to sorcery points to cast darkness on himself okay well we'll just remember if we need to refer to the template we'll pull it out again okay yeah so a shadow of Darkness appears around me I said 'we'll shadow he goes and I think that's that's all I can do if I use sorcery points that's my action anything yeah yeah so okay that's it does that darkness envelop Pluto okay it does not okay [Music] the bandits with no recourse but to go seeing that seeing all this magical darkness all the bandits in the bar level all their crossbows yeah exactly what I was going for so the one woman tried yes like five more than that there's seven of them no no yeah there's seven them um two three four five there's one behind that sing yeah no there's and then there's the barmaid so she's gonna try to stab Pluto but she's prone so she's got disadvantage so she only gets him seven the others all try to shoot you they basically all level their crossbows and you hear this I'm not doing so hot five and a ten a 817 and a crit the credit their aim is true tonight another crit in the nighttime what and a natural one so basically this two visits definitely there's two crits and two hits so you will actually Macy's now 19 because of my new armor okay so the 18 didn't hit that yeah okay so two crits though and one regular hit that is some hot dice so basically what happens is a pair of shots basically hit near your heart I need that for the pumping and the crits deal a total 17 points of damage between the two shots and the remaining hit only those three points of damage nice I'm glutted but you're still standing I'm up so after basically seeing all of the everyone in the bar shoot you and you're still standing the other people go in the go oh [ __ ] I'm maybe it's cuz I slammed the lady into the wall and I their turn I cast another Zephyr strike on myself because I want to get away from these okay halflings and that lets me go 60 feet so I want to go back the way I came okay and around the building how far could I get right to there at 60 yep okay you can see now that Sebastian is emanating magical darkness so your your line of sight is blocked because the German is there sorry or wait you're you're inside the area of darkness so you can because you're not blunt as long as you're not targeting someone in the darkness you're not blinded by it okay yep no I'm not I am going to I want to take a shot at the guy with the pumpkins okay go for it I'm gonna use sharpshooter but I get advantage of my Zephyr strike yeah and I get a 24 nice that hits 19 what happens um I want to get him square in the chest but I want the pumpkins to go fly yeah I think he was carrying the pumpkins as a diversion he had his daggers in the pumpkins is it like dagger strike and so he draw a so the pumpkins go flying and do they land safely oh they do okay wasted pumpkin that means shame someone in twitch chat asks I thought the darkness spell blotted out the entire area completely not in my campaign not when you play with a lighting designer who does not like that way yeah I the way that I ruled the darkness fell if you're wondering in twitch chat is that it works like actual darkness does in the real world which does mean means it's not an area of ink black darkness that you can't see out of its it's like an inverse pool of light so while you're in it you can see out of it it's a it's a it's an interpretation that's well that I prefer because it actually makes logical sense what is the benefit of my ability that you can see through it yeah because you can still see someone that's in it with you okay yeah yeah yeah so someone's right beside you in the darkness spell do that see me there they're effectively blinded but you're not but you can see outside of it just like if you're standing in a pool of shadow if you're standing in an area in real life if you're standing in darkness and someone else is illuminated they can't see you but you can see that sir mm-hmm good question yeah it is it's a tricky spell to adjudicate and this is the one that makes sense to me maybe we should do a whole video on it mmm maybe we will yeah cool so that actually was veil was there anything you wanted to do you turn I think Danny move all the movement I can move yeah as long as I move 60 feet then I'm good cool the two halflings pursue you around the corner but they have to use their entire movement to get right back up to you million later halflings mm-hmm [Music] oh yeah we are back to the top of the round with Korra who is hiding out in the kitchen and you can't see what she does what's she doing so we're up dude pollute oh I need to know and you can - I'm gonna run towards the bar and I'm gonna take a swipe at captain two swords there is the woman that's on the ground beside you yeah I guess I couldn't murder her but okay okay but she misses it hits the back of the leg plate on your armor but doesn't penetrate okay and so I'm gonna I'm gonna take a swipe at this guy and then I yeah first I'm gonna swipe at him swipe swipe Oh No precision strike I get a 16 that's enough that's we added ice ax blade lands solidly on him 413 damage I slice him in half as I jump over them his guts spill all over the bar and when you jump over the bar yeah I want to jump over okay the bar alrighty you leap over the bar then uh one more thing I'm gonna do my healing my second win yeah sounds good Sebastian you're up so from within my magical darkness I'm gonna cast scorching ray so you have advantage on all the shots and because I took elven accuracy oh my god so I'm gonna turn it begin first I'm gonna target the shield and axe guy okay or the accent shield guy accent shield I'm just gonna re-roll this dice because I can and 24 hits yeah that's flawless it for uh six damage the fiery ray engulfs the man's head and burns it to a crisp firing there's then the elf with the swords yep we'll roll over 20 yeah the shadowy flame strikes forth in searing rays seven damage she is slain what happens to her um I like burn a hole through a chest but it's so big that she kind of just splits in half all of them don't really know what's happening with this area of darkness like they just see the lights go out and they take a bunch of shots towards into it to try to fail pollute oh and then all of a sudden a bunch of fiery rays come out of them kill two of them and a third one the third one is gonna go for the door for the door yep gonna reroll almost a great and over twenty again alrighty five damage the dwarf is slain yep he was the one that got away from you earlier doesn't look like he recovered from all of his wounds though awesome nice yeah yeah and the one guy still standing in the room is one of the guys that got away earlier as well there is also the farm in the door and and that's what he's going to do he's like I should never come back and done any of this again I you guys are crazy good reputation yep and he leaps out the window and run screaming down the street get away if he escapes twice oh I'm going after Cora I'll Jimmy the runner Juno Oh Jimmy the runner okay and now the other the barmaid she gets to her feet and stumbles forward and she runs to the to the window as well she dashes all the way out through the window yeah the far one because she's not gonna run into the area of darkness that thing just fired fiery lasers out of it and killed three of her friends so she's like not gonna have any of it so she dashes out the window dives out of it if there was a glass in it it would be well broken by now so she runs out into the street and we go now to Vail so I still have a first-rate cast mm-hmm so I'm gonna continue to run past the windows because I'm gonna try to make it to the back door so I can open it because I still know that they're stuck inside okay so I want to get around the corner mm-hmm you can see that a crowbar has been wedged in the door in the door and I want to pull it out okay pull it out and the door opens hi guys oh and everybody seems some dead in here and I run inside okay you run inside and there is some smoldering ashes of one of the the central tables and several corpses and the rest of the bar and I look towards the darkness but I'm like good job Sebastian I give you the thumbs up but you can't see yeah at this stage I'm gonna send it over to Pluto I'm gonna burst through the door into the what I believe is the kitchen mm-hmm using my shield as like a battering ram yep and and you can see that the back door is hanging open a jar but Korra is nowhere to be seen I'm gonna go to the back door does it can I see in any direction it's dusk so night is start is starting to fall and you think you can hear footsteps running off into the forest the forest I think we've done all we can for this they can it go home I'm gonna do the give up they give up thing where I stay in there again nuts nuts well I mean is there anyone else in the kitchen like I'm looking for Harun the you make a perception check 13 you can hear some muffled screaming coming from the cellar door yeah I'm definitely gonna open it cool cautiously but and at that point I think we will need to wrap up for the night we're at 9 o'clock as the rest of the bandits flee once again once again the halflings and the human gotta love the hearing guy got away three of them that were the ones that survived I did get the boar you did get the door also I am you guys see a big ball of darkness move to the table that's on fire and I put out the fire and then as I move away you see that it's better I imagine that you you there's like chick in there and then you go over there and then you disobey those chickens beyond the darkness moves in and then like a pint of beer and the chicken and the plate is like doing the like the spin it's like the little rocket and then my darkness style disappears and I'm sitting at the table eating chicken and drinking beer being like no I need I need to relax guys it's been a night it's been a day it's been a whole day it has been a day
