when you do make sure that you use the discount code d dudes at checkout to save 15% off your entire first order recently our heroes have been embroiled in a the crossfire between the hooded lanterns and the paladins of the silver order most prominently over a disagreement over Lenore vaughn castle the queen of Drakon hime who our heroes found in the ruins several weeks ago after refusing to disclose her location our heroes agreed to still go and collect her from Oscar urine the mage that they had left her in the care of Austrian who they had left Lenore in the Cara I know what you said good excellent however upon returning to read manner oscar urines one-time hideout they found it abandoned and overrun by a horrible creature with a deadly deathtrap laughter them in the basement following the wagon trails left behind they have tracked Oscar urines escape to none other than Shepards gate where the hooded lanterns barracks is it seems that following the trail of Oscar urines wagon it moved into the city through Shepherds gate of course since our heroes have had a falling out with the hooded lanterns the city guard of Drakon Heim they were not permitted to follow the trail and have now been deciding on an alternate means of getting into the city as quickly as possible so that they can follow hot on the trail before it goes cold we are now however they're beaten and bruised with their previous encounter and find themselves at a bit of an impasse as to their next move technically we've lost the Queen and founder so we're like we're even on the scoreboard are we like negative then we told people that we found her and then lost her again we kind of bragged a little bit founder but we didn't tell anyone because that would have been in the plus an hour and the - because people think we have her we don't yeah different way of scoring I may have rubbed it in everybody's face that we were way better than everybody else cuz we found the Queen and then we we lost her I I can't seem to cast spells very well right now I'm a little drained of all my energy I'm very healthy though I don't feel any any pain but running low running low on magical energies right now how are you guys doing like I'm I'm feeling only forty two hit points healthy it's a weird way of putting so I need a like maybe a little bit more of a health potion but I'm afraid that if we rest that we're gonna lose this we're gonna lose the truck cuz it's raining today and it's muddy oh just today oh yeah there's like more rain than a mist less rain than a poor I don't know what that is but it's rain which could destroy the trail that worried that if we don't hurry after it that we're gonna lose them in Dragon hime so what's our fastest way into the city it's not the most safest way gluto yeah so we can't take the gate yeah and even if we went around what's the other gates that we can take there what's that what's the other one what's the next safest route in there is no safer than at this point that was the safer so I think the question is what's the fastest way and because we need to catch that trail well we can't go around and we can't go under so like over the top knowing that this is dangerous I don't know if it's more or less dangerous than our other options but it is I would say potentially our fastest option then the next question is can we afford to set up a little camp before we go over the wall like a short rest short rest isn't gonna help you said you're really healthy I'm super healthy so why not no you're only a half-elf so when I try and still need eight hours right against I just don't sleep I meditate triad don't you have to meditate for eight hours motion oh you mean one of these I gotta say delirium the awkward delivery entrusted you with you could drink it you'll regain 1d 3+1 levels worth of spells when you do but if you regain four more levels worth of spells in this way the next time you use a spell slot to cast a spell you'll trigger a wild magic surge but I want that many spouse and you want wild magic so if anything you should drink like it you can drink more than one dose too if you want oh not to do that I think I take very careful notes when Oscar was telling me about it and all I wrote down here more than one in 24-hour period equals bad you just said I wrote really careful notes I think they're very careful 24-hour period there's a little drawing of Pluto beside specifically if you benefit from more than one dose of aqua delirium in 24-hour period the second dose will cause you to take one d12 psychic damage for each spell level regained and your hit point maximum will be reduced by an equal amount I can't afford that no that's bad I'm squishy on the best of days like if you're if you're really needing you spell slots then I think that would be the only way you gotta try while keeping the trail so it's either we keep the trail or we heal up if when you rest for eight hours that night is gone yeah yeah unless we have another lead that we can follow did we get anything from the thieves can't on the know about nothing well this is intense we've ever gone into track and I'm this drained before the walls though you said that they're dangerous yep we're standing at them I look up mmm what are the walls look like the ancient walls of Drakon Haim loom large this close to the city when you approach the city from a distance there they seem quite low especially compared to the spires and the high towers inside the city and especially compared to things like the castle and the ancient Tower of the amethyst Academy which are several hundred feet high but the outer walls of Drakken Haim are opulent and Imperial walls that stand some 60 feet high most of them perched upon rocky escarpment switch dotted the hills around the dran River the walls encircle the city both north and south of the Grand River and importantly there every couple of hundred feet there's a large guard tower that will be anywhere from 80 to a hundred feet high top tipped with a conical Rufe the largest towers are at the gates but also the to the towers that flank the where the drain river is are much larger because those towers also have machinery that raises up a chain fence that goes across the river as well so it can bar entry across the river too and that that set of chains was pulled up and has been holed up for years so there's a complete encirclement around the entire city the walls still are dotted with the remnants of battlements and hoardings the high arrow slits in a very Baroque style that leer out over the wall because there's Machiko a turret and the chick oh man I just looked at how to say this there's murder holes all on arches and the arches are carved in the shape alternating of angels demons and Giants and Dragons holding up the battlements that lurch out over top looking down the city is meant and designed to withstand a great siege but over the years having been over a century since the city was laid siege even in its heyday the walls became more of a decorative ornament and a sign of the opulence of the Vaughan castles rather than just merely a defensive feature Vale mm-hmm what do you think we going up beyond that the walls throughout have a Battlement that goes all the way around the city one that is so large that in certain areas of the battlements and many of the towers trebuchet z' and catapults could be driven it was possible to drive an ox cart along the top of the city walls during its day so the walls themselves are about 20 feet thick and 60 feet high they oh there are a few stories of those who have crossed the walls in recent memory this is not something that many people have tried and those who have there have not been amazing stories about what had happened to them okay well what are the stories because I don't see anything dangerous up there like I've I've we've been going in and out of the city a lot and I've never seen anything on the walls from what I've heard people have tried to go over the walls and I've never heard them make it across the top of the wall so we're gonna be pioneers first time for everything yeah it's true we have done many things more than other people have in Dragon hein but I'm worried about our ability to climb and fight in our current you know position well the way that I see it I would love to take a rest but we're worried that we're gonna lose the trail and that is very important that we keep that trail that's the most important also I don't see any dangers up there and I never have so I mean realistically what's the worst that could happen why would you do that Sebastian oh one day those words are gonna bite you well okay so bite them why don't we make a plan that if anything shows up we spectacularly run away because we're just rock climbing and we're not really into fighting right now as the brave soldier of a master yes that is my normal way of doing things so I'm not gonna argue with you there but um I'm also worried like if we're able to get up the wall Pluto like how's your climbing um I'm not that heavy so you could just carry me I'm pretty heavy negative yeah and I flex and I totally look I I can I can hold my own and with a bit of help from you guys I think I can make it up I'm gonna be experimenting and mixing a bunch of potions together and I have awkward delirium in case of a fight I have this potion of climbing that was sold to me by some really large man and I I've never tried his potion so we hope that it works otherwise we're in a lot of trouble you're trying a bunch of drinks that people made you yeah you're just gonna wait so you're gonna drink both the Aqua delirium and the potion of climbing labels yeah I don't think they come from the same company that's the only concern that I have I don't know this one this one's various shades of brown and gray and this one is glowing purple I think they'll look nice together in my stomach except well yeah you might want to just have like one meal with it well I'm going at least like just something just to kind of coat the innards the last time we ate I mean when was the last time I didn't eat bears eating right now life is a buffet I'll drink the climbing potion first and if we get into trouble I might need to drink the aqua delirium that's a good plan that's a great plan that is that is the plan although then I have just spend a turn nope that's not a real thing I don't like talking not in character I have to yeah I guess the question we need to ask ourselves is is going after the Queen potentially worth our lives I know for me yes I think it's our best ticket to the dragon home that we want to see yeah now that you put it that way no no no thing is is that as much as I think the queen is important like she's like our biggest bargaining chip right now between these factions if we screw this up we could be you know held in jail or worse by the and like these guys run you know they're not mess around like the queen of thieves is one thing like it's a bunch of vagabonds and and muggers and stuff which we've handled quite nicely but you know paladin's with flamethrowers and you know the town guard is a little bit you know it's it's hard to make enemies this early we need we need them on our side so yeah I need to be able to live in this city after we finish this or is if I make enemies of everyone here then I have nowhere else to go whereas I mean there's gasp yeah but I've never been there before you can come live in my palace guys let's just want to move to cast retire it'll be a simple life well I have to be your servant though no I think that we should what so what I think yeah we we need to find the Queen yes and also because all the stories everyone knows we're the ones that found her and lost her so it's kind of odd yeah oh yeah they don't know that but we want them to never know that we want nobody to know that we lost the clean as far as they know we're was show up at the mill we said three days we're still on day number one you know what I think it's all in the PR way you spin the story which is that we didn't lose her she was stolen from us no she moved moved her strategically if we arrived at the mill with the Queen in three days that's all that needs to be known nothing needs to be the best idea can we address the have some of her clothes in your Tower that's a great back as a backup player clothes petunia is our back-up plan okay regardless of your back-up plan maybe we'll call that like a plan are you gonna take the wall anywhere the wall we will take the wall and we will control them okay oh yeah if we pull up our map together where there's a lot of wall in this city you're currently around point five which is Shepherds gate and if your goal is to head back there parts of the wall around Shepherds gate are patrolled by the hooded lanterns but they don't have the resources to patrol the entirety of the wall thus you have your pick of the litter of where you would like to cross hey oh you're the navigator what's in the middle ward the middle ward if you recall you've actually headed through that area before that's where you found the theater district oh yeah and the various costumes that you looted from one of the carts there much of the middle and the temple ward is a is crawling with Knowles it's mostly the mid it's mostly the middle-class sort of districts of the city in that area so there's a larger array of houses homes tenement buildings shops various administrative built buildings and other like Commerce was in that area whereas as you head north around Queens Park garden you find more upper class districts until you reach Old Town which is where the nobility typically dwelt in the in the heyday the South Ward being the more industrial district of Drakon I'm I'm thinking maybe not like quite Market Street but like a little bit more north so we can potentially avoid some Knowles this just we don't know what kind of monsters are a bit north of the beer so between Market Street and Sheppard's way yeah because we also don't want to straight because we have to backtrack to pick up the trail again - right yeah we don't want to stray too far from it but I also know that like on both sides there's potentially monsters which is why we're not taking those gates the one the one thing to also keep in mind if we're doing that is number 9 on our map is the the hooded Lantern's barracks yeah so we want to stay clear of that because we don't want to awkwardly be walking by and they're like hey you're not supposed to be in here no yeah but the next section of the wall we can kind of like scoot around back towards five and the main Shepards way if we can go is that how far there they're patrolling the wall or is that far enough away where they're not gonna be there where moats just past 9 or sorry just north of 9 you can't say for certain that's 9 is where their barracks proper is it's part of its the barracks is abuts the main city walls alternatively we can go a little bit more south but then we could run into some tools on our way back so potentially running into the hooded lanterns or question mark monsters from market gate yeah or Noles but that also puts us close to they're kind of dead at number 11 right that's where they're that's where the Lord of the feast is hanging out so not more areas probably very but if we got over the wall say not at five but to all two wall segments down yeah and then we backtracked towards the wall would be easy for us to pick up the trail there versus if we went in above nine then we'd have to backtrack towards the barracks knowing the map if he went through the gate do you think he would have stayed on Shepherds Way and headed north towards Queens Park garden or headed south towards like Market Square or middle word if we had to take it I can't say for sure yes but Shepherds Way would be probably more safe especially since we go across Market Street further down and it is safe for us but we also know our way around I'm assuming he knows at least part of the city or else he'd be a fool to come back in here because maybe that may help us decide if we want to go north or south of the gate yeah but even then even if we were to take it on the north side where the barracks are and like avoid the barracks somehow it still would potentially lead us I think it would be easier for us to take the side streets towards where shoppers ways from the south okay let's do that let's do it so the same for you yeah a little bit towards the south far enough away where we know they're not patrolling but I don't go right into the middle Ward to wall segments down from five okay let's put the map down nice superb right where there's nothing and everything's fine and there's a ladder is even a ladder that client you can climb up oh how convenient I thought you said there was gonna be a rope ladder here Pluto I'm sorry guys wait hotels as well 60 feet hmm approximately 60 feet the construction of it does slightly vary depending on where the escarpment SAR but - from usually from the ground to the top of the battlements that are along the walls is approximately 60 feet that's a lot if I fell from that would I be on a scale of one to ten how hurt am I you would be sixty tens worth or sixty-six worth of falling damage the 6:06 d6 it's ten it's 1 d6 falling damage per ten feet fell OH sixty-six okay I could man I can survive that full damage ouch it would hurt I was just thinking my rope trick goes up 60 feet if I want 60 foot rope are you kidding me okay hit us while we're climbing the rope but we've got a climb a rope anyway well you got to climb a rope anyways yeah imagine you had a rope that went up and then if we really wanted to we just hang out there for a minute Wow do that or we can do we want to be silent as were climbing or none where we can just go man if you just had a 60-foot rope that we could climb up what do you think what do you think Sebastian I mean I'm just excited to drink this potion hopefully climb this wall without a rope we're gonna see how that works you'd rather just knuckle it I mean you're you're you're the one who doesn't have a potion of climbing so well I'm all for assisted climbing well we're gonna help you yeah is it gonna kill your spell slots it'll kill my best spell slot yeah so I'm wondering maybe plan that's CC yeah it's in-between have it on the ready so then I have to grab as I fall to my doom or if I fall I can just climb back up that rope that guys I get up and I'm like ow yeah that's what I mean yeah yeah as like a okay well I'm obviously not climbing the wall let's do the rope trick it's always good to have backup when one of your plans it's a wall come on man we're this is dangerous here it's serious this is super serious business I mean I have a climbing speed so and I put out my claws and I'm like with these I have 50 feet of rope and these keys and pipe tightens Pete Pete but the p-word iron spikes that you can drive into the wall that one and I have a hammer and I love hammering things all righty for you team so your headset what into the city is talking about alongside the ramshackle buildings which are little more than a story tall close to this close to the city wall there's a little bit of a dead zone between the buildings and the city wall proper an area of rocky outcrops and crabgrass where the remains of several ditches have been dug intermittently these city walls were never surrounded by a moat proper but in ages past dishes had been dug during sieges in front of the city wall many of them now just fill in holes again it's been over a hundred years since the city was laid siege the area here there is a singular square tower reaching up another 20 feet above the wall about it on each corner there is this rusted kind of green metal of the hammered of hammered copper and brass decorating the tower carved in place in the shape of draconic wings and then again all along underneath along the walls the defensive purpose of the walls originally had been now decorated with these baroque sculptures of gargoyles and angels and demons and various giants that are holding up the battlements themselves always something that was mocked by the people of Drakon hime as they felt what good is a statue against a siege weapon but the Vaughn castles were not known for their pragmatism but it looks pretty it does okay so what's our plan for actually climbing well you have a climb so I just grabbed the stones I'm gonna drink a potion are you just gonna like hammer in well if you help you hammer yeah I think if you guys go ahead and hammer them in and tie in rope then my life is thousand percent easier I'm very good at hammering both of you know I actually have no idea I've never used tools before together why do you think that it was called crow and his son before I came are you going to hammer and I just miss he called a Crone son originally for me I failed I got shipped off to boarding school and then his new son took over as a good blacksmith I tried I tried making a suit of armor once then he never let me near the forge again hmm my other thing is I have my mic hook shot my grapple shot so I know like and I look up do I see any like wood along the top there are the remnants of some hoardings in some places again those pieces of wood are about 60 feet up okay they said I climb halfway I can then pull myself up how fast can I climb rope how fast you can you climb rope without a climbing speed your climb speed is a half of your ground speed so if it's 60 feet that means it takes about four turns for me to climb if one of you guys got to the top and put down a 50 foot rope I have to just make it up the first ten and then I could climb the rest of it we could pull you up after opposites didn't try to oh yeah right yeah okay so I could wait for you guys to get to the top it's just that that could be potentially four rounds of no Pluto if there's something up there it is made a little more difficult by the fact that these walls as work masonry stone that are designed to have a defensive feature although one that has largely fallen into ruin they are if you're going to be hammering those spikes into the wall it is solid work stone so that may slow down your process at least necessary in spending in action to secure those if you want wish to do that and you'll need something to assist your climb whether it is iron spikes and rope or a potion of climbing or BeOS abilities because those aren't necessary to assist that climb just grabbing on to the walls there's some things where things have broken away but as long as there's some form of assistance you'll be able to make progress I'm even wondering if there are places where it has broken away can you take some dirt and mold it into something that can at least be as long as it's loose stone and not not solid stone I can excavate sections of the wall yeah is there a section of the wall that looks a little bit more roughed up than some of the others not a section where there's enough purchase there are ruins sections of the wall along the south side of the city though wow that's too far I can at least mold earth at the bottom to give us a five foot headstart hmm I would actually help cuz then I only have to jump five feet to get to the rope I do it I move some dirt and form a mound for us to start climbing from okay good job mold mold some earth and get a little bit of a ramp unless there's a shovel nearby you spent two days making a giant 50 foot hours in ramp yeah I could if you guys give me two days now and then it turns out that resting was just easier okay are we we got this are we ready feel super-confident which is usually what happens when we fall into a trap so let's do it I'm also feeling very confident like I said there's nothing bad that I've seen on these walls yeah and you're I see everything even in the never missed a single thing they have you been next to me the whole time yes Danny right they're breathing down your neck eating did not see her there anyway I've seen sorry I've heard rumors of what has been seen by people being thrown back over the wall when they've tried to climb all right let's go let's just hope they throw us on the other side and then it's mission accomplished throw me and if I hit a roof then it's like oh good so I guess after you alright here we go okay well we claw at the same time cuz we're gonna both help put ropes up for loot all right okay I pull out my potion of climbing and I swing it back and I'm starting to climb like come on tastes like gravel it tastes like gravel gravel like gravel gravel yeah it tastes like gravel mixed with gravel no I don't know if other countries I think gravel might be a Canadian thing oh I think so yeah I think it I think it might be like chalky yeah it's yeah grab gravel is like a very chalky mediciney sort of taste to us how does your stomach feel I don't know like a bunch of rocks are tumbling around in there yeah superb so you begin the climb pulling your way out the escarpment at the base of the city walls can I ask when I drink the potion of climbing am i like spider Manning up the wall I imagine that as you drink the potion of climbing what happens is the tips of your fingers become like gravel spikes almost and you can just latch into the wall itself I'm so cool alright I'm climbing up and I'm like get the buffed after this and I'm shooting encouraging words from the bottom wait not shouting no I'm not shouting I'm whispering I'm like Shh you're doing great so the two of you start climbing together Pluto what are you doing man shouting encouragement beyond encouraging words I'm also just looking out along the top I know I don't have a great vantage point but I'm spinning I'm constantly spinning looking around in every direction and then also reverse spinning so I don't get dizzy cuz that's how you don't get dizzy so every time I spend three times one way I spend three times the other way [Music] watch out math okay and when are you gonna start are you is the idea that these were gonna climb up and toss a rope down to you we're gonna go like one movement speed up hammer in some of some spikes and then like tie a rope to them and lower it so that he is I see I see your climb okay and see around your waist don't buy one movement speed up you mean you're going 1/4 up earth Oh or half way out do half thirty feet yeah if you half and then the other half then it's good that's true okay and then you know what I can do is if I go half and then I can well I don't know if there's a knee is their purchase place for my grapple shot there was what we talked about other being would once you're halfway up the wall when you look straight up you can see one of the murder holes underneath you could try to fire your grapple shot such that it goes through the murder hole and latches on inside okay it would be a difficult shot but you could go for it give it a go at least put a rope down and you can like camera I don't know we're saying we're like having this conversation while climbing up the wall do we make it the 30 feet just fine yeah you climber up the first 30 feet and start hammering in the iron spikes to get ready the Rope down it's a good thing my feet are also spikes and then veía what do you are you going to go for it I'm gonna go for it but I'm also like looking around just like being really like fidgety about like being on the worst call cuz I'm expecting like at any moment something's gonna come out and just like scoot me off the wall okay I'm just like okay we're doing this yeah yeah I got a spike in here kind of and I take my crapple we call it either okay gravel shot and I tried to aim it and shoot mm-hmm okay it's like trying to hit a bull's-eye but go for it wait you're leaving me here hammering alone goodbye you're a full attack bonus oh I use sharpshooter 22 so with that masterful shot the line of the grapple shot fires straight up latches through the the up the murder hole and grabs into place on the the bit of the stone the stone work it's a perfect shot and the immediately when it lands into place is gonna start reeling you up I'm there in the wall and I'm like wait you were supposed to help me have her and you're just gone and I'm like okay thanks Jo so your rate underneath the overhang of the battlements dangling on the edge of the the grapple in between these arches and these two muscle looking Atlas like figures that are holding up the Battlement overheads and I just go hey are you doing like looking at it like hey how you doing and I'm like waiting for a reply do I hear any reply if you do it's stone cold another is on fire so I'm kind of like on the edge up in between yeah please okay um I is there anything like is the hole big enough for me to put my hand where I can like tire rope the the hole is big enough that you could probably fit your hands because you don't wear any armor on your on your hands you're skinny yeah yeah in a very much like a cat pine through the hole of a box sort of way although the hole is slightly longer than is longer than your arm itself so only your arm would be able to fit in through the bottom and it kind of curves a bit so if I were to take a rope in my hand and toss it over the edge would it come over or do I not have enough leeway if you toss the rope over the battlements as you have you could talk yeah you could either try to loop the rope around one of the battlements yeah tie a loop and throw it over or if you have a grapple that it can secure to if on the rope that would do it as well I I don't think I have a grapple camera um what about a weapon like a dagger or something with weight that you could throw over sorry you know what I'll just start to climb around the Battlement and try to get over top is I figure I'll try to get the rope attached to something when I get up there okay yeah you clamor over the battlements it's a difficult climb give me an athletics check nice team because I'm a minus one okay clamor over the battlements grabbing on to the edge of the arrow slit pulling yourself up and over and into place what are the two of you doing well this happens I've been hammering a spike into the wall this whole time alone and I tie a rope around the spike and I lower it down for for Pluto cool and then I I call down I'm like can you climb that I'm gonna give it a good pull did he hammer it it's solid yeah you did it this is this is the strongest I've ever been in my life thank my father for that he taught me how to hammer spikes into walls once hope it up good luck what are you doing hammering well whatever it was whatever class I'm gonna start to climb up to the halfway point okay and I'm gonna keep climbing up okay as the two of you climb and as veo clamors over the top of the Battlement Pluto and Sebastian you can make perception jacks my passive perception is 19 does that help yes it does - 10 does that help you me they're all and I also rolled in 19 I rolled a 9 so my passive perception is higher than my role okay and there you can give me a really quick perception check as well 21 okay so yeah you hear this so Pluto you see this Sebastian you're not able to react quick enough as Vale clamors over the top of the Battlement one of the two angelic looking figures behind her it's armed releases from the wall and it lurches forward and be end it's wings come off the wall with it and it kicks the wings back and it begins to turn around to try to grab vales leg uh-oh why for initiative oh oh no so it didn't talk to you before cuz it was rude yeah I'm wondering if it doesn't know who my father is and Sebastian you are surprised sweet what do you got I got a 17 okay I got a 20 2013 okay so Sebastian is actually first but I'm too busy pluto's looks up and goes and I look down and go why is it my hammer looking up my butt again it's my butt isn't it well I can't okay so let's let's do some fun set up stuff with our cool axe and shield accessories axe and she here we go okay over I'm like half over like that literally like yeah if we put Pluto on the baby one and just as close as you can that'll just help us estimate and let's let's see what that looks like hope that's cool that's really cool yeah I'm right underneath you yeah yeah so and just so you know for the for the scale on the map the vertical scale is only half what it actually is yeah because I don't have walls that high you need more dwarven Forge I definitely need one for Jack the thickness of the wall is correct but the height is not skip because yeah I mean it takes twice as much wall to build a wall twice as high so yeah logic mental logic yeah okay so you're about halfway I'm about a quarter way there's a top and there's a wing you want to place that right beside of a winged creature coming out of the wall that's yeah right on up okay so Sebastian you are surprised yeah so essentially underneath the battlements are sculptures like this holding it up and one of them has basically broken off the wall and it's turning around to try to grab they oh by the foot so as it as it comes up it takes it one of its claws and reaches towards you via to grab you hmm getting a 17-2 hits so it grabs you by the leg and it starts to try to pull you off the wall make a strength check check 13 well I only got a four so as you're coming over the wall you yank your leg forward and it pulls it forward towards you and you're able to hold yourself on the wall between the two sides of the Battlement as it pulls you back and it takes its other claw and it breaks down your back getting only a tendon no okay okay Dale it's your turn you were grabbed by this creature it was just trying to pay and it's just making friends I'm grabbed and I'm grabbing under the wall yep I want to kick back with my feet to kind of try to launch myself forward okay Wow so basically try to kick it off of you to break a break the grab and and pull myself forward okay kick out and try to get not only it off but like propel myself forward all right you can make an acrobatics check against its athletics 20 I get an 18 so you managed to push yourself off breaking the grab that's your action yeah you still have your movement and then I'm going to use my feline agility and run away like a cab okay where are you going to run I'm where to want to run up the wall okay want to first move back towards as close as I can to the city and across okay so I get [Music] 60 feet 60 feet okay so you run along the wall towards the tower at the very edge okay as you run along the wall you can hear a cracking noise as another one of these creatures on the Battlement on the tower you're running towards begins to crack off of it and lurch down towards you so there's another one of them whoa the one that's coming off the wall that we can see is it flying right now it is it's borne aloft on upon the wings of stone Wow and finally another one cracks off the front battlements Pluto you're up oh geez how far did I make it before this all started happening you are halfway up the wall okay so I just made it to like the first yep entry point yeah and Sebastian is still climbing mm-hmm so I don't have any more where to go well essentially Sebastian has been bringing a rope with him that he's carrying so if you want to keep going it's on Sebastian to stay in place it's tied around me you'll be fine what's the worst that could happen I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a tug and look at you what oh look out gargoyles I guess I'm gonna oh god Sebastian okay I'm gonna tie the lower rope to myself mmm and then climb up submit so then at least if I fall I only fall halfway okay you are 45 feet up the wall okay imagine go to the top and around with Sebastian I shocked that there's suddenly all of these flying monstrosities monstrosity is around and I've been staring at Pluto the whole time yelling at him not having a clue I noticed them and I quickly reach into my pocket with my spiky hands and fumble around for this glowing purple potion and I have a bit of trouble for a moment well I'm trying to figure out how to open the potion with my spiked hands and I finally get it open and I just like pop I shove the whole thing in my mouth and like tilt my head back to drink it Oh like one of those open mouth chugs yeah an open mouth chug it and then I spit it out um so I guess I roll a d6 yep you can roll that d6 nice I get five so that's three plus one so I get four yet for spell slots and you immediately trigger a wild magic surge from the deliria the aqua delirium please don't oh no I'm tied to you and as well we're gonna have to roll on the potion misc ability table because you've been by you're under the effects of two potions simultaneously this is just a delirium soup happening so you drink this potion back and you just feel your stomach churn as it heads down your throat like it's thick like mercury and you feel the magic surged through your blood veins and Pluto you just see his what do you think purple light shoots out of Sebastian's eyes as he's his body is filled with magic and you can roll me ad 100 oh baby you know how to pick your nails like you know if you've ever seen we have really long fake nails when you try to like tap on a screen I got a 55 55 okay as all of this magic goes through Sebastian's body all of his hair and like there's poor there's nodules of glowing purple energy coming out from all the pores on the bottom of the follicles on his hair as basically the energy shoots through your body turned your hair white for a moment and then all the hairs burn away as the Y as the magic surges through your body now because you've drank two potions though you're gonna trigger a second wild magic surge so roll another one inside of my body there's a lot happening 86 I forget all the wild magic too and as the explosion of energy comes out you cast mirror image on yourself there's like so many sebat how many Sebastian's there's now there's four Sebastian's total and it's at this moment that I realized what's happened to my hair cuz I see the do please yeah myself and I'm like oh god okay oh god oh god and one final role on the potion misc ability table no longer carrot top one more d1 hug yeah that's a 75 so far okay so both the potions just working with it hooray oh cool and I gained some spell slots back again four levels worth of spell slots yeah we're a bit I'm gonna take to second level spells okay and I'm gonna keep climbing okay you continue climbing that put yourself rate up at the battlements she's wobbly have you come up for of you climb over for me just like climbing my friend and you yeah bald I'm a bit concerned but I can't get over the fact that you have no hair and my eyes are glowing purple wait does he have eyebrows no his eyebrows are gone man I look freaky like glowing purple eyes no hair no eyebrows there's four of me yeah how did the monsters do to you okay at the sight of this the gargoyles though they one has the bearings of an angel one has more looks like a classical gargoyle the other is more like a devil in its appearance and two of them fly right towards Sebastian and another flies right towards Vale I mean this is great now you're doing fine Pluto cool thanks for carrying me little tight you're still tied to me oh for sure if you fall I'm going back and the first gargoyle swoops down to work towards Sebastian and it we have to find out if it's going to attack you or your duplicates so roll to 2d 20s for that for this because it's coming in with both of its claws I get crit and a 5 ok so its first clock comes down basically it goes for two separate duplicates one of which is the real you so the fur the first one it hits the duplicate and tears through it and the duplicate just disintegrates into magic the second one it gets a 16 to hit a cast shield okay a glimmering Shield of energy blocks the blow but to the now I need you to roll two more D twenties as the other gargoyle comes in to attack the other mirror images 5 and 11 5 and 11 okay so the first one destroys another duplicate but also hit manages to hit the real you getting a 19 to hit even with my shield it breaks through my shield busting through the shield slashing into you for 5 points of slashing damage Moneo the other one swoops down upon you attacking twice getting a 17 and a 14 to hit one of them is and that is going to be 8 points of slashing damage as it bursts off the tower swoops down with a low dive and kind of uppercuts you with with its claws and then it's uh is it still within my reach within your melee reach no no to make does it get an opportunity do I get an opportunity yeah sure come take out my longbow as it's trying to get away do you have any melee weapons because you don't make my scimitar okay oh cool sixteen you uh you slash out it as it flies away roll the damage it catches the back of it nice nine there's a noticeable chip as its elemental hide absorbs most of the blow I chipped it I saw you did okay um I am going to back up further 30 feet and like yeah it tried to get away from me and now I'm gonna take my my longbow and I'm gonna take two shots and I'm gonna aim for like where I got it with the scimitar I'm like maybe I cracked its armor making I can get a get a shot in there and I 1313 the shot goes wide as it wings down and deflects the arrow hmm and I take one more shots that is a 20 this one strikes true 17 damaged cool get it in a crack cool the it's stutters in it part way in its flight but it wheels around as if to fly back towards you Pluto you're up I'm a climb okay now if I climb normally can I make it to the top with an athletics check yes 25 gritting your teeth and grabbing the loose bits of stone and one of the legs of one of these creatures you send everything tumbling down to in the disastrous fall your way to make it up to the top yep and then I'm going to and you leap over the battlements yeah oh nice ha ha and I'm still struggling with that is the is the gargoyle right on top of Sebastian yes flying him yeah I'm gonna stab it with a javelin go for it and I miss terribly and then I'm going to stab it again and I miss even more terribly stop stopping me I'm stabbing your images I can't believe I'm missing and then I'm going to try to watch you get murdered thank you we go to the top of the round with Sebastian am I able to like with like get to this side yeah but give me an acrobatics check or otherwise I will because you can use the Battlement to shield yourself as you go over with an acrobatics check I'll give them disadvantage on their attack of opportunity I got a six get a six so you stumble forward and The Gargoyle instead slashes out towards you getting a thirteen to hit no wait yeah yeah that's gonna be eight points of slashing damage as it reaches and grasps towards you as you clamor over the battlements oh my back and legs and though you're all on the wall I think we should move the battle camera so let's let's just pull in so we don't make chat anyone vomit let's pull the battle kay I'm down well we move it and then get it onto the walls itself nice next up we'll buy five more cameras so we can give you every angle I'm full of lies do you forget about yourself you sold me I have a high charisma deception for your life and the game I know that's gonna look like but we'll see it pull it up there Kyle let's see if that looks cool looks good I like it it's dramatic cool okay so I've clambered over mm-hmm I'm gonna cast a scorching ray cool on which one so I'm gonna blast the guy that was just clawing at me right here okay so I pull up my finger guns and I puke you my wave Grammy I get a 14 it collides with it but does not penetrate through it's an elemental body uh I'm aiming for its stupid mouth I hit wherever I hit last time with 14 I got a 12 okay now a final beam I'm like trying to hit it in its open mouth because I figure that will hurt it in the crack there we go aim for the cracks oh yeah I get a I get yeah 20 cool that is a hit cool one hit kill the fire I do for damage I feel shame ISM as a bonus action disappointment in shame and then I crawl over to this ballista and then stand up behind it okay is it an active ballista like it doesn't have an arrow in it but it looks like it still might work are their arrows lying around there are good to know thank you mm-hmm okay we go next to my gargoyles they kick their wings fly up over the battlements again 22 feet you faked your you faked me out there yeah Sebastian the first one flies down towards you to grab you getting a 19-2 hit not even shield will save me now it grabs you underneath the arm almost pulling your shoulder out to dislocate it and it's gonna try to lift you into the air weight doesn't have one more illusion roll it one more 11 or higher and it gets see my rolling one do 20 yep I got a 17 so it grabs the illusion of you and you just see this illusory Sebastian get ice cream no cuz I'm like oh my god and then it just kind of fades away and you look back down and I'm there like it growls and it turns its other other hand to backhand you oh no no no getting a 23 smashes you in the face for eight points of slashing damage [Laughter] seeing that pollute Oh might be too heavy for it this impish looking gargoyle just bears down upon you with its claws oh hi getting a 21 and a 13 to hit okay for six points of damage as it lets its closet around your neck Jo the this devilish looking gargoyle comes down and tries to scoop you up as well it gets a natural one yes and then tries to claw you going completely wide with a seven to hit it flies down you've kind of run up to the tower wall and as it flies down you just duck down and it's two arms come forward and crash in its masonry flies out from from the tower walls imposing though you're up it's right up against me okay um I cast my last first level spells a lot with Zephyr strike so I don't have my opportunity attacks and I run past it along the wall okay so it's basically flew down towards you I imagine that you kind of did like a power slide underneath it as you're casting Zephyr strike and then running down the wall away from it maximum speed you also just don't want to run into this girl as well so I'd say I can go 60 feet lure him because then he I start to suit to him maybe one I'll go 55 and I take my - shah's I power slide I run and I turn back with my long fail critical it hits a crack in the wall yeah that was a warning shot yeah yeah that's the spirit we should probably land some hits like run and I'm just like after that power slide I'm like a bit wobbly so I'm look cool faster though yeah it looked cool yeah super cool just super ineffective Pluto it's your turn I feel like we need to ground ourselves a little bit what's are tied up - am I still tied to Sebastian yes there's a about 50 feet of rope between the two of you and you're still actually attached to the spike on the wall yeah I'm I'm I'm not worried at all you can try to throw me or you we're fine I feel very safe and that's why I use that feeling of safety to stab the gargoyle will you accept a sixteen I will for twelve damage this is not this one actually has no damage on the board yes and it's my magical spear so I hope does it Yelp it does it the the stony elemental height of the gargoyle has resisted the other weapon damage but against the magic it's like flesh and I want to for the first time ever trip attack whoa what do I have to do strength saved e.c '16 I get knocked prone he takes an extra seven damage nice and then I'm gonna start running towards Sebastian can I make it to Sebastian uh yeah do you want to make another attack I will accept the opportunity attack okay if he's prone yeah he is prone but he does make the opportunity to hide with disadvantaged getting a natural one and I'm gonna run up session and stab this thing in the back nice actually I'm gonna get can I impose myself between can I do it so come up around the side and and kind of bare your shield up in front of it and then stab for with the spear yeah getting a natural one but then I'm gonna shield bash yeah it's definitely a one right yeah number 114 I got to make a strange a correct Wow I get a eight whoa and I'm gonna shove them knocking prone or shove them I'm gonna shove them down yeah okay yeah batter them to the gray everyone's on the ground except us all right yeah the other one is still Arab belonging thing yep with that we go to the top of the round with Sebastian so seeing this thing on the ground I'm going to summon from the shadows a hound that leaps forward and starts chewing on the gargoyle awesome Reaper appears Reaper appears and he's gonna attack nice and because there's a friendly creature one of his pack that's new I see you've been five feet he gets dudes also prone so oh yeah okay fine I just wanted to he's also laying on the ground alright eighteen that hits now he's triple Pro yeah Reaper does six damage and then Sebastian says we need to keep these guys grounded and I cast web on these two okay where did my web template go I think it's over here oh yeah you just climbed a wall and shot a bunch of web on things also you have no hair so it's like you're in the costume okay the webs go down Oh baby okay are we won a beingness yeah are we really turning this right around these gargoyles okay so I have to make strength saving throws or dexterity saving throws its dexterity saving throw against web and this one has disadvantage because of Reaper okay so the one with disadvantage is super webbed yeah and the other one gets a fifteen sixteen both are webbed both are webbed in the string I okay that's loves cool the one that is stuck in the way we'll try to break out but it doesn't and the other will reach out to it you're both stuck in there so it's going to yeah it's gonna hammer home the attack on Pluto it's got to make two attacks with this advantage both of them not over ten as it tries to slash and grab forward towards pollute oh and both attacks miss I'm gonna repost that cool 18 for 16 damage cool oh wait don't do I get um advantage yeah on the attacker oh yeah still hits not a crap leaves it bloodied whatever bloody transfer for an elemental creature it is leaking growls yeah it's traveled the final gargoyle swoops straight forward it double moves so it oh and fly right up to veio that's fast and it's gonna try to scoop up no Vale getting a 15-2 hip I'm 15 yeah okay so you hit so we can make opposed strength checks bail 15 I didn't eight so try it grabs you it's got you under the shoulders you're grabbed again it tries to lift but that's really know how to like wiggle out to when you pick them up mine does he does that all the time but if you ever try to grab like like a someone who's really ticklish under the arms and they're just like oh it's like that you should have gone for the scruff of the neck through that I was able you in a heartbeat [Laughter] speaking of which though it is your turn male okay I still have my Zephyr strike um active so I'm gonna continue to like move forward move back I move 30 feet okay you are still grabbed oh sorry okay um hmm then I'm gonna I'm gonna push back like it did before almost like with all four of my paws okay acrobatics vs the ethics 26 I get an 8 missing those goals so I get out and then I'm gonna move back my 30 feet okay and I get freaking out so breaking out with your action and you run back great actually can I go behind Pluto yep come on over with that we go to pollute oh I'm gonna keep myself right here with Vale behind me and I'm just gonna start stabbing the gargoyle in the in the web why won't you die masonry I'm a Mason so I understand how gargoyles die I had studied it I get a 21-2 hit for nine damage nice and I stab it again 13 to hit did you roll with advantage because it is restrained not a 13 like a 25 for 12 damage nice thank you heavily damaged but still hanging on although stuck in the web's and then I'm just gonna stand there just so I can make sure that veo and Sebastian are fine cool we go to the top of the round and there is a sound of twisting metal coming from the tower to the north and as you look up you can see that one of the the filigree of copper and bronze that's around the tower is pulling itself off the tower into the shape of a small dragon where a power that's that was the edge here I haven't killed the dragon before so a dragon of solid either copper or brass whatever that metal is the top of the that's decorating the top of the tower Sebastian it is your turn ignoring that that's the smart move will it take an entire action to load the ballista yes his eyes an arrow I do it okay you load the ballista and I point it in this general direction cool fear I you guys actually you see me like struggling I grab one of the bolts and I'm like and it like takes all the strength that I have in me and I can't it oh my god like get it in place and then you've seen me spinning around and like I'm ready for this thing yeah I'm bald and ready seeing that seeing that siege weapon turn around the gargoyles spring into a panic and the first the last girl tries to break out but it cannot getting a 13 the first one there that's right in front of Pluto and tries to break outs getting an 10 and the last gargoyle kicks it swings back flies over the webs to attack Sebastian no no it's coming right at me it's two attacks getting a critical hits and the ten and it doesn't go by me does it darn it yeah just comes down and it takes us claw and it smashes your head against the side of the crenellations you take you take 12 points of slashing and I guess budgeting damage and need to make a concentration check for the web's believed would you get an eight the web's fade no my head so I get smacked against the wall and it actually days as me for a minute and the web's just kind of dissolve and I'm now dazed and confused and scared and sad and Baldwin involved so many emotions is Paulding emotion yeah and same with glowing eyes that's an emotion glowing eyes as well also an emotion that I'm an emotion okay we go to veo feeling all the emotions um I turned to both of you and I say are you ready to get out of here what he's still a little concussed from that and I go to the edge of the Battlement reach my hand over and cast rope trick across the edge total let the Rope dangle down yes I see down so that way literally I kind of grab onto it and screw up hoping that the other to follow my lead okay wait oh can we use it with a plate thing yeah nice you're in there and I'm in there okay Bluto I I grabbed the rope that's tied to Sebastian and I pull them to the gargle you're coming with me all right make a strike jack 15 say you yank Sebastian Joe it's you the last thing I heard you say oh say are you guys ready to go yet and I'm looking at the guard well because I think the gargoyles asking me I don't want to go I'm not ready gargoyle and so I'm gonna pull them towards me and then I'm gonna scoop them up give them a little little we're together now we're time you take suppose we get scooped this is part of yeah this is part of our training and I'm gonna jump and grab the oh you're like a hero swing down yeah okay going down the list oh okay we're ready make an athletics check because you try to swing down this rope one-handed will you accept the 26 I will so just you grab this rope Sebastian under one hand you slide down and just as you get towards the bottom of the walls you just grab your hand tight enough to stop the fall and land solidly on yes I am it's okay little and we're still tied together yeah swords and javelins not guns the Rope has long on the other side of the long stance I want that on a shirt yeah it's my turn what a heroic escape well cool are we escaped I pulled you this is why we tie ourselves together it's for family okay with that Sebastian it's your turn well I was gonna fire the blister now it just embraced in the dog oh yeah my dog still here make your dog do it just go up good boy the dog is single-minded it actually was gonna attack yeah it should have attacked last time yeah roll it now so I'll just I'll do two attacks yeah cool no more pack tactics but it is still Chrome yeah wonderful good 17 yeah and overall the second attack 16 both hit nice eleven damaged that's actually enough to destroy it oh good job Reaper good boy oh I hear I hear like I see bits of rubble flying off and I hear my dog does Reaper disappear after it kills the target leave so like it's its only purpose is to kill the target so it can't I see like a shadow absorbed back into me nicely over the wall and like that as Reaper lands the killing blow this kind of like Dark Portal of Darkness opens up underneath the Reaper entry for just drags the gargoyle in to finish the kill and yeah another dimension and then I turn to Pluto and I'm like are we leaving are we heading out do we leave should we leave I'd like to leave if I tug on the rope what happened I just give it like the double tug the rest of the the rope trick or the the rope trick it just stays in place because vans more like their magic signal the other rope that you were tied to is since snapped off when you leave it a rule yeah okay yeah I'm just gonna hide behind Pluto and okay just duck and you're protecting me all right with that as you dive down into the city walls the metal the sound of the creaking metal stops for a moment and the gargoyles becomes still as they lurch over the wall seeing you on the ground they then stop in place before he died

the city proper as the gargoyles that attacked you freeze back into place as silent Guardians what will you do now I knows a rocky start I don't feel great I'm in rough shape how long has it been since we and we just ended it's like we could take a short rest up in the Rope trick or do you think we need to keep going and you can take some potions yeah you're you're fine with potions right you're used to it now I have so many potions inside of me right now am I still glowing at all yeah yeah you're fine I just want you to get hit with anything without healing whole foot yeah cuz we if we take a short rest and this is me popping my head out of the rope trick is the difference between a short rest and a healing potion for you is just time like you would just get the same right yeah but I bought those healing potions but a short rest is free well well costs us cost us time time is money oh man money is the Queen Queen is money Queen is trying to do board Association we should just go do UK are you okay to drink a potion you need to carry me I'll carry you for a little bit thank you do you need a potion I have to I have to as well I'm gonna take one of my potions as well a greater healing greater healing is 20/20 yeah like I would love to take a short rest but I'm we need to we still need to get back to pick up the trail yeah we haven't even figured out this side of it yet nope I say we again travel through those small side streets to make our way back to out of the reach of the Rangers but I want to see if I can pick up the trail on the road Shepherds Shepherd way we're looking for wagon tracks and big footprints left by our undead ogre friend mm-hmm okay so let us look at our Maps I'm pretty good at survival you've crossed the wall basically at that area between where the six marking the rat's nest is and where the word middle Ward is that section of wall is where you cross over correct yeah yeah so your only a short a few hundred feet from the barracks like less than half a mile so you'll need to either head up through the side streets or along the wall and you want to make your way for Shepherds wait and see if you can pick up the trail there is that correct yeah okay yes you guys making our way like a long a wall until we get to the closest section to five and then heading through the side streets to cut across and out further from Shepherds gate okay okay yep yep so you take the route that veo has plotted out for you all I will get all of you to roll me a d6 please oh I'm also like taking off the rope and three a five a one okay the dream I can't afford a combat all righty as you proceed along the way through the middle ward crossing one of the major streets of the theatre the theatre row they'll you see along this Main Street here you can hear it first there's several large thumping steps and kind of this low and then the sound of a small wine like that of a dying Knoll and I I'm assuming I'm leading this party I put my arm out to get you to stop stop is it coming from ahead of me or is like around a corner where I can't see it it's on the Main Street here okay and I I point to an alleyway they say hide I shuffle into the alleyway make a stealth track here I go being stealthy again well let's see disadvantage and I have to roll better than a3 or worse than three - okay you spunk your way for into the alleyway much better idea there you can see and you go to get a better look you can see there are three hulking bestial figures in the street amidst a mound of slain Noel's three figures each stand about twelve feet tall two of them are carrying massive great axes and we're light bits of chainmail over their chests and as they they turn around they are on hoofed legs and there's fur covering them head to toe a thick mane of bovine like fur over their heads and shoulders they have these large bowl like faces with great tusks a third one is swaddled in a cloak and is carrying like a crossbow a Bastila I make this gonna like and I know what they are you do these are the Minotaur's that typically dwell in old town it's extremely uncommon ie Monty had to roll really low for them to be encountered out this far but here they are indeed and have they seen us one of them sniffs thickly in the air you can see the the ring like piercing around its nostrils as it smells the air around it so don't keep it down so I turn to the other two and I say is there anything we can do to distract them yes what can we do minor illusion yes we need to get their attention elsewhere now now okay do it can you do smell I can do a sound nice no no sounder sight you said no am I going yeah my doing it go I I creep up to the corner of the building that we're behind and I just like take a quick glance and I'm going to try to minor lusion the opposite way from us and from one of the buildings nearby I'm gonna have a voice go help me okay make itself check first to keep your position hidden 22 okay now make a deception check 13 sound of someone crying for help causes the three massive minotaurs to turn their gaze they take their axes and the other one sets a bolt into its crossbow and they begin walking towards the home where you cause the sound to emanate from their heavy footsteps and the clanking of their own armor as they head forward Pluto walk at the same pace as them and we're gonna we're gonna get out of here like thunder steps that gam time timing it like womp womp okay I'm like okay me too you can all make stealth checks Pluto because you're trying really hard to match this you don't have a disadvantage on this track and I am trying really hard so I appreciate that 29 722 well I got fortunately a 6 on my perception check widow takes like one step out of sync like you start off in sync and that also means like I don't know how to walk okay it's hard you cross the street having successfully and you at that point what do you do run away break into a sprint [Laughter] and I'm still doing my run where I mega die still I run ahead and then I say no wait for them to catch up and then I run ahead a little bit more what were those minotaurs and they you do not want to miss they talked about minotaurs being near the castle what are they doing all the way out here I have a feeling that these paladin's are stirring up trouble and it's causing a lot of ruckus with the monsters in the city so what you're saying is we should blow up the paladins well actually you kind of put that together yourself I say we'd be very careful about traversing even the edges of the city right now with all this extra chaos what were they killing Knowles Knowles and we still don't want to come across them so for me of my enemy is my friend I don't think that's the case in this one I think the enemy of my enemy is a bigger enemy that will squish us that makes way more sense definitely and they have horns and they hurt it's not the first time I've been you know stabbed by mint or Horn until I got a nappy nap I'm not fighting any minotaurs Estrella I'm gonna have to kill at least one Minotaur before I leave or it's not even worth it good manage not today though Pluto today maybe later today maybe tomorrow tomorrow okay we just find the Queen we need to find any we got to get back on the track on the trail yeah Oscar we need to find the trail and at least if we can find where he is then we can Scout him out and wait because we do have two more days we could take a rest camped out wherever he is hopefully and like take turns watching for if he shows up early yeah yeah definitely okay which way do you go you continue toward Shepherds away I continue towards Shepherds way until we get I would say almost around the corner and then we want to jut off away from the entrance of Shepherds way before we reach there into some of the side streets okay so basically halfway between the gate and Market Street yes or much closer to the barracks than that to the bottom we were down in the bottom and then we traveled north yeah so you wanted to head up yes yeah so yeah halfway up Shepards way to Market Street exactly okay heading through the back alleys of the middle Ward past the theatre district and all the buildings tenement houses and in its heyday several rather prominent brothels well you know the gargoyle crack actors have to make a living somehow [Laughter] the arts yeah because they're not making it from their little place do some side work outside hustle if you will don't quit your day jobs you head towards Sheppard's way reaching the street from one of the side alleys Shepherds way of course being a very major thoroughfare into Drakon Heim and this part as you've reached the closer parts of the city Sheppard's way is covered with a measure of mud but it is a cobblestone street at this point so tracking something along the this path is possible but difficult vale did you come to the street it is largely deserted there's a few distant sounds of screams and marks the light rain pitter pattering along the leering buildings of Shepherds way you can give me a survival or perception check - or survival perception investigation which ever you prefer to try to pick up this trail again I helped her to give her an advantage or at least a bonus because I'm proficient in survival sure yeah efficient an investigation okay you do perception then all three of you can give me a different check so survival investigation and perception let's see how we do 18:17 okay so the three of you head into the street and look around looking for signs of the wagon trail Pluto you think you might have found something but very quickly Sebastian and veo you realize that well there are wagon trails going along this way there's no first of all nothing recent and nothing quite there's no signs of the footsteps of something pulling the wagon now what we do know is that he came through the gate right yes or at least we can assume what if he broke off quickly after that means that we maybe we need to backtrack towards the gate and if maybe one of us go is like maybe Vail you go alone yeah I can do that and be sneaky and look you could maybe pick up the trail that way yeah meanwhile me and Pluto will build disguises out of more theater districts stuff I rummage through brothels don't stray too far looking for something fancy to where there are there is a rather prominent brothel in the in the area here that used to be called the purple veil and the remains of its occupants are still scattered about there's a wide variety entrance to it and you could gather together some scraps of clothing but any of the brothels and the inns in this area have been rather picked over for one reason the brothels and the inns had alcohol also many things of value have been taken from them although you can give me a survival check and let's see if you'd manage to find something we have alcohol five five spent about 30 minutes rifling through the purple veil I didn't even find a purple veil such a disappears bits of an old brassiere and some lacy pantyhose and some dresses various skirts and Nobles outfits from a few people there's some playing cards I make a mask of all of my cards it's not a full set that's fight you're able to mash one together from several different sides something nice for the rapids yeah all of this is for him this this whole way many of the buildings along Shepards way as it's one of the the hooded lanterns primary patrol zones the hooded lanterns strip them from value most things of value and even for the hood and lanterns articles of clothing are valuable just for what they can use to patch together things to wear and anything so well there are bits and pieces of things here and there there's very little left understandable and I'm going to slink my way back through some of the back alleys in to get closer to the gate okay in order to see if I can see where the trail went whether it went straight or whether it went off mmm towards one of the directions proceeding along the south side are you taking the rooftops are you taking the streets how are you proceeding are you you guys are waiting back at the brothel right uh yeah um what was the light look like right now it's uh it's around 4:00 in the afternoon so there's a good level of light it's overcast and light rain so visibility is probably about 300 or 400 feet um and how tall are the buildings most of the buildings are on Shepherds Way are one or two stories tops with the barracks itself its highest tower is about 80 feet tall and so it has a very good view of the area around here what's probably take the streets then only because even if I'm on the tops the lanterns will probably see me okay I want to slink down in the shadowy esta valley ways that I can find okay heading down the wide Shepherd's way following the the back alleys along it you come to the barracks again it's inside the city walls it's its own set of courtyard walls which abut the main city walls and then there is a small kind of sortie gate beside the main gate of the city that leads from the city gate or Shepherds away into the barracks and then the barracks itself has its own main gate off to the side and then its own keeping buildings inside its own courtyard you can see that many of the hooded lanterns are still on patrol in the area you catch sight of several of them watching on the walls both out towards the city prop the outskirts of the city and inside the city too and as you follow along these the this way there is right up along Shepards way there is no sign of Oscars waggon along Shepards way until you get close to the gate where you can see what might be the trail give me a perception checking twenty-one okay you first looked towards the gate where you can see very clearly the impression of a recent set of wagon tracks moving along in the mud the tracks stop by the sortie gate and then continue along Shepards way past the barracks then turn up along the side street which runs along the barracks walls the the inner walls of the barracks in the in the northward direction where the other set of barracks gates are okay and I see them go off into the side street yeah okay I run back to get the rest of the group I say I'm trying on some clothes I found it goes along inside of the derrick it's a good color on you I'd like to think that I've found a nobleman's suit and now I'm I look I don't even look like Sebastian Crowe anymore I'm bald glowing purple eyes with a nice suit and a monocle that's a rather convincing disguise in fact when you see him you don't quite recognize him who are you who I'm working on that this Oh I'm Sebastian Crowe wait wait you don't even look like yourself okay if we find out if we find out that he's gone back into the hooded Lantern's base I can knock on their door pretending to be somebody else and tell them I have an appointment with Oscar but then they're gonna wonder hang on to the city yeah I'm worried look I have a monocle my name is Cornelius Mortimer Bigsby and I have an appointment with Oscar you're I'm honestly I'm sold plan D are you sure it's not playing a it really good at like okay so let's see where the charts go actually let's get a bit closer to that and then the only thing I'm worried about is Pluto your your how loud clunking you are I don't even remember the name I just said something Mortimer corn Cornelius Cornelius Mortimer oh that's too bad you better mind a magic cuz I this guy's Cornelius yes okay it's working you're getting into character I say if we get caught definitely we'll put you first and we'll try to hide sound good Pluto yeah yeah okay I'll try to hold up the back end because I don't want to go traversing around to find the tracks if if it leads me off and I can't come back oh so I'm even wondering if still stay a little bit of a distance away and we'll see where they go and then I'll come back and get you every time we find out I'm already regretting so you're gonna head along the northern edge of Shepards way yeah towards collecting them and bringing them back this way indeed even one pull them through the side streets along the northern edge of Shepards way towards the main gate to the barracks and it's at this moment that your that your heart sinks for the wagon trail goes into the hooded Lantern's barracks son of a biscuit guys it's time for Cornelius sorry babe it's just I've been around you for yeah I think yeah Cornelius we need to what's the worst that could happen right okay let's let's just share up some of your backstory where were you born I was born here nope I was born in Illyria and who is your mum and dad my mother was Mortimer Cornelius Bigsby I never knew my mother that's my father's name sorry Cornelius order were Bigsby the second I'm yes Cornelius Mortimer Bigsby the second my father was also Cornelius Mortimer Biggs me but he was the first and in what was his profession he was a potions inspector and what brings you to Jack and I'm I am here investigating strange potions I heard that there's quite a brew here in Drakon high well you know what you've convinced me so and how do you know Oscars here word travels in these parts and I've heard that he makes the best delirium potions this side of Illyria yes well they owe me I guess it's moving from Wendy to play name it just got bumped up all four notches that's coasting like almost a fail to like like above-average wow this is probably one of our better plans to be honest do you have an escape plan no no it's needs no escape plan he's a man of dignity oh wait question do you have oh the delirium potions don't work on me like 20 of his spells all back and I can disguise myself I can come in with you but no actually Oh do you have okay we need to come up with a safe word what's your safe words like chops that might give us away sandwiches we have any pork chops sandwiches really boom it really good all right guys stay back we're gonna do this I walk up to the door of the barracks how close can we be with that main gate of the barracks as soon as you step out of the alley someone will see you and how Co how close can be and Bayeux be can we be watching from like a window from a closeby shop right yeah use the Monica so Sebastian we're wearing your disguise but what are you keeping on your person my wand okay is in my back pocket and I'm gonna hold your bag holding whatever rings I'm still wearing my rings okay Cubans are in the Drac and I'm one inside so that it's that's the Queen's ring isn't it yeah I turned that one inside so that it just looks like a band if the actual symbol is on the inside of my hand okay and now it just looks like a gold band that I'm wearing I'm married okay oh what's your wife's name Cornelia Kathy Kathy BG Connie Connie Bigsby did you Wilma rube are prettier in your defense these are pretty illyrian names so I'm sorry I gave that away by the way if I start doing this I swear Sebastian is not laughing we'll we'll see how good your deception check sign that me okay so I walk up to I walk out of the alley with my wand a nice suit a monocle bald head well yeah it's are you going so this the suit that you found was basically on a corpse yeah so it looks roughed out yes okay so you stumble out into the alleyway and immediately there is a reaction from the hooded lanterns manning the the gate the gate is open right now and there's two of the hood lanterns are there with their crossbow one with a crossbow one with a spear and shield and as you approach the one lowers it holds this shield forward they don't aim their weapons at you but they say you they're bad men what are you doing oh thank god other humans or elf or the other humanoids it's been a rough walk through dragon hime this morning who are you what are you doing here in the on this side of the city ah my name is Cornelius Mortimer Bigsby I am in search of wonderful potions they are you up and down make a deception check with advantage 19 they look at you they see your glowing eyes and like the traces of the delirium going and one of them turns to say there's us this man's mad he's suffering from delirium sickness like good stric'ly and they they come towards you ends and one of them you'll so quickly get blankets no no that won't call the hospice the medics we've got someone that's very very ill I'm looking for Oscar yarn as you say that name they stopped I came from Illyria my father Mortimer Cornelius Mortimer Bigsby the first was a potions inspector his dying words were you'll never find potions quite like the ones in Drakon Heim I've gone searching for the greatest potions ever I've heard that they've made potions out of delirium I've been walking through Drakon Heim for a few days hence why my clothes are so tottered I ran into a few different crazy creatures but a little rat told me that Oscar yarn makes the greatest delirium potions in all of trackin Heim so I've been wandering around looking for him I was led here they look back at each other and they they the two guards both with their their helmets and cloaks down they say sir we can help you find Oscar urine but you're you're safe here you're welcome you can come in and we'll we'll have to talk to our captain on the watch we'll get you the help that you need you're you look very very ill oh I'm quite fine thank you why are your eyes glowing will you see I've been testing my own delirium potions they've worked wonders by the gods all right are you are you armed do you have cells I know a few I've dabbled in it a wee bit of magic all right well you can come in and we'll we'll see to you right right away come come on in wonderful Oh God I glanced over my shoulder at where they're hiding I'm just like and they call out captain captain we've we've another cos come in from the city and stepping into out from one of the guard towers is Petra she steps down and she looks at the other to say this is just a crazy day I'm sorry sir make a deception chair because Petra see it sees you still with advantage yep 26 she stops Ramone she says my name is Petra I'm one of the captains of the hooded lanterns here I'm Manning the garrison right now you're under my protection we can help you with whatever you need you were in the city you were wandering around are you all right of course I'm all right how did you I'm going to bring you to the infirmary right away and we'll see to it that you're you're taken care of I'm very healthy actually either I'm in good health right now I I'm just here to speak to officer yarn you're looking for Oscar urine yes I understand he's the greatest potions maker in Drakon Heim I was told to go to him to buy potions he wasn't at his home so I've been wandering through Drakon I'm looking for him and a little rat told me that he might be here that she grabs you pulls you close how do you know that name like I said his his he's the greatest potions Creator in all of Drakon hein everybody knows to go to Oscar for potions health potions why did you come here like I said a little rat told me I've been wandering in the city looking for clues what rat the rats speak in Drakon hein yes one of them I didn't ask it's name I just called it rat I didn't think to ask a rat it's name I've never seen a talking rat before but come with me she brings you into the barracks courtyard she turns to the other two guards keep an eye out and she brings you into the barracks they'll Pluto how do you react well we can always find a new sorcerer like it well start I'll put up posters tomorrow you're doing wonders for Wilma um I turned to you and I say well are they just gonna kick us out right away if we go in there I mean they know us they didn't let us through but they didn't say we could be in the city yeah and what if we can you think of any reason why maybe we're looking for Cornelius it could be like we could husband from far away he's from Illyria maybe he's maybe he's working with the like maybe we recruited him I'm just gonna be mad at us if she sees us I think if anything we have to kind of play it out and I think it's a story for where Sebastian is yeah I'm wondering if we should we wait like should we be ready I think we should wait if anything is there you might have to be the one that goes in I mean it wondering if there's even a better vantage point for being able to like see through the gate rather than being on a side street like in one of theirs it's the only possible place where you could see over into the courtyard would be on the walls themselves there's no go around the the city barracks there are no buildings that are higher than the walls of the barracks I mean uh are you going up when I look around if I were to climb on part of the wall is there a vantage point where I am cutting off the view from the other issues there's a few possible places that you could do that you have to be very fast hey that's like that's you you could climb up one of the latrine shoots you know we do it yeah it's actually pretty normal no we're like I I kind of scout my eyes around and I find like the best vantage point for me to just like scoot up and just like Neiman I out it would be on one of the intersections between the like it would be along one of the sides of the walls you'd have to scan for when the guards patrol properly because anywhere there's always gonna be someone that's gonna be able to see you skirt skirting up the walls so you're gonna have to move fast mm-hmm and quick because there's nowhere to hide when you're climbing up the walls you're just relying on not being seen when you go up which is why along one of the sets of towers going down into a ditch over a suturing there is a set of latrine tunnels that come out of the walls so you could try climbing up one of those you know Marcus yeah how wide are they they are maybe they're like a little chimney no wider than maybe 18 to 12 inches like you're gonna be squishing to climb up this thing I don't see any other way around the splitting well right now he's on his own so we need to do something if you think that's a good call I'm with you I just don't know I can stay here but I feel like I'm not able to I'd rather take the risk of getting somewhere where I can at least run away if I get caught rather than being stuck in somewhere you have a disguise I'm at a spell slots what about no cuz I don't want them to attack you at least if your veil they won't attack you they might just be mad at you across our fingers yeah I'm gonna I guess I can stay out here and what's what's your distraction work what's your you're in a lot of trouble and no matter what you need help I word um haddock haddock haddock okay I'll be listening quietly 28 fades alright Vale as you scurry towards latrine shot a tunnel roll initiative 13 okay one of the patrolling guards you wait for the moment when they both have turned their backs away from the tunnel and you rush towards it and begin climbing up you are scurrying across you'll need to use your feline agility to get this far yep scurry across make an acrobatics check to squish your way through 20 okay you almost have to pull your shoulders in and your hands in because there's barely any room and it's smelly I like dislocate my shoulder and just be like um almost as you proceed and squish your way up in a way that only a feline like creature can kind of like because your bones are just soft enough to do this as you climb up me you know like when cats go into like a really small box isn't your like how did you get in that box I see going to like a doorway and you're like how did you get out of that doorway the outer hips shouldn't be and you're like em right yeah I mean so you begin climbing up into the barracks latrine of one of the towers meanwhile Sebastian Cornelius you are in the courtyard as Petra lead you across the courtyard there's the main there's the main key of the bear the the barracks the blacksmith the the archery field their various armories and you can see parked off the stables is the large wagon that you've been trailing it's the ogre there - the zombie ogre not good um petra leads you into the keep towards the brig she turns to you and she she says I can bring you to one of two places I can bring you to the infirmary or I can bring you to the cells you're looking for Oscar urine why would I be put in a Cell and why do i why am i being forced medical attention how do you know you're serious that a little rat told you that Oscar urine was here what reason would I have to lie I'm just a wanderer I've been wandering around Illyria caspia Drac and I'm looking for the greatest potions here look and I'm actually gonna pull out one of the purple potions and I'm like this is one that I created she grabs the potion excuse me I was showing you but where did you get this I made it make another deception check still with advantage yeah 22 Wow what does it do I've only done a few field tests with uh with such potent potions but it appears that it has the capacity to empower one spell casting abilities neat can I have it back it's it's it's a sample fine the only one I have thank you I I don't mean to be any trouble I I just I came to Drakon hime you're dropping this named Oscar urine yes acting as if you know he's here for a fact no I'm just following a lead I I would like like is he here you haven't said so you just brought me inside as soon as I mentioned his name I don't know what's going on she says I'm very sorry if Oscar urines one of your friends he was selling us potions for a long time but do you know him but just the other day we went by his his manner and it had been destroyed we think he's dead oh no what did you retrieve his body no there was nothing I'm sorry so what leads you to believe he's dead is it possibly could have left I have we don't know he was supplying us with potions for quite some time but since the a few days ago his whole place looked like it had just been ransacked there's a lot of bandits and people and we've been trying to protect him well we could but it's hard to survive in the city do I detect any sort of lies or anything from her what's your bonus to in sight in sight I have no bonus not very wisdom you don't know Petro very well but it's really hard to get a read on her well that's that's very tragic I guess I will have to find somewhere else to uh to continue my research you're welcome to stay here if you would like we can we have people that can see to your medical needs if you need any and perhaps our commander is very very busy but if you can make these potions indeed perhaps we can come to some sort of a chord over them it's a very dangerous time to be here in the city we're about to participate in a major major offensive operation shortly oh my what's sort of offensive operation it's a dangerous really can't say any information about that of course it's probably for the best if you stay here for a couple days or that you leave the city I I could swing by the the infirmary um I don't know if I need medical intent attention but you know it's always good to get checked up on ok my my plan just to elaborate is I want to look for any signs of like like kind of peer through doorways as we're going I kind of just want to see if there's anywhere where I think they may have like I don't believe her that Oscar you're on is dead a Blanca an Oscar yarn is here and I'm trying to like look for clues ok as I'm being led around the barracks yeah detective sure um she says very well so you want to ask her to lead you around the barracks what do you want to say to her if she ought she offered to take me to the infirmary yes she did so I said I could swing by the infirmary but well she's leading me there mm-hmm I'm going to look at whatever we walk by to look for possible sure please she leads you through the fortress past the meeting halls were in the Great Hall where you've been before out to the infirmary wing where it seems like it's a combination of what would have been a barracks and is where they're treating several wounded there's about a dozen hooded lanterns in here in various states of consciousness and wounds some of them as much as missing limbs some suffering from delirium sickness others completely unconscious and on the verge of death shaking and shivering she points to one of the cots and says if you'd like to take this and have a sleep or anything like that one of us will fetch you some water I have a some other work to attend to but if you need to leave here just talk to the guards and they'll lead you wherever you need to go you're welcome to come and go between the infirmary and the Great Hall and the courtyard but everywhere else is off-limits our security is very tight right now because we're on the midst of this offensive I understand it's not man going to be okay I point to like one of them please keep your voice down I'm just okay I'm sorry did I see anything on my way over like anything of known holiday no we go to Vale climbing up the latrine mm-hmm so I climb up the retreat the latrine pipe and you are now in the latrine of one of the tower buildings you are covered in filth and you smell really add yeah but you are in I believe this is called a Gardevoir I'm probably not pronouncing that correctly but it it is the the technical term for where the poop chute of the castle that's French hey where will you go from here where is it in relation to the rest of the building great question you are in the south wing there's a southern kind of the southern tower of the barracks so I'm in the barracks you're in one of the towers of the walls the keep you need to head through the walls to the other side to get to the key proper I come the latrine and I want to kind of look out and see there's anything it's a small closet like room with a single door and a bore and like there's like a board just over top of it and there's a there's a few rags scattered about and some straw is um I could come out and I go there's a is there a locking door it's kind of like a latch style door from one side yeah okay and is there any sort of cracks in the door that I can look out of oh yeah yeah you could look underneath the door okay so I lock it okay and I crouch down and I want to see like there's anything that I can see outwardly the hallways clear okay I open the door and I stick my head out okay you're in one of the bastion towers of the hooded Lantern's barracks there the the room that you're in is kind of one of the the off-duty guard rooms so there's a few cots scattered about here some a few chests of some extra ammunition and weapons and a spiral staircase that goes up to the level above and down below as well and then there's several arrow slits a lot along the walls here which are all closed up if I knowing where I am do I know if leading up only meet it anywhere that will give me a vantage point leading up if you take the spiral staircase up that will eventually lead you to the trapdoor which lead which looks out on the tower it's not the highest tower it's not to keep but it's one of the higher ones that'll let you look down over the courtyard okay and then going down I'm looking where would that leave me out to potentially a doorway on the inside of the courtyard you don't really know the layout of the hooded Lanterns barracks so going up or down you know up is probably gonna take you to a landing and down might take you to an exit it is a tower after all I'm gonna go up because I want to get a good vantage point about where I am and again I can always scale down the wall okay with my claws if I need to so I go up okay you head up to the top and you can hear the light pitter-patter of rain make a stealth check 12 okay you head up the stairs the rain that's coming down because the spiral goes up and the trap door at the top is open the rain has made the steps slick and you slip bang yourself in meow and you hear a voice from the top of the top battlements of the Tower say was that and he starts heading down towards the stairs it seems like there are two guards at least at the very top of the battlements up here I run back to the bathroom at full clip at full clip watch actually you know what not quite full I want to like tiptoe cuz I'm like really aware of like falling again on the water but I want to like scurry as quickly as I can okay so if you want to try to do so quietly you can make a stealth check with disadvantage [Music] 18 okay so you scurry down the stairs as quickly as you can and the just as the guard you hear the footsteps of the guard heading down the stairs a little bit it's like I don't know I thought I heard something for sure and he says to Rudolf I gotta just head down to the guard room and just just see what that was sounded like something was falling down the stairs or something says alright sir head on down I'll keep a lookout up here so you head down the stairs back to the guard room and you hear the steps of another guard heading down the stairs one of the hooded lanterns and I'm in the wot I'm in the bathroom you latrine yeah okay and I locked the door yeah do they come up to the door or do they walk past keep going down the stairs he walks down he sees nothing in the guard room it's like that water down here he sees he says to himself looks like watery paw prints and he walks towards the latrine door puts his hand on it tries to open it up and he knocks he says who's in there I say is dead here was Rudolph or Rudolph this one up above didn't hear his name no okay I say oh don't come in okay make it deception check 23 oh you really sold them this is Alicia is that you yes oh you got the runs again don't you I'm so sorry bad girl I was expecting you for your the change of the guard but you just just let it go out take your time all I'll keep your shift I'll be back upstairs thank you [Laughter] that we head back to Sebastian all right yeah Pluto what are you doing so they both have it inside you're you're on your own completely and I'm panicking I'm pacing in this little room and do I see any movement do I see any activity happening anything different no the the guards that were at the front have taken their posts back up again you saw of a Oh rush back in and you saw Sebastian go in as is disguise this is a three-way split you guys I'm sorry and and I start to have flashbacks of rat food and my my people who I led to their demise and I start worrying and I start panicking and I get this idea maybe they need a distraction maybe they need a way out and I'm gonna look in my bag and I'm gonna pull out the shadow goop and I'm going to loosen the vial and I'm gonna throw it at the gate cool are you gonna try to keep yourself hidden when that happens yes okay because you are not moving you can make either you can make it a deception or a stealth check with advantage with it whichever you prefer plus 1 versus - 115 ok you throw it out and the shadowy goop lands in the street and it coalesces with the rainwater sending a pulp will sense of shadowy energy throughout the area flipping over to Sebastian after waiting a few minutes Sebastian you can hear this howl come up from the dungeons below the slope and a rattling of chains and there's a general commotion as several of the hood of lanterns try to one of the sick hooded lanterns this awful beast why are we keeping it here I approach that's that soldier mm-hmm and I kneeled down next to him good morning my good sir the man is losing his hair in patches he looks like he's suffering from delirium sickness he's been stripped down and bandaged he looks in a pretty bad way my friend I understand what it's like to suffer from delirium sickness this monster that you're keeping here perhaps I could help what what sort of monster is it make your persuasion check advantage or no no 23 he looks up and he says he grabs you by the arms is that crazy bastard that crazy wizard brought them in here with him they're keeping them in the dungeon they scream once in a while it shakes all through the halls thank you very much and I quickly stand up and start to walk away and I you said there's two guards yeah I head to the guards and I look at them I say I'm terribly sorry but I need to use the restroom I'm not feeling too well might leave the Delirium potions the one of the guards a slight woman from beneath her helmet she says fine I'll show you the way and she leads you towards one of the the washrooms in the key there's a she takes you up a spiral tower towards again another one that's built into the keep itself opens the door and says go relieve yourself thank you will you be waiting out here for me yes it might be a little while that's fine okay and I close the door and lock it and then sit there and I don't know think I'm going to sit here and think alright we're a little while well and that's where we'll end the night on the can characters in the bathroom one hiding oh wow like am i anywhere close to her or is it a completely different completely different part of the morning we I tried to set up a nice way to reconnect us but know we have to make it
