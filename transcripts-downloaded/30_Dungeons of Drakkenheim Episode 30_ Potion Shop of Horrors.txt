off your first order welcome back to the ruins of dragon hime the battle of temple gate is over the hooded lanterns and the silver order have united with our heroes and taken the gate after a day of vicious fighting against the Noles that inhabit the temple district of Dragon hime the battle one but not over for skirmishes and smaller fights against the robing war bands of Knolls continue to break out around the city as the hornet's nest of monsters through a dragon hime have been disturbed by the encroachment of the forces of the silver order and the hooded lanterns what will happen in the days and weeks to come in Drakon hime none can say but violence has not stricken the streets of the city like this in some time our heroes retreated from the battle to return to camp dawn the fortress the fortress encampment of the silver order to recuperate following winning the gate themselves and they have now been journeying back towards the barracks of the hooded lanterns to debrief with the night captain Theodore marshal and the Lord Commander Elias Drechsel however along the road they have been intercepted by their old friend the tiefling mage of the amethyst Academy River she frowns and size as your conversation continues it seems like we're at a bit of an impasse but I want to work with you I think the Academy and all of us can work together but I don't know what you all want anymore I mean I've been pretty clear from the beginning what I want and that's my father and to bring him back to help sort out what dragonhide should be so that's me I just think that there's more options for how we can make a better Dragon hime than just having the amethyst Academy rule over the whole city and I don't think any one person unless they're an heir to the throne that makes sense but I think that we're going to need to work as a team I feel like there's a collective of people that want what's best for this city and we're trying to figure out who those people are and River I think you're a good person and I know that you work for the amethyst Academy and I know that you're trying to stand up for what the amethyst Academy stands for but when all the chips fall I feel like we might need more than just the amethyst Academy to look after Jack and I'm I sometimes don't know what I want but I think new dragon hime we need to move past this pain that you feel this this this pain you hold on to about being outcasts and being segregated around the world in your domains and and and retreating into your world if you you have to take a chance and open up it's our only way to save this place River sighs exasperatedly and the expression on her face does that weird half smile half frown thing that only a strange tiefling face can do that very unsettling look that is you're not sure if she's going to break into laughter or break into tears the Academy can work with the survivors here if they want to work with us the Academy needs to get something out of it and we'll need to have some pretty big concessions in terms as part of that but if you want to make it different than dragon I'm well you should know the Academy is fascinated by dragon hime and is fascinated by what's happened here so many of us are working to try to understand what happened to try to understand the haze delirium and nobody that's working on it is coming up with good news as far as we can tell right now the haze is going to hang over this region for generations to come and if this doesn't matter if the silver order purges every last bit of delirium in the ruins there will never be a new dragon I'm the wound is too deep and you three don't understand that that doesn't mean we have to abandon this place it doesn't mean we can't find answers but Drakon hime is never going to be a living City it's not gonna happen the hooded lanterns are fighting a battle against an enemy that doesn't exist they they maybe you think going out in the ruins and killing monsters is going to restore the city somehow but what use our weapons against the air that you breathe the water that you drink and the ground that you're walking on this city is corrupted and polluted we don't understand the relationship between the haze and the delirium we just don't know and until we know even entertaining the thought of a new Drakon hime that's delirious that's a fantasy the hooded lanterns and the silver order I did bring up the idea of working with the amethyst academy they didn't see him opposed to it they did say that they weren't sure what you were after and they weren't sure where you stood but that they would be willing to work with you I think what's interesting here is that it sounds like the goals of the amethyst Academy are to find out what's happening with the haze and delirium which does kind of contradict the views of the silver order who want to destroy the delirium and the hooded lanterns just want to reclaim Drakon home and find an heir to the throne and have this be the city that it was before and I know that that's impossible but could we not have an heir sitting on the throne well the amethyst economy conducts research and we'll figure out what to do with the silver order when the time comes and maybe we can work up to some sort of meeting of the three factions a representative from each one's representing what they want from Dragon hime and hopefully come to a consensus all right I'm going to head back to L emperor village Eldrick is going to be here in a few days I want you to bring the commander of the hooded lanterns in the silver order just them to ember wood village and a few more folks from the amethyst Academy will come as well and then we can talk so wait you want multiple people from the amethyst Academy and the two leaders of two of the main factions of Dragon hime only it doesn't really equal I think they should be able to bring some people they can bring their entourages for security if they feel it's necessary but we'll only meet with their leaders okay what sounds fair I think that's reasonable and I think it would be hopefully a welcome change to the mystery of the Academy also I need to find out information about my mother which when we do have that conversation I want to discuss what was discovered about the mirror and what we know about that because the last I heard is that you were gonna go back and find everything you could and give me that information so that's something that we should discuss at some point I have I have found a few things it's not much it's just some records for one of the other towers but it seems that Lenna theeven tide served as one of the Archmage's of Drakon hime for several years before she retired so if any if there's any more records of your mother they're gonna be in that Tower interesting your mom sounds really important yeah much more important than I thought can I ask you a question River was his mom's retirement sudden or mandatory or may I say untimed more like unheard of I like that I've never heard of an Archmage of the Academy retiring to private life it's conspicuous odd suspicious and other words used by people using strangers elvish the elvish members of the Acacia we have always been the most eccentric and detached members of the Academy they there's very few elves left in the world anyways and whenever the elves are involved with anything I mean they were some of the first teachers in the Academy but they've always well the elves have been Outsiders within a group of outsiders even though they've been an important part so I don't it seems strange she all I can tell you is that it seemed like she was someone that had lived another lifetime even before she came to the Academy and was planning on living another lifetime afterwards and then I happened thank you that's actually valuable information and now I know that that Tower is somewhere that I have to go so yeah maybe the the Archmage of Drakon Heim was notable because they served on the council that used to rule Drakon Heim and answer to the king all of them had a badge of office of some kind maybe you can find your mother's old staff I'll look for it the previous Archmage would have wielded it so nobody knows what happened to him so maybe you'll find some answers there too Thank You Bertrand Oh Jim to the tower all right now our River just to show a sign of good faith we're not it we're not against the Academy but I think we are owed a little bit more information I take out six large chips of delirium and I say just to know we're still open to working with you well thank you I hand them over then perhaps it's worth showing you a little bit about what you could be fighting for here she reaches into her bag butts on a puts on one of her gloves reaches into her bag and she pulls out a one and a half inch diameter perfectly matched sphere of delirium she holds it out we've been making this and then she takes her unloved hand and touches the orbit this is stabilized delirium does it look similar to the one that we saw in the mirror dimension but the demon was clutching it does River did you go into the mirror no I didn't but we've been able to find a way to charge the delirium down delirium absorbs magic it is magic it's dangerous because of it but with the process that we applied this is like a battery can we have it oh boy so it's safe to touch does it have did you learn anything about why I can touch the delirium in its raw form there are the only thing that we know is that some who have been exposed to delirium for a long time exposed to the haze have innate resistance to it it seems that probably you might have been but the fact that you've survived probably says something about your biology that you're probably not willing to be dissected are you if I die the economy can have my body whoa whoa did you just give me like for science I mean there's so many things that could happen with that I should actually tell you the the sphere of delirium that you're holding is covered in a very thin layer of glass that does protect it and protect you from the aftershocks of it but it helps with an it's imbued with another arcane coating and you should be able to pull magic from it by a tuning to it so it works similar to the potions it's just that it absorbs nascent magic that you can then siphon off usually about every day or so you'll be able to get more out of it it seems inexhaustible at this point nito about one last thing the mask rib have you heard anything about this queen thieves we've had dealings with some of her people of course there's more than just you that have been finding delirium forests that we've been buying from and I include some of her people mm-hmm but who she is and what she wants well she seems like a petty thief to me follow a question are you the queen of Thieves the delirium she's mocked us before openly about being like right in front of us so I just wanted to just know that would be it would be highly improper for a member of the amethyst Academy to claim any sort of title like that so so is that like a no you may want to do some digging into her because I think she's a bigger thorn in all of our sides than anyone anticipated she's very sneaky and she can show up almost anywhere which is one of the reasons I think vayo may have had some concern about the meeting yes she could be easily any one of your sidekicks your mentors it could be people you've known for a year she's very well so she's some sort of imposter oh yeah that's a great that's a simple way of then I'll make sure that the Academy is adequately prepared for that yeah if you need to route out some sort of rogue magician that's using magic or some or some form of sorcery to hide their identity maybe then we can help with you with something more concrete yeah if you ever come across some sort of device that we can shoot people with to make them turn into who they really are some kind of crossbow mechanism that would be that's the only thing I could think of it may be like a thing you splash on them I don't know oh yeah I speaking of weapons do you ever have any more of that meteoric iron that you've made that armor oh no oh man I mean there's a whole chunk at my dad's place is there I thought we used it for did we use the whole chunk for your armor there was like a law we'd like to try binding the meteoric iron to some delirium and see if we can charge up some weapons with magic that way talk to Papa carrot top you probably have some left over and where do we see some I feel like we saw there's some in the rat's nest still my dad still has to have a little bit thank you he had a lot well he's also the best blacksmith in Drakon home I'll talk to Tobias when I get back to him but what village she saw the voice of the falling fire with it did we not I think so I was looking and I I don't think I remember her storing any I think we've given it all away yeah we don't have any like it took an entire army of ratlines to carry it over it's got to be there's got to be some left over I'm glad we came to an understanding I think I don't want to upset you I know that Bracken Heim was home for you and it can feel hard to lose your home but everything that we've seen so far it doesn't matter how many monsters you kill this place is going to be changed for a long time to come I know that but I still think it could be in a better situation than being overrun with Knowles right now and I do think that perhaps going with what veo believes there may be people alive inside that castle and we just need to figure out how to get there okay we'll see you soon don't die out there not if I can help him you stay safe River pearl with power it is indeed it functions as a pearl of power does it have any negative side effects it does not Wow oh I also okay I didn't give just so you guys know we still have 12 fragments and three crystals okay we are bigger yeah that I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to give to her quite yet but hey yeah that was a good choice it didn't give me any fish sauce yeah did we get paid or was the pearl of power the payment that was the payment okay but the pearl of power itself is like that's a big chunk of change so that's the next response yeah that's an awesome suite up to like a level four or something three but you never know where this other doula gram is gonna come in handy for bargaining with other people around the city no I hate that was a very smart play there and at once River leaves I just want to make it known that I still do not trust her I I let it kind of settle but I mean it's is it so convenient that delirium will always stay and the haze will always stay and the Academy just wants to save everyone but they also make bombs and stuff with it like gimme a break like I'm sure rivers trying her best to kind of be like a the butter between the Academy and everyone else but man I feel like I'm seeing through this like the glasses on your head I was try to make it something why did I try to make it something I just I want you to keep in mind that River is not the amethyst you know she's no heart of it and she is one of my best friend but the amethyst Academy I still have zero trust for I feel like they have I can agree with that but their own intentions in mind when this all comes crashing down and things go however they're going to go I hope River can come out of it I hope so we have to make her make a decision between us and them and she chooses us I mean I don't think that we're gonna need mages in new Drakon hi I'm Andy a river might be a great option I also need somebody to do the bookkeeping and I think BJ mouth should be pulled from all the different factions like the queen of Thieves could definitely die and yeah I think that I trust River and I trust her passion for what she's doing she could be the butter on our end too though yeah it sounds like she's away but her and yet two-way butter butter on both sides so that way she's working with the Academy to get a meeting so she said she was gonna try and I think if we were meeting with anybody else in the Academy they would say straight up no so yeah sorry I might I might misspoke I I don't trust the Academy yeah I have a good I have a semi good relationship with River she keeps giving us stuff for crystals we find so like that's like a great relationship this about what they're working on today I am I still don't just the Academy itself though I have I have so many concerns about their their true intentions like their plan oh it's just dragging them can't be saved so we'll just make a giant mine where we can make bombs and stuff it's like oh how convenient for you how that all worked out well that's great we'll just I'll leave so you can just go make bombs I feel you don't think River was as honest as she could have been no she was Wow well yeah I miss but yeah I think she's honest as she wanted to be which was more forthcoming than I think other pieces of the Academy she could be more forthcoming but I get where her loyalties lie don't know she knows more than she told us I think she I think she could have been the queen of Thieves and she's just laughing at us and we just gave her a bunch of delirium and that crystal ball is just a ball and you're just gonna drop it it breaks and you're like this is mmm I hope they at least look into the Queen áthisá a bit more I hope their Yod eyes open yeah your conversation takes you back always really Karen Hills yeah walking and talking it's like Red Dead Redemption right you get on the horses and there just talking back and forth that's where like 90% of the storytelling and those games is done just either in a card or a point a point and before long you arrive through the outskirts of the sprawl you can see in the afternoon now the it's become a bit of a colder of a chill day the as you've moved closer to the city a wet miserable rain has began to fall oh that's new I always continuing the the showers from the well actually was there was a thunderstorm than that the day before after the end of the battle which gave the reprieve to the soldiers fighting and it lasted all through the nights and so the the the light rains have continued letting a fog settle into the city largely covering your approach as you head through the outer ruins of the sprawl you manage to avoid any of the areas of conflict there's still the noises of battle being fought in isolated areas it's clear that while the Noles as a power have been broken they may be splitting off into smaller war bands roving around and here and there you look down an alleyway to see the angry eyes of a mangy humanoid scarfing down the ruined bodies of a knoll or whoever its encountered before it grabs its meal and heads back into the sewers at times you even catch a glimpse of small groups of rattling zazz well it seems like all the scavengers of Drakon haim have come up from the sewers to feast on the corpses that had been left behind but the city has not seen this many fresh corpses in some time there was the lord of the feast now it's us as you arrive back at the barracks you are welcomed with relieved sighs and cheers of victory by the hooded lanterns who recognize you though it is a cheer that is clearly marred with fatigue as it looks like many of the hooded lanterns are now on the second shift of double watch and in many cases as you come back through the barracks you can see that the barracks is now being defended by a skeleton crew there are not many people around there's a few members of the silver order that are here as well and a few members of the hooded lanterns that are Manning the walls and keeping things secure but as they catch up with you they a few of them say many of the they say lost many good people we've got many in the barracks that are being tended to in the wounded we've got many more that we had the scent that we can't even get them back through the city because they're so hurt but we we've held out through the night and things are going well the Lord commanders back here in the barracks and wants to speak with you we'll go see him right away thanks everyone for all of your efforts yes at all do a couple handshakes on the way like you can good you done good yeah do I recognize like as I'm walking around do I recognize anybody from the battle at temple gate there's there not many the people that are still here were not were either part of like the vanguard or part of like the reserve force not part of the vanguard or the initial attack because they've left people that are healthy able-bodied and not terribly exhausted to defend their their most important holding now once you come back to the barracks tower itself all the members of the Royal Guard are still there and Elena Krieger nods and winks and says good job did she know you did do I know oh no it's her like do we know this oh wait a second she just nods and says I heard you do well well chat later I got to get back to guard duty have fun and you come back up to the Lord commander's office and you see him there and he is looking rather hale for someone who was apparently on the front lines he hasn't suffered many wounds at all he's come out of this pretty unscathed he's not even bandaged up and he greets you and says fantastic work I heard about all your exploits the explosions on the battlements itself quite incredible really amazing makes me wish we had more like you back during the Civil War maybe things would have turned out differently well thank you I'm glad our skills and and you know abilities are finally being recognized for the true amazingness that we are it was a hard fight lost several dozen good people but whatever you did to make sure that queen of thieves didn't interject Oscar urine didn't cause any problems for us all those other enemies at large that we have didn't interfere because we were fast and that was because of you that charge happened and when we heard it we were relieved and all the Noles came for that gate and we got them right in a pincer movement ventilated them with our arrows and they broke against the rock that the silver order established fighting alongside them was an honor and fighting alongside you an even greater one thank you thank you sir thank you yeah appreciate your kind words I wish I had some reward you in a way that you deserve but unfortunately I only have two I can only ask more of you at this stage who happens we I guess that's our lot in life being what we wanted to be in Drakon time I suppose that's fair mm-hmm we do have some of our own objectives what did you have in mind I hope it's a mutual objective I'm very concerned I met with flame keeper Ophelia read earlier and she has told me the dire situation that our queen is in oh yeah yeah it's not looking too good I want to move forward with the Cathedral and then eventually to the castle but if the Queen if Queen Lenore dies or goes mad what are we fighting for I mean Lord Commander I think at this point it is safe to say that the Queen isn't gonna last forever and is in a tough state but she might have err still alive in this city we need to keep her alive until we can figure out who is next I agree at the very least as much as I despise Oscar yahrens work it's keeping her alive can you make more of it I have some notes that I copied to I can try I can try I'll try my best his materials are down there whatever left that he ran away with can you go and see what you can do I can see what I can do is this gonna be like an episode of nailed it and it's you trying to recreate the book I'm going to blow myself up Pluto Jackson I know it I'm wondering if this is where we need to bring in River because well we did talk to the amethyst Academy recently and we're thinking that they might be someone who can help us with our goals for a dragon home especially with the Queen the way she is the amethyst Academy exacts a heavy price for their help and I'm not above asking for that but if I can have an in-house solution for the Queen please just try I'll try for now I will let you know though that we did make arrangements with the amethyst Academy to potentially hold a meeting between their superiors and you and the leader of the silver order the Knight Commander potentially to work out how the three of you can make a better Dragon hi you are just full of surprises aren't you three three you three we're doing fine I will meet with the Academy and I will see what I can do in the lab downstairs no promises but my name is Sebastian Crowe and I am a potions inventor I think it's all we do such a great job that you just told us we did you know you'd be a little bit more willing to meet with this really yeah yes I know buddy with this Academy right now but we're going to not really okay yeah leave it to me sir all right I also mentioned that you three have levelled up some of your new skills might come in handy as you embark down to this dank chamber where Oscar urine had set up his impromptu lab you took potions adapt at level 8 right right I took the ability to make delirium potions that's no I didn't that's not available well what did you take so I leveled up in my rogue and I picked a a rogue archetype and I am a spell caster now dangerous arcade drugs I'm arguing tricksters so of course with Bao's background with her silliness you know when her and Sebastian used to roam around the city she's become a little bit of a prankster and now she has the skills using mage and miner illusion prestidigitation feather fall illusory script and silent image to add to this mischief that she normally has I taught her everything she knows it's true that's true Pluto what about you what did you take well I've been studying as well magicians and magic users and I've learned how to stab them when there's why we're not paying attention to what's happening around them I took mage Slayer dun-dun-dun and I'm gonna use that attack on Sebastian here I passed mage Slayer yeah I'm excited too Pluto wants to make sure no one turns into a newt or a cat ever again not on his watch in Sebastian I took ritual caster as my feet which gave me fine familiar and detect magic and I found that all in my mother's spell book okay as well after the Battle of temple gates and my amazing use of fireball Sebastian decided that maybe it was time to let loose on his magic that he deemed caused incidents more than helped but now he thinks maybe it's time that he can control that so I took fireball and firewall and we're gonna see a little bit more of Sebastian's incidents focused on the enemy so I'm excited as you develop these new skills in mage slang ritual casting and arcane tricks during a few days pass working in Oscar yarns lab trying to figure out like cobbled together his notes well you like develop these new skills montage yeah we have a little bit of a training montage okay a couple days pass let you kind of work on work on this and Sebastian during this time you can use this time to add two more rituals out of the notes that Oscar you're on in your and your mother has and will say that effectively because you have a ritual catcher because you take this time you could now with the time and resources brew potions and as well veil with your skills now as an arcane trickster you can kind of act as a lab assistant that's only using my invisible mage hand as it goes I just stand there and I'm was polluting the security force if anything goes wrong like this there's a rogue summoning it's also a scene where I'm trying to brew a potion and I'm looking through my mother's spell book and I'm starting to brew this potion of an all of a sudden a shadowy crow appears and I'm like this isn't a potion at all crow there's a crow what should I name him Sebastian Sebastian the crow I mean sounds oddly appropriate considering your name well I mean put him on my shoulder so this little shadowy crow is now perched on my shoulder and he looks like a normal crow but if you look closely he's made out of just flowing shadows and he has pure red glowing eyes and what will you be calling ah man we're gonna make a game-time decision on that this is the game this is the game time decision I'm going back and forth between Sebastian the crow or Grimm to go with my pet shadowy dog named Reaper I think that's I think that's good why yeah yeah criminy yeah okay my royal pets so scary because that's how my magic works all my magic is infused with shadow no matter what I do and that's just how it's gonna work but I made a crow it's not a potion but it's a crow I yell down how's the potion coming yeah I think she'll like that she doesn't need to eat grows questions what happens if I do eat this crow oh that's a great question shadows have no calories Oh perfect oh that's great looks like a healthy bite anyway oh I'll think on that well we pay your bro unfortunately as you go through Oscar your ins notes it seems that the material that it looks like Sebastian you could probably make this concoction but it's not a question of can you make it it's a question of do you have the materials to do it for the ingredients list calls for some pretty specific things in addition to to back see blood delirium and eldritch Lily's there's a bit of a laundry list of alchemical components that are needed in order to make this concoction which include things like the things like salt and suit but it's of grave dirt white crystal onyx stones lodestones bits of various arcane compose like sulfur and incense and even pieces of like an adder or an a a cockatrice eggshell snakeskin phosphorus saffron and several bits of even copper and heavy metals did you check this entry yeah I imagine that at first what I do is that thing that I sometimes do at home and it never works out where I look up a recipe online and I'm like I have 50% of those ingredients so I mix those ingredients together and then taste it and then I'm like oh I needed the other 50% of the ingredients yeah you actually did that at oh yeah I tried to make a Thai curry sauce once it didn't go well [Laughter] don't mix soy sauce and peanut butter and assume it's gonna taste good and well Oscar urine has a wide range of components it seems like he had identified in in his notes he had also identified places where he might be able to find more supplies mmm and was keeping a list of what he might need in there the recipe does call for more eldridge lilies and for more delirium so those will be the things that are continually needed but these specific components the other specific chemical components he pointed to in one of his notes he notes that an old friend of his who died during the meteor strike named Manny Marco he kind of circles it and said Manny Marco the note says that this crazy old coot used to smuggle out ingredients out of the Academy tower to sell them on the black market and he used to have a little shop right under the nose of the Academy where he used to grow his own ingredients underground and he's kind of like circled out and said like this this is if I ever get the chance this is where I'm going to try to get to to resupply because it's one of the few places that you see on the list he's actually crossed out other places in the outskirts of the city that he's visited to get supplies whereas this is one of the only places in the city that he circled out and if we pull up our map it it basically lies in kind of the intersection between the Academy Tower and Queens Park Gardens yes we're gonna have to go into some deep haze to get there yeah well it sounds like that's also where we have lilies right we don't have any lilies so if we could get lilies and check out this supply room yeah it could be a two-for-one yeah one trip two things they call it a two-for-one coined that asking for an update on your progress the Lord Commander does volunteer to send some people out to find some more delirium and even to scout out for for the lilies as well to help out but he concurs my boys aren't gonna know what's what's head from tails when it comes to all chemical ingredients they could find a flower they can find delirium but if you can go well we'll go find the alchemical ingredients I yeah I've been studying this book and this book and all of these books for a little while now nerd sorry what's that oh yeah it's all this potion making going yeah so I think that I can I can distinguish them now and I'll get what we need I think that I'm a potion maker now Sebastian the potion makes Sebastian Crowe potion maker come up behind rope and I press adjudicate some spark so Sebastian with with your current knowledge if you have the ingredients to do so you can spend two days to make a potion of healing because you now have the knowledge to do that cool yeah and if you and given more time studying especially Oscar your ins and your mother's notes if you do get more down tuna teas you can learn more potion recipes as you go and then I'll provide you with it with a list of like what you need to make them can I add just like a alchemy kit and proficiency yeah if it into my fancy fancy nice but you know what we'll need to go on this journey maybe some like rations some like sex they provide you go to the convenience store yeah it's great right rations is there anything else that you'd like to do over I'll say that you can have a couple other days of downtime if you want to do anything else and this time I just like to imagine that we are all learning our new skills I'm teaching you how you would kill me if you had oh so when you're focusing on a spell I can stab you anywhere and you get hurt yeah if I'm focusing on a spell just stab me and I have a harder time concentrating but if you stab him in the neck it's especially hard to concentrate and I've been stabbed and it's just hard to focus on bringing somebody into a no so don't so probably this is great it looks great in your eye but I didn't like raise my hand up to do it and how do I know you're casting a spell what are some what are some like Freight like keywords like where where there's some things I can look for when I know that you're about to cancel I see somebody doing cool things like this and I hold up my wand I literally do that again and I prestidigitator how long have you been able to do that battle I don't know don't wait for me each magic like eight times it never could do it yeah I can do Mei Chen and you get poked in the eye your matron oh here and I like make it appear your Mei Chen can become invisible invisible again I imagine that veils mage hand is invisible because she hasn't actually figured out how to make it visible so it's invisible because she doesn't know how to make it into an image and then Sebastian though he cast mage hand and he can't make his invisible and he's really upset because you guys worked yeah you get it backwards so you taught me all that you knew I remember we're trying I was probably doing the mage hand I just couldn't see it yeah grabbing a tear an invisible mage hands purple and so how do I know if someone's casting an invisible mage hand like this I don't know how you know yes feel it you know the only is that the mage hand it has a strength of one so it's like getting poked in the eye by a baby it just it's very uncomfortable yeah it's like an eyelash getting an eyelash yeah you're blinking you just feel like brush across your face to touching me gonna be a lot of fun you're just like waving your arm just like standing you're just staring at you intently it's touching me at one point during this like petra of the Lord commanders are you guys actually working down here also you know in our in our attempt to make potions we've discovered that vo knows magic I learned how to make a crow and Pluto knows how to kill wizards yeah don't mess with me I can soil things you so conclude oh we owe that as I imagine that somehow like the crew Grimm the Kronos when you're gonna make a mistake and it's like yeah he's my he's my other lab assistant can the crow have a pair of tiny oh yes please so good like The Aviator style yeah the land down under the rescuers down under yeah yeah okay birds with goggles almost let's get his bird birds with arms okay okay well get it we're good okay so what's next I guess we have to hit up that house yeah I say well the the garden is pretty clear of haze so I say we make it our goal to get there first well the commander's sending people to get there oh the Holies all we need to worry about is the alchemical supplies that are supposed to be in this house on our map but it's near Queens Park Garden correct true so we approach from the garden side I say we approach from the garden side so that way if we need to think of anything while we're going in it's the less time in the haze from what we know about the deep haze where we needed to use one of those potions that we jammed into Pluto's chest yes are we assuming based on where this thing is circled on the map but that's in the deep haze if it isn't in the deep haze it's definitely on the periphery hmm so we going deep how many of those potions do I have I think we have one left of the of the vegetal yeah - because we gave one away are those the the reports per G Oh dad that is the Aqua exper go okay exper go exper gia and I still have four four potions of aqua de león I think I used one I think that's three now no okay I'm just I'll deal let's see what I can do there's worse I can rope trick and get out of there am I gonna the good news is from what I've seen they OD with her magic if you if you poop everywhere she can clean it up I can't do that or I can make it worse no I'll make it better I swear but I could make it worse why do you keep saying but I could and then someone touches my face what was that so yeah I guess worst case we're gonna have to slam these into our chests it's not that bad yeah it sound really is really bad the shop itself Manny Marcos shop is on the same street but further out then remember where you did test the aqua exper go it's the same Street Dwemer Street no memories there no bad memories not even any remember when we fought that monster well and well me and Vale like hung out in her portal dimension well you fought it alone it's for science I did it for science I mean I can run ahead and set up the the rope trick in front of the shop just to make sure that if we need to get out of there we can I think afterwards we might need to take us up at the tower because you know the side effects yeah that's a long night I'm quite aware yeah it's a haunting moment in my past I mean we could hope that the shop has a bathroom yeah okay see what happens do you department yeah we let the Lord Commander know that we're going on a shopping trip and we'll be back soon to make some potions and to please get the Eldridge lilies and the other supplies we're gonna focus on the alchemy supplies okay you travel out long from Sheppard's gate from the barracks into the city of track and time again several days have now passed and more of the hooded lanterns are returning from the field bringing with them stories of continued fighting throughout the temple district but over the past couple days they've said things have calmed down we haven't seen it seeing a counter-attack you know and everyone's getting ready for the next step because of this the area around the barracks itself has now been heavily controlled by the hooded lanterns and you were able to cross from from Shepards way to Market Street pretty much while seeing other hood seeing some of the hooded lanterns patrolling along that way and as you cross from Market Street into the air the Academy district the haze sets in once more and you begin making your way towards Dwemer Street you can all roll maybe six four to one okay as you approach Madi Markos little alchemists shop the whole place is in tatters it is a large squat square building that the roof has completely collapsed and caved in destroying most of the upper level and filling the second level with rubble and wreckage you shards of broken glass and spilled materials out all over the streets and pools that have collected for for tons of time you can see poking out from the rubble is an arm and the upper torso of someone who might only be Manny Marco himself and it looks like is the part of him that is sticking up out of the ruins has been eaten off by various creatures that have come over the the course of the decades that his corpse has rested here there's a large wagon that has been packed up by the building and it almost looks as if the wagon was being packed bye Manny Marco when he when the collapse fell on him like he was trying to make a break for it and the building collapsed and crushed him the end the cart by it is stacked up with a wide range of barrels and boxes all of which have been completely ransacked beside the building is a large garden which would have had several wrote alchemical plants growing in it there is a mangy tree growing up here more rubble around it and a large well as well it's not covered it goes down deep into darkness in the small dirt and the grass and the overgrowth of the garden itself and as you approach that is what you see what do you do down the well down well I have something new that I can try okay I read it in a book I might be able to send Grimm in and see in here through its senses oh I've never tried this before but I might be able to that's cool you should try it alright what's the worst that could happen it stops my eyes turned pure black and roll back in my head and I like collapses just kind of like flutters and I turn and I go right I'm Sebastian so you can see the remnants of the building are almost half collapsed and then there's the the yard itself in front of you so you've got the setting here we can bring up the let's bring up the camera show it off which way are we coming in from which ever direction you wish barrel okay so this is what you see later be before you and you see the collapsed building the wreckage in the rubble and the garden and the overturned wagon and the corpse of Manny Marco around you as well laying in the pile of the rubble as if he was trying to run out his front door which collapsed on on him so Sebastian you fall back into Pluto's arms as you take your sight and vision into those of grim you're very comfortable because of course grim is wearing goggles and you're wearing goggles it feels it feels it feels right I feel just the same as Sebastian doesn't a normal day but with wings and that's about it okay where would you like to direct him so first I want to fly up to the second story of the building and just perch on one of the ruined walls and kind of examine inside the building okay grim perches up on the building looks down and surveys it and sees the upper level here the building is completely sloughed off we're unveiling what was perhaps the bedroom or the apartment on the second level of the building there's a few remnants of some of the furniture but the bed has fallen down and the set into the second level wherever the staircase was and all this do you can't tell but looking down the store level that has been collapsed on the store front of the building complete rubble but you can see that underneath the floor here would have probably been the storeroom or the back room because that is where the door leads out to the garden front which is fenced in by a wrought iron fence so there is a part of the building that is somewhat stable and intact that isn't that also isn't overflowing with rubble as well can I fly grim into that area just to like take a quick look around yes like punch on like a table or something and just scout the area who Grimm can make a perception check 14 okay Grimm flies down into the the ruins of the back storeroom and again the place looks largely ransacked but you catch sight buried underneath some rubble is a large actually a really large cellar trapdoor the trapdoor itself is is about four feet wide and four feet deep so it's a big trapdoor and it has a heavy iron hinge that would lift it up and then you can see that there's like an iron slat on the wall that would hold it open and the trapdoor is actually positioned right by the door leading out that would lead out into the street such that if the street door was open and this this was opened you could go right out from whatever's down there into the street last thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fly out to the tree and just perch there and just take a look at the garden and I doubt I can see down the well but just take okay looking around the garden you can see that it is largely overgrown but dominating the garden are these massive purple black and green mushrooms some of them are really big and they almost drive the vines around them I fly back and I come back to Sebastian whoa that was weird as you do so my hand is like right near your face being like oh sorry you're like oh man okay that was weird guys we have there's some mushrooms there's some really creepy mushrooms I'm concerned about those those are in the garden we also have a cellar door that I think might look interesting I don't know well down well why not the cellar door I just want people get on board with champ down though well down I still yeah I still want to go down the well no maybe you said there's a cellar door there is a cellar girl so my immediate thought was this guy is robbing the the Academy right and it's prime he's got to keep things hidden obviously he's gonna go down right does the cellar door look a little too obvious yes No was it an obvious cellar door it was an obvious cellar door no nothing was hidden although it was covered over by some other rubble you'd have to clear that out of the way to open it back up again cuz I think that's right like that's the one that he wants to show everyone if I was trying to hide stuff from magic people where am I gonna put stuff I'm gonna put it in my well well first I'm gonna own a well I mean I can look down the well I have like even his garden that garden is gonna be the throw off garden he's gonna have a secret garden somewhere cuz he can't just own a house in Drakon Heim and have the Academy walking around being like hey is that all our stuff and he's like no it's it's my garden I totally agree with you I do also want to know what's in the cellar yeah we we should go to both but if we're looking for the ingredients I feel like though well um I I would be careful though in that backyard those mushrooms looked like they were moving edible I mean maybe everything can be eaten right Bale some things that's something I learned from Vale everything I don't know if I would eat these mushrooms but you could this is true you know me so well like I just learned a lot I just want to do first I would say the safer bet maybe the cellar but it is under a crumbling building so maybe not and you know my Chan the well I mean making a glance in the cellar and if it like we won't spend hours trying to find a secret door or something if it doesn't look like it's panning out then we hop down the well cool you first goo goo goo goo goo wanted right you know well drop those clothing that you you just you know micro can't see in the dark yeah but you keep trust falling with me so like I don't know I'm just ready you know we can do I was gonna keep happening we can tie a rope around your drift globe and then we can lower it down I can float it I can float it oh can you uh I think again I think I can just have it floatable Oh magic I didn't see anything in the house so I mean I can move the rubble oh yeah yes yeah magic screens with this shovel no you go I can move this rubble you hand me the shovel I just like digging and after you dig for like a minute I cast [Music] okay so I think we're gonna we're gonna approach the building we're gonna go to the cellar door oh you want to do it silently yeah sure and I'm grumbling about something about a well you're not going very well Wow Wow well I heard you say we try to tiptoe but I don't think we need pass without a trace I clunk clunk my way towards the cellar door and then do you shovel it off remover with it I I'm old I tried I just I try to just heave my way through it I just try to lift one rock I lift the rest it's a heavy door it opens up into a wide staircase that leads down into a small cellar room the light from above flows right down it and that the base of the cellar is a very small 15 foot by 15 foot wide room the way the rebel was does it look like anyone's ever been in here since the incident the dust in here looks like no one has been in here for years yeah and turn on the drift globe okay the way what is there anything in the room or is it just as you head down looking down into the cellar there are several crates and boxes that are stacked up against the wall and a series of shelves that have several vials placed on them so anything in the vials yeah I start examining the files looking at the vials there are there's nothing in the vials but there's also a pile of dead flies down here there's five dead flies in here wait a second they start rearranging with there's got to be a trick here I know freaking magic man yeah I'm gonna start pushing walls and stuffs come on secret door fly in a vial and I shake it you put the fly in the vial and when the fly goes in the vial it buzzes to life and starts flying around inside the vial I let it go it's dead I'm gonna repeat the process with another fly with a different fly we put a different fly in the vial okay put the different fly in the vial and it also comes to life and starts buzzing I do my own so now we have to okay when you let it out it dies yeah can we fit people into these well why are we down here we make a vial big enough to fit a person how many vials are there there are only five vials let's do it to all five we put all five flies in the vials as you put the flies in the vials all of them the buzzing of the Flies becomes overpoweringly loud like it's not just five flies like it's it's a swarm of flies buzzing but as they buzz the wall creaks open as the flies continue to buzz and you wanted to go down the well I still want to go down the well this probably just leads to the whales a wooden door behind it I knock on it anybody home who's there who goes there you're not supposed to be here go away you're not supposed to be here you go away the Masters out no door closed no Manny sent us you hear the voice turned to another voice doesn't sound like anybody ask them if they have any gems do you have money Janice yes customer yes yes we want to buy things then you hear the voice we had they say you hear the voice say shut up we're not actually gonna sell them anything we'll just kill them and take their money when they get in here I have my wand pointed at the door I've taken my my bow out we're here to buy please open the door we're nice people we swear and then another voice goes we haven't had any customers

order with that let us return to the ruins we're below Manny Marcos alchemist shop as Pluto Jackson has kicked open the door revealing behind the hidden door the behind the hidden wall was a door that you kicked open after arguing with the voices beyond and you can see before you a well-appointed and rather well organized alchemists workshop there is a large inert cauldron in the center several cabinets filled with various alchemical formula and ingredients and a well-appointed alchemists table with a great set of equipment and Olympics and various chemistry alchemical sets there are two doorways leading out of this room one at the end of a short hallway directly opposite you leads to a set of double doors that have been barricaded over by a set of chains on a padlock and then set in with another bar in front of it and then another door which has been partially smashed in the bottom leaving an opening about large enough for a small creature to squeeze through leads out as well of the space from here the in front of you though there are several strange creatures many of them are about the size of a halfling or goblin even even smaller than that even most of them at the highest two feet tall and they are borne aloft on elemental wings as they flutter in front of you a creature it's they have long hooked noses and strange grotesque faces and bodies distorted in different ways for two of them are composed entirely of ice two of mud two of magma and the other two appear to be a cloud of dust in a humanoid form they regard you angrily as you come into into the room and you hear one of the ones of ice say damn and one of the ones of mud on the ground saying make sure that are the gems are ours as they rush forward to ambush you roll for initiative little monsters we got 20 24 valence 12 12 for pollute oh okay so yes mud Sebastian okay so there we go so we'll have Vale then the dust me fits the magma me fits Pluto the ice me fits Sebastian and finally the mud me fits came here to shop beyo your first or first act what will you do I start by taking my shots I just react I was like what the heck are these things and I start shooting some arrows towards the ice ones because they look the most solid whip ones out there I like your reaction it's different 18 hit that is a hit 22 oh my god the arrow sends a crack going up all of its body and it is shattered not bloodied Oh as the resounding blow goes all through its body and it cracks and crumbles but it still bears itself aloft take my second shot oh critical miss sales rate passed it deflecting off the ice I go for the air one that's why it goes straight through it oh no six okay as as the last shot spins by it it the arrow just sails right past and through one of the the dust ones in the back that was a warning shot anything else fail nope okay I stay slightly behind actually you know what I go a little bit around the corner okay a bit worried about their reactions okay one of the dust me Fitz flutters forward towards the door yep yep and as it does so it kicks up all the dust around it into a windstorm and sends a blast of blinding dust forward you all need to make a dexterity saving throw excuse you 27 nice 14 14 18 18 none of you are blinded but you will each take 3 points of slashing damage from the blast rude and the last dust beef it hovers back back in the room and it flutters over by the alchemy lab and it spins around kicking up all the air and it kicks one of the vials towards pollute Oh getting a 13-2 hit miss it hits hits the shield resounds and spills everywhere next are the magma me Fitz they are the dark red they're the red ones that have the wings they the two of them together fly forward and bathe the hallway in a cone of fire excuse you the first one it breathed but the first one breathes out it's fire breath the second one though as it comes up it sees you pollute Oh Jackson and it casts heat metal on your no armor and so because you are in contact with it Pluto Jackson you automatically take four points of fire damage the other one flutters up and breathes fire all down the hallway and all of you can make a dexterity saving through nine what tip I went to seven seven at two I also rolled the nine and plus two okay so you all fail and you all take 19 fire damage and then the two magma me Fitz fly back into the respective corners of the room how close to the magma me forget they were not within your reach yes you knew my question okay and then we go to pollute Oh Jackson um my armor is on fire it's burning Wow your armor is heating up it's turning red hot you're glowing like like you're gonna explode you're not going to but you are the armor is burning all around you heating you up and because you can't drop it or take it off you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until your next turn oh goodness gracious okay ow ow ow ow I say as I run into the room can I go after the magma one or these dust is dusty in the way dusty and I see air both in the way dusty is gonna get dusted 17 to hit that is a hit for 12 damage Kate remarkably you managed to connect there something solid inside that dust cloud that and I poke through it I find the little gem and they'd yeah and then I'm gonna stab it again oh I mean yeah I'm gonna use precision strike to make it a 4:15 to hit that is a hit for ten damage okay it is also is significantly less dusty than it was before come on these things are tough okay and then I'm going to try to push it away a little bit of light dusting you do have disadvantage on this check although you probably still win oh I have it did I just advantage on my attack rolls to attack rolls an ability checks I have two reroll all what okay hold on you got a 15 and 18 from before yeah who the other the first one would be a 40 no 15 now okay still hit and the second one is a it's the same though it's better okay then I'd use pursued okay cool keep them keeping you honest yeah and now yeah I push it away with a 12 I got a five yeah so you push it back I make I do like a flappy breeze with my shield and I blow it back a bit okay so the ice me Fitz no it's uh the one rate in front of you that is wounded heavily see sees you and says freeze right there and uses its frost breath on you make a constitution saving throw oh gosh and I don't think it'll reach for an amount back enough to hit anyone else 22 alrighty so you only take half damage from this which is gonna be six points of cold damage the other rushes forward and it's claws into you with it's icy key I see icicle claws Pluto ah getting a 18 and 11 to hit misses the icicles break off of its of its hands that tries to stab you they melt as it gets close to my hot hot armor Sebastian you're up all right I am Sebastian runs up to the door mm-hmm next to Pluto Jackson and he's gonna cast a hypnotic pattern so should be able to hit most of them except the magma me Fitz okay so your hypnotic pattern you can't have everybody unless you want to get pollute Oh in it though you'll get them you won't get the magma me Fitz but you'll get the mud me Fitz both the dust me Fitz and one of the ice meters yeah that's one of those this okay so the magma me Fitz one of them fails and is hypnotized as the shadowy snakes appear around them the dust me Fitz it's a wisdom save me through I get a 15 does that save no it's 16 okay and the ice me Fitz gets four yeah so all of them except for one of the two mud me Fitz are hypnotized awesome that's huge yeah I've run in I grabbed you by the shoulder and I'm just like stand back and all of these snakes explode out of me and these like shadowy coils that are even ride in the in the air and all of them are dazed and confused touch my shoulder and you realise it's super hot yeah they're being likes and they there's so much such a menagerie coming out of you last some of the mud me Fitz one of them's hypnotized but the other bounds forward and unleashes its mud breath on pollute oh and Sebastian excuse everyone and the two of you have made dexterity saving throws vomits forth a cloud of mud oh my gosh 18:19 you both save and neither of you are restrained in all the mud but you are very soiled don't worry I'll get you a bar I just clean this close this close these clothes cool we go to top the round with veil I peek back around the corner to see mud filled party members warm crusting I'm just like okay um and I see that the ice ones are mmm patterned right one of the ice ones is not and one of the mud ones is not okay I shoot then my two shots at the non ice one because the other ones 14 that is a Miss nope wait the other one both the shots go wide and I start to run back up the stairs okay I go I'll go 15 feet up the stairs back up the stairs okay yeah cuz I'm afraid of these breasts blood brain yep bye bye bye oh okay so next up we go to the dust me fence both of which are incapacitated then we go to the Magnum II fits both of which are active so one of the Magnum me fits continues to concentrate on heat metal which deals another 11 points of fire damage to you pollute oh oh and then I'm bloody the other me fit does its breath weapon recharge no it does not so the one that's concentrating on heat metal flies up to the two of you and it unleashes its fire breath on Pluto and Sebastian both you need to make dexterity saving throws 1914 you both succeed you're saving throws so you only take seven fire damage but I will need a concentration check there so 19 you're good to go and hello suzi he he doesn't flutter he doesn't fly in range and flies back and then the other mug me fit is gonna cast heat metal on your sword no my javelin is that the web yeah I'm Jeff oh you have a javelin out yeah oh so you're so he's gonna your shields made of wood oh is it or is it made of metal all of this is okay hold on uh Sentinel shield is hey Sebastian what are your goggles made of ha ha is that made the actual goggles made of plastic okay there's no more medal for them to heat up if you're not holding your sword they're not gonna he's not need my goggles are technically made out of probably some form of metal okay he is going to come up and just magma slash Pluto Jackson then appreciate magma slash getting a 22 to hit that'll work for ten points of 10 points of damage total of 5 of it is a bludgeoning and 5 of it is fire alrighty next up is Bluto Jackson I am on fire I'm covered in mud I'm pretty pretty pretty dead but I only know one thing and it's to keep on swinging and that's what my who taught me that trying to think who taught me that some guy taught me that in passing he said just keep on swing and I said you to Daryl and I got a 23 to hit no I didn't I got a keep swinging Daryl who are you swinging at I was swinging at the ice nice one right in front of it oh man Oh what am I gonna do well this is for you Daryl okay remember and I'm gonna precision strike for an 18 that is a hit for 11 damage the blade comes down and shatters the icy creature to pieces and it is destroyed and then I know I'm gonna do which one which one is doing the heat metal on me the one that's further away oh so I can't make it to her can i I'm gonna just try to keep up with the other magma one and I'm gonna use second wind okay you go to the I Smith it's one of which is incapacitated the other wish is destroyed yep so we now go to Sebastian boy alright there's a lot of creatures around here and I'm concentrating on hypnotic patterns so I don't want to throw it another concentration spell assessing the situation look I take a quick glance around the room does it look like this has a lot of alchemical supplies and things that might be of importance if you want to spend your action to carefully scan the room I can you can make an investigation check to try to decide what if I want to just take a very quick gander not enough quick Anders not going to be enough to determine if there's anything of value here okay it looks like it could contain stuff that's not that is but that one cabinet is parts of it are closed and the other shelves there here's who knows who's to say here's what I do Sebastian kind of steps in front of Pluto hi and grabs him realizing how hot he is and then I'm going to thunder step okay all of those little dudes around so nice huh and just like a thunder hop thunder hop thunder hop across the room but that kind of explodes out alrighty it shatters the vials on the the cabinet beside you spilling several the contents inside them but there is a mud me fit a magma me fit a nice me fit and a dust me fit that are all in that area yeah yes so one of each so the ice me if it fails the shaving through the mud me if it fails the dust me if it fails magma me if it also fails yeah I'm gonna use one of my meta magic points to re-roll two of those okay oh that wasn't much better 13 damage 13 damage well the one ice me fit that was incapacitated is now shattered into a million yeah and all the other ones are damaged for 13 points that breaks the hypnotic pattern right that breaks the hypnotic pattern on the the mud me fit and one of the decimate fits but one of the other two is not like the the does me fit in the mud me fit back there by you yeah they're still incapacitated good and the magma me fits loses concentration on heat metal thank you you're welcome oh it's so hot it's so hot and then I back up okay we now go to the mud me fits one of which is no longer incapacitated and so it turns round it's mud breath does not recharge turns around and and rushes towards Pluto with its fists Oh getting a 14 and a 21 to hit oh gosh yeah that will be you got eight points of bludgeoning damage I'm going to repost it because it missed with one attack yet I want to end it and I have no more heat metal nope okay so a 25 to hit that is a hit for 13 damage that leaves it muddied and we go back to the to the top of the round with Vale all right creep back downstairs kick-ass Zephyr strike is my bonus action and I come into the room mm-hmm and I take a look at the magma me Fitz and I say you're toast yeah 18 yep okay that's a hit and because I advantage I guess when bears such picking up all of our days oh yeah here we go oh you're done bud 36 days so the magma method there's like a blob of magma caught in a bubble on its body and you pierce it and it just pops with a large pot and as it does so the magma explodes out all around it and Vail you need to there's a it causes a death burst and unfortunately there's no one within five feet of it because otherwise they would be taking damage from the day oh I turned to the other magma me fit and they say you are also toast I take my shot 20 it's a hit nice 21 damage that leaves it magnet and I skip back out of the room you guys got this okay the dust me Fitz one is still incapacitated one is not and the dust me fit that is not incapacitated it flutters after veo chasing her it's blinding breath does not recharge so it simply comes right up to her and start and says stop shooting us stop hurting us and it slashes at you with its claws I thought we almost had some dialogue getting a 19 and a 16 to hit back and forth okay almost the two claws slash into you sorry for a total of 13 slashing damage and then the Magnum EBIT one of the two Magnum even if it survives and it turns to Pluto and casts heat battle on it no I knew that I knew that was going oh it's hot and you take ten fire damage and that as it giggles why are you melting yet you can see um obvious you know like that heat when you look at like a hot thing and it's like swirl it's above it but yeah like the radiation of the air around me is hot Pluto Jackson you're up sir I'm fine if you're looking at my health I'm fine I'm totally fine trying to decide if it's worth all right I'm surrounded two of the things surrounding you're incapacitated Oh for reals yeah well then I run past them and I charge the magma thing one of the things on you is not in oh I can't see that yeah oh man I might not survive one hit I know I'm going to I'll think of something I could die from this but it's worth it I'm going to action surge okay I'm going to Dimension Door right beside the magma one and then I'm going to attack it okay go for it and I so you action surge grab your cloak dimension door up to it and it disappear in a puff of smoke teleports behind you and I and I say something along the lines of surprise and oh wait I'm disadvantaged whoo okay 18 19 to hit that is a hits for 12 damage okay a major slayer room it is magma eed oh yeah and has yes you do get to mage Slayer it because it has to make a concentration check with this advantage because of its concentrating on heat metal which it fails magic I I'll be honest the reason I'm scared is that if I pop this thing I feel like it's gonna explode magma but I don't care because a 15 that's a hit for eight damage it is destroyed oh and as you slash it a burst of geyser of magma flies out all over the room in the death burst of the magma me fit make a dexterity saving throw huh 13 you succeed but you still take three points of fire damage and I goo I do the react she'll master reaction and I take no damage nice because I'm invincible because I am Pluto Jackson magma fighter so hot and burn and scalding that works right that works you're still alive I'm just alive that's the important thing both the ice be pits are destroyed Sebastian you're alive I was almost forgetting this so grim the crow flies at the mug me fit right into its face providing me with the help I forgot my familiar he's like on my shoulder needs like and I'm like oh right and I just signed him forward and he flies right into the mud me if its face distracting the mud method and I'm going to blast it with a just a fire bolt okay but remove Vantage because of the help and because of elven accuracy and accuracy cool that's gonna be a nineteen that hits that's seventeen damage you blast the mud beefed it apart and it explodes in a shower of mud and grim has to make a dexterity saving throw a bird 22 he is slightly muddied but not restrained by the death he's like I got dirt look at that like it's what I got I got all over month for you I'll clean you up later and he flies background to my show me cool ah the mud me fit that remains is incapacitated so we go to the top with Vail fresh you my concentration check last time 13 you're good sweet so I I still have my Zephyr strike so I start to move actually back into the room okay the dust me fit that's on you yep yes amazing I turned back around to it and I shoot it with two arrows 13 that's a Miss 21 but that one hits there it is 19 damage she blasts it apart and it is destroyed nice I think but a pile of desks what do you do with the remaining incapacitated ones we should see if we can get them to work for us we just destroyed all their friends yeah that's exactly why though uh maybe they'll answer some questions people work for us I want to tell all the people around look I want to dangle one over this cauldron in the middle of it which one the dust are the it is an empty cauldron oh it's an inactive cauldron but you can still do it you know I was terrifying I could make a fire underneath it with the presentation guy minor illusion boiling green liquid as you hold which me fit over top of it which which ones are befitting a dust me I don't know if I can hold dust higher we it's mud scared of I'm scared of water but yeah before we touch it though just to make sure it stays incapacitated I come over and I press 2 digit 8 the mud off of you thank you at least one cubic foot so probably not all the mud uh and I actually come over and I cool or chill a little bit of your arm oh thank you there you go oh my god now we can scare the crap out of this thing all right I go up when I set the fire magic is fun yeah what's mud scared of I assume no fire because fire would like turn it into a stone well I mean it's a boiling pot yeah sour fire fire fire burns what colors what color is scariest stuff for a liquid to be do you think come up with a color that even you've never imagined I come up with the color from space space color like black that's scary to everyone that's a Lovecraft okay and the other one should we kill her just okay so you know I want to like dangle it no no I've never had my bath in my life and I don't plan to start now he knows what he's okay I'll start talking Apple B comb dog okay we're gonna ask you some questions Oh questions are hard to answer I uh what uh what do you think you want what is this room for this is the alchemical lab of the great man and Marco why are you here I don't know oh I don't want to see a mud thing cried who's your master manna Marco and he he summoned me here and said I had to work for him and I've been here forever and I just want some Chad you work for now you work for us now yeah that's where I was going are you gonna lock me in a room for years and leave me there with no jams no we can give you lots of junk yeah well give you tons of gems but you have to open this locked door in here the log door you want to go in there yep there's there's really scary things in there like what well that's where the accident happened Oh tell us more I know a lot about accidents incident well there was a big boom a long time ago and the roof caved in and then all these things happened and it got really bad and there there were all these things in there and and and well swish he points to the dust me hood that you killed swish said we couldn't go in there anymore so he made us lock the door and he made me swallow the key interesting I'm gonna put you down if you promise not to do anything stupid like run away or try to hurt us those the only stupid things cuz I've done a lot of stupid I feel like you could come up with some more different things but let's keep it let's keep the tally low to begin with and will increase the rules as you want the key yeah yeah hold me down okay that's down you know any he takes Jim a stick can i okay well no I shove it down my throat sebastien up chucking the key in the net covering Sebastian with mud why did I even hey we did it do you want it sure cool you really want to go in this room well at least we have the key for it uh what was your name my name is slurp slurp I also have this list of ingredients that I'm looking for are they here I can't read I read out the list to them I don't know what those are alright there's a bunch of stuff in that other room - oh let's go in there what about your other friend this other dust friend is he is he as trained as you he's mean he makes fun of me and says I'm fat just round and globular maybe not fat though around as a shape so you're staying in shape like that just remember what should because we don't want to have to hurt him but we will actually we kind of want to hurt him can you give us a reason not to no okay that's I mean we were summoned here together he was kind of a he was kind of a jerk to me those those dust air maybe fits they just think they're so high and mighty over us our earthy types you know I first I went a little more down earth but you know you killed them so oh wow that's heavy here I gotta carry about um what's his name slurp slurp slurp I'll carry that for the rest of my life just know that but I'm gonna kill this me this thing over here and you're going to be back that that was a good me fit there his name was sucker ya know what the other mud one slurry is a bit of a sucker isn't he yeah he was I used to steal gems from him don't tell him I would tell them about ya umm slurp you get the honor of serving us for the rest of your life do you accept the honor I mean I've lived a long time how long are you gonna live probably not as long I accept yes slurp thank you let's kill this other one okay slurp you have this is how you prove your worth like a pointed stick down like he goes over to the cabinet and gets out a dustpan and sweep solid slurp you already proven yourself so useful he's gonna get you should get like promoted or something yeah he's definitely gonna be a head head head so you are now head slurp I don't know what that means but it sounds nice I'm gonna start looking around the room for anything that's on my shopping list yeah you managed to find a few of the things that are on the shopping list in here search searching around you're able to find some bits of snakeskin some eye of Newt some leg of frog you know a few of those things in there as well the also going around through the the things in here you managed to find a couple intact potions that survived the explosion or kind of potion okay you can identify them during a short rest do you want to take a short rest yeah sure food wood meats it a little bit I know why cuz I'm in less than double digits in health is that why wait guys I try out a new thing that I discovered it probably isn't necessary right now but I want to try it out anyway what is it are we taking a short rest yeah alright I open up my mum's spell book to a page that has a picture of a little Hut and I start trying it takes me about 10 minutes but I managed to create a tiny Hut cool in the middle of the room I'm like well be magical sphere that protects you yeah during this time you are able to identify the potions one is a potion of invulnerability one is a potion of heroism and one is a potion of invisibility okay who wants what we each get one heroism well I'm already heroic and invulnerable so I don't know if I think you should get heroism or invulnerability invisibility heroism an invulnerability yeah because I think veil would do really good with invisibility yeah it could be gross how many advantages - what do you want what's heroism do the potion of heroism the potion of heroism after you drink it it has the following effects for one hour after drinking it when you drink it you gain 10 temporary hit points and then you are also under the effects of a blessed spell that could be hilarious I think that one is good for you that's right up my alley and I'm already heroic so that's like double Harry well taken vulnerability which just means I take half damage on a bunch of stuff well that's great what do you think is better for I think you'll make better use of the bless yeah like me or vo could take the blessed but I think I think if his ability would be really visibility's hilarious yeah you take heroism all taken vulnerability uses invisibility doesn't mean you're quiet so I mean even if you were visible clunking around they can hear me but they can't see it coming and we're taking a short rest correct yeah Chloe I'm gonna take some hit dice I'm gonna take like 30 hit dice take and so we're just chillin in this Hut yeah it's a it's a nice little Hut okay I don't know it's a little cabin in the woods okay healed some actually not we definitely didn't eat this little magical Hut but I'm glad we have it is so fun just think of the possibilities so much decor so it's the hut just like a clear I know it's it's translucent from the inside but opaque and whatever color you want it to be from the inside yellow purple okay it's my Hut can we put like yellow on the edges around the door yes yes okay all righty which way will you go next let's go see this stuff yes so there's a hole in that one door yeah and then there's a lock door yep slurp the holy door you go through the holy door right have you been through the holy door slurp oh yeah there's a bunch of cool stuff in there that's where all the storeroom was and we're Madi Marco used to make all of this stuff but then the actual garden was through the locked door okay let's grab some stuff first and let's save that locked door the whole thing yeah we don't need we have to worry too much we can always go in later yeah let's go scrounge up some material slurps lead the way alright he waddles through leaving a trail of mud behind it and you're going through which Dorian the holy door I believe first holy beyond is a large extended workshop and what you can see here are the footprints of muddy footprints burn marks and scorch marks all in the tables and it looks looks like basically this workshop room is like a bottling plant where there's several tables that are laid out with that's small vats enough that the cauldron could be emptied in them and then tap on them and potion bottles and slurp says man Americo used to make a big batch of potions and we'd have to sit here and fill them all up where would you put them after we put them into the storerooms over there or he'd sell them off and then or that that store room month on the left there that had all the finished ones and that's got all the ingredients in all of man and Markos treasure and slurp where did Manny Marco keep the recipes well he would have kept the rest is he had a lot of his own recipes and his books and stuff upstairs okay upstairs doesn't look too well these days are any of these you might have a few with as treasures I don't know are they traps are there traps in these door can you just go in and out as you see well the doors used to have traps on them but that was back when there were 12 of us make sense where did the other ones go he points like a mud slick on the ground by one of the doors and achar twelve yes dear Count II yeah we got bored here after a couple years and wanted to try to get his treasure get some of the gems that he had in there but then we blew up by touching the door yeah is it safe now don't try to meet and it I don't know no one's tried since we didn't want to blow up let's let's flip over one of these tables mage hand together and see if we can open up one of these doors as you go to flip the table I first stop you and I'm like is there anything good on this table if the whatever was in this VAT examining it and seeing like the the liquid inside what you real I was making income and investing are counted Channel Arcana 22 the liquid in these barrels and looking at the ingredients that you saw on the other room and the cauldron and all the other barrels in here manny marco was making counterfeit healing potions oh like they're not even they don't evil but they're not they don't work this isn't how you make a healing potion I just learned this Wow I just so so like essentially you know in the process of making a healing potion there's a point where the liquid is charged with magic and so a layman would notice that it was magical but it hasn't been but that's just like the solution that you would use as the basis for any other potion and the ingredients that he hasn't here are basically that catalyst that you would use for a potion with grape flavoring he's pulling the wool ones grape ones cherry and ones orange I can verify this by trying they're delicious I take Izzy and rather carbonated I take some and I'm just like I like right on them not healing potion but these well they taste great that probably is the central innovation here but they're not healing but they wouldn't do anything good for like thank goodness they're they're of dubious health value as well yeah okay great for these two somebody at some point I'm gonna write that down these were just kind of chillin on how many are there the the bear the barrels themselves there's there's probably enough to make several of these fake potions yeah and are their bottles around where we can bottle a few yeah how many do we bottle do you want to buy slurp while we're gonna figure out the door he has to get to work bottling like for me to labor no I hated bottling the worst part was having to clean them up afterwards because he gets mud all over the bottles three oh one of each flavor yeah okay unless you wanted to make more but I want to open this door I want to set up like a booth and be like 50 Cent's we're not selling fake healing potions yeah we're gonna we're gonna bring track and I'm out of debt no it's just delicious drinks we won't I need delicious drinks the taste delicious I help you with like infinite treasures or fizzy drinks 30 feet okay back it up I'm still getting my shield out 10 ready for explosion like slurp I'm a tan major you open the door with the Mei Chen and that pull pulls open you because you actually realize that the door is locked but you can use slurps key to try to open it and turning the key it opens the door but as the door turns with the mage hand there's like a bolt of lightning that shoots out through the key the door opens but had you been the one to turn that key it would not have been a pretty sight maintain good tragic and I press the tab you did all this a long time ago this is she's new to this the room is filled with several large trunks the collection of mana Marcos investments over the years many of the the trunks in here are not locked but you can break the locks off them but the few that actually are and inside the various crates in and other things within are several are a total in silver trade bars about a thousand gold pieces worth of silver trade bars and then another 250 gold pieces in coin like 400 each with 50 left over I took the extra last time so whoever wants the extra this time so 400 each yeah in another container are several take the extra put things in another thanks friends case there is a jewelry box made from the shell of a turtle and inside it are several pearls there are in total five pearls each worth about a hundred gold pieces as well oh my gosh are we rich this time this time I'll take one pearl to each two to one so they're worth how much each are 200 each are we gonna sell them or sell them yeah you would need to sell them I'll make note of them on because I have a couple things that we need to sell as well so five girls right and then beside the the turtle shell box at the turtle shell case there is another wooden box that is tied up with a bit of line as well it the box itself is quite small it's about maybe about 5 inches wide 2 inches tall and 5 4 inches wide long essentially it's got twining around it yeah tied up fingernail and I just open the twine inside is a deck of cards I'm proficient in playing cards just a deck do I sense anything different about these cards I pick them up when you pick the cards up and look through them the they aren't playing cards all of them have several parchment cards of which there are in total there are 29 cards they almost look like collectible cards because looking at them there are different creatures depicted on each one one of the cards has the picture of a cloud giant another of a red dragon another of a goblin another of a an ogre another of a nolle another of a kobold and other fantastic creatures like they're almost like collectible cards but nothing other than that special about them they are magical oh they're magical magical detect the magic yeah because when you turn them over the creature on the card moves like the card is animated yeah take those magic cards anything else in here that we find make a game out of this and yeah I mean but we don't have decks to play with that's the only problem can we share no okay [Music] anything else in the room when we're rummaging through that's all okay do I find any more of the supplies I'm looking this is treasure room but there's another room yeah the other room is filled with more supplies and stores more of a rote nature most of the containing boxes and boxes of empty glass vials and another crates of these finished fake potions there's about 300 of these fake potions don't think we can make this into a business I start piling them into the bag of holding yeah we're gonna have so many say we could totally like go to the thieves and as they're like watching their their rounds sell these drinks how many how many do i okay no as long as you want to keep looting them okay all 300 came up with an idea what if we dirty in like them wooden crates to keep the bottles from breaking what if we put like lace them with something mister potion man and we could put people to sleep or something with them or working sick so we could give them as like a gift and then when they're all like sick we just go in and like do our thing it's usually where I'm gonna take 10 of each flavor that's great it's a 30 yes I have 30 potions okay 33 30 flavored drinks yeah like what you can surmise Sebastian is it Sebastian is that because he wasn't actually putting any real like magic of value into these things he could mass-produce them and sell them to somebody that just didn't know any better yeah let's you can see that the key ingredient seems to be snake oil yeah let's definitely give them to Jupiter but then he'll market it and make a fortune you know it sound like a few teller we use them as gifts we can use them as cheap gifts yes for the commander for Christmas yeah we imagine selling a fake healing potion to someone and they try to use it in a desperate situation oh how great think of the ethical implications I'm just gonna market them as great tasting drinks no healing whatsoever just yummy soda like yums are we calling them sodium so we we spend a bit of time kind of rummaging through the room and I'm obviously still looking for any of the alchemical supplies that we came here for I do obviously stop to take a lot of these yeah yeah so DeYoung's so do i I am nervous but I think we need to look into like this last door was that what he said was the the garden yeah yeah and he said that there was some bad stuff in there and that's where we should go through though well I think well maybe no no slurp I say because there's a door in this room that leads into the turbine correct yeah I mean we don't have to go through the big - John Doerr slurp why is there two doors it's just the extra way in and why didn't you lock this door sorry I'm you know at loaded question moving on slowly live in that room so it's more like obvious well that door is much smaller and the thing can't get in in through the smaller door what's the thing we just called it the thing it was it was kind of like all the plants in there came to life and they try to eat us I mean we've seen that before yeah we dealt with that I've dealt with that the garden I didn't do well he's really angry yeah can I ask what's the word is the well lead I oh I am obsessed with the well have you ever been outside what's outside Oh God oh my Oh slurp Oh slim we're gonna show you a new world you're gonna live on at our sittings all the sky yeah I hate skies [Laughter] so this door is unlocked I go up to it and I kind of jiggle the handle yeah Oh as usual the handle you hear a voice from behind it goes free guys I have a plan was that her you oh yeah that's her I throw in a sodium what is she usually eat Oh sometimes she goes out and she she sends out she's she you know she finds a way I don't know we don't go in there very often anymore but she does what if we um what if we storm both doors like they oh if you went in the side door and I go through the front door so I made kind of like a distraction and I stay out here and I could even you could be invisible because of a certain potion okay I'll say it though I could be heroic for all we know it's like a flower in there and flowers have never caused us very many problems never had trouble with a flower in a garden ever picking flowers was the easiest assignment we've ever been on you guys were hypnotized by the flowers I don't remember it all worked out in yet I don't remember it going down like things all work out in the end if I take the key and I go through the front door there you go through the side door she can get maybe an ambush surprise sort of attack Sebastian do you want to come with me or him oh now now I have to pick favorites so me I'm gonna go with Pluto yeah let's put up the magic a little bit also too much I'm good at range I like to put Pluto in front of me yes I can always run away if I'm not I'm run back like right away I run back usually in combat I just keep crawling and it keeps working that's true all right okay so how we're gonna know when to open the doors together how about your crow stays with me okay and then can you talk to him at all or no I can telepathically communicate with it so you will call three times when it's time to open the doors indicator set yourselves up good plan oh then I also am gonna battle ready something I'm gonna reach into the bag o tricks and pull out not the bear the first of many things what a jackal jackal it's a jackal it's a jackal how many should I have so I just create an army yep another jackal two jackals there's three a day two jackals and a baboon do you want to go the other door only get aggro jackal and for obvious reasons the baboon is kind of in charge of the two Eckles he's kind of running the show we add those stats do we technically own a circus are we sorry sorry everyone we have a circus now I know it is Monty Martin's flying dungeon circus how do you how do you quickly add menagerie it's the word of the day okay so I will have you all roll for initiative 14 wah wah okay Bao's got fourteen four okay Sebastian's got four great great habits seventeen okay so you will open the doors and your I'm not tracking initiative separately for your summoned creatures you guys can just do it as you want to so Sebastian you're gonna be last then we're gonna have the veggies then veo and Pluto and then as you kick open the doors our friend will be the first to go so this is what you see oh wait you know what can I make an the door open try that trick a lot oh man oh man okay you open the door into a large overgrown algae filled pool it looks like for a minute for a long time underneath underground here was some sort of underground growing space that through this underground greenhouse it feels humid in the air like water has been collecting and all sorts of subterranean flora and fauna are growing in this watery algae filled brackish pool in the center and it smells like fungus in the room and what you can see in this room growing out of the center is this massive conglomeration of vines and fungus that comes up in into this long neck and ends in a giant mouth and surrounding it are small plants that are picking the fungus and pot and taking them out into a hole in the room and these are various plants some of the alchemical plants that you've been sent here to retrieve that our ambulatory and carrying little Spears and gardening tools as they are and there's all gardening tools and niches all along along the room here as they are harvesting the plants in here and bringing them out into this hole that's been broken into the wall that leads into a rough set of burrows tunnels and as you turn turn around the just a mouth like creature looks at you and this weird plant like tongue comes out of the mouth and it says mom dinnertime what will you do that Audrey yeah oh no okay just so that we know for time we might go a little bit over is that okay yeah yeah okay all righty so Audrey catches sight of all of you and seeing all of this seeing you open the door her long vine light tongue extends out and it splits up into several different sections as it does so roping around the rooms to reach out to you all like tendrils and it makes an attack against each of you getting a 24 against pollute oh oh 13 against Sebastian and a 17 against Vale yeah that's shield okay it gets me you all of you that have been hit are grappled and restrained you have disadvantage on strength checks and saving throws Wow and then the tongue recoils backwards knowing you along 25 feet into the room get him jackals get him oh and one of the Jackals gets tendrils as well well I hit one of the Jackals to buy jackal this isn't good and then and then pollute oohs you were pulled up to her she lunges forward to bite you excuse you getting a 20 to hit that hits all righty and that will hit 420 piercing oh gosh oh man concerning this stroking your be coming at me and I'm like I'd like to stop it I'm just like your friends are I'm just sitting there stroking my balloon oh it's your turn oh my gosh okay um let's roll with it let's see what we can do okay so I'm grappled and restrained I've disadvantaged on strength checks my move is zero right do I get disadvantaged on attack rolls against it yes cuz you're restrained mmm she's interesting she's a wily creature conjuring the jackals Lee did nothing I guess I'm gonna just try to stab it with my okay my javelin here and that's not great os even worse at 11:00 as you go to stab her the vines that make up her body are like ayran No okay I'm just gonna do it again swing again swinging for them oh yeah I chritmas okay and then out of my bonus action get him jackal baboon and so the baboon comes in riding the jackal and and he's gonna it's gonna go for the vines holding me can I get it to attack the box yes yeah I do that jackal and baboon start to grab at the vines and try to free me okay go for it oh yeah so the baboon gets like a [Music] what's happening a 19-2 hit that hit 4 3 3 damage so it grows 1 damage it tries to pull the tendril apart but it can't it's just not strong enough and and and the hyena also oh and they get advantage because they all have pac tactics oh and just to see if the other guy hits no it wasn't a so uh and then a 5 to hit no no so the the Jackals trying to bite it and the baboons trying to free it help me help me creatures of the bag help me my forest friends quick a giant weird thing grabbed me that's my turn it is your turn you're the the tendrils are probably new clothes you are restrained what will you do I'm gonna try to get out of this because that's what I tried to do every time ok disadvantage Christ yes you you you you're in a grapple yeah so you can use acrobatics or athletics to escape acrobatics yes ok but disadvantage you said you only a disadvantage if you're using string using acrobatics all right ok 15 that is enough you managed to slip out of a breeze tongue like tendrils your fries and I use my feline agility to move how many feet away can I get i'ma go all the way around the corner by Van I'll be back and you know what actually how many feet can I make it around to the other room fine how far can you go baby yeah and if you do a cutting action - is that with cutting action - oh I could do - is my bonus X to me yeah yep so you're gonna go all the way around to Sebastian behind Sebastian actually a bit further out bit further back actually even further behind the corner cuz I don't want to hit any of those tentacles again yeah okay I you just vanished and I'm like where did fail Oh Oh even magic the veggies the veggies leap into the air and they'd all swarm the Jackals the bathroom so two of them go to attack then two to basically on everybody in the room so the veggie pygmies they get to against the first jackal getting a 9 and a 10 both men get the next one against the next jackal gets a14 and a-15 those are both hits doing three hit points yeah it the two of them together deal ten points of damage oh so they stab the jackal to death and then they start dragging its corpse back to words Audrey and then the baboon gets stabbed for a fourteen and a nine oh yeah 14 hits for eight damage that's it has three hit points my friends my friends and then Pluto to attack you with advantage one getting 23 and the other getting sixteen okay 23 hits for seven points of damage stats you and then the other veggies start picking up the corpses of your forest friends and bringing them towards Audrey so where all the veggies are they like actually dragging like them so they've used other actions I'm so sorry my forest friends my people Sebastian it's your turn I'm still looking into the room seeing these veggie pygmies like piling up on Pluto and I'm trying to like I'm trying to time it right go with you I'm gonna try to cut don't worry about me through and around Pluto with a wall of fire so I I'm like lining it up in the room and I and I'm start raising my hand up and out of the ground these fires start to shoot and this is this is what it's going to do I'm so much fire ski boys your armors or do heat up against or so close I get to choose which direction is hottest and like the other side of it is oh yeah so you're gonna do a circle around and if you can cut the tendrils with fire yeah yeah this could be huge yeah am I protect is this safety is this safety and like don't worry Pluto I got you covered and I like rise this ring of fire around you that just burns all of the veggie pygmies that are surrounding you and that is the coolest make saving throws now for them or is that at the start of their turn wall of fire when the wall appears each creature within its area must make a dexterity saving throat okay so I'm gonna roll for all the the veggie Pig knees so Wow you might not a single veggie pick me makes it so you just save Ludo Jackson and what about Audrey and Audrey she gets a natural 20 she says so she'll take half damage from them what about her tendrils do they do I'm gonna say the tendrils are destroyed nice yep oh my that's a lot 26:34 damage all the veggies are annihilated yeah three is lightly roasted really you do need to burn some of the plant matter that you're gonna be harvesting so this might not be too disastrous what you've done to the garden roasted veggies keep it contained yeah it might impair the supply that you have but you'll be able to get some going forward oh good okay because it is water right as well that the fungus is growing out of so the fire won't spread you're there yeah that's kind of yeah I want to keep it contained okay just murder the things that are murdering my okay so with that we go to the top of the round with Audrey who is shocked and appalled that what has just happened and she kind of shambles backward and she fires like tendrils out into the fire but but it's like raw oh I wanted my where's my dinner I don't want any roasted meat I want it raw and the tendrils fire towards it but it's blocking both the doorway and and pollute oh so she can't effectively attack with the tendrils like she sends them through but they get burned out by the fire immediately I don't know what you're gonna do on your turn that was so cool no it is your turn what do you know is the coolest thing the firewall is on the water right yep I dive under the water and I Huck my javelin at Audrey does this will it yeah will it blend the water is only like a foot deep but it's enough that you could get under the wall of fire and and I'm gonna use my javelin of lightning and I'm gonna hit her with a is there room for you to stand out of you're gonna use the lightning on the javelin lightning okay so I'm gonna dunk duck under the the firewall yeah you're gonna have to come out on the and I'm gonna do one of those cool like my action hero javelin I'm gonna send you for three points of fire damage I accept the singeing but I'm pretty on fire already singed whiskers and then yeah and in future runs because the heat is radiating outward in you will take damage from the radiation of the heat in future if I stay if you stay rated wanted feet 20 feet I think it's 20 or 10 i with ten feet of that side okay and so again I'm gonna come out and throw the javelin and then just keep running at her okay so 22 to hit that's a hit nice she's gonna take good that wasn't good that was pretty weak 1100 as she has to make know she just takes that plus 11 so 22 damage 11 of it lightning 11 over 80 javelin and then I'm gonna go get my javelin okay and I'm gonna keep going at her nice and then I'm gonna pull the javelin out and stab her with it Oh precision strike I getting a 17 it bounces off yeah it comes out as the sword comes down a small vine comes up from her side and just whips it out of the way and then my bonus action I'm gonna try to push her down underwater okay cuz I'm super strong alright her prone yeah for a tool she's got to be 224 you send her sprawling and she's knocked prone there though you're up down can I shoot through the wall of fire no you can't see through it to shoot right and because you don't have magical arrows any arrows that pass through it would be damaged by it and destroyed I actually have two magical arrows but if you can't see through it I might not have helped by knocking her from what I want to do can I get around the walls enough space there okay I mean yeah as long as you don't end your turn within 10 feet of it is that yeah that's the deal right I'll - is a bonus action using my cutting action okay out and around corner and I want to ready in action so that way if Audrey Audrey Wright gets up that I take a shot at okay cool so it'll be just one shot bill yeah okay sounds good next up is the veg of the veggies who are all destroyed Sebastian you're up we're gonna stop concentrating on this wall of fire okay [Laughter] that was its surplus yes so good so much now what are you gonna do and I am going to oh boy I'm just gonna send smoke and steam rises as several of the several of the plants have been destroyed in here but much of it still survived many do survive they've been burned but the the wall of fire wasn't in place long enough to like totally destroy the garden micro flies in and starts pecking at the knockdown ok odd to help you to help me which negates my disadvantage that I would have yep so I'm going to just fire bolts Audrey sure do you do 27 that's a hit I'm gonna use empowered spell because both of those were very low there we go nice 14 damage nice that leaves Audrey chlorophyll I love your exploration of all the different terms yeah losing like an aloe plant with that we go to the top of the round with Audrey who gets up from prone hi sure yep 15 as she gets up you fire the shot she bats it out of the way with one of her tendrils and sends the tendrils all out all around to all of you once again getting a twenty four versus Sebastian a14 versus veo and a.22 versus pollute oh do I also get do I get a sentinel because she's attacking someone yes cuz this is technically a melee attack yeah uh well I get I'll do it after okay and then and then hit me yep and then it also she doesn't real in grim who manages but Sebastian you get reeled in she didn't get me she didn't get you oh I'm being pulled towards it oh my god and she you as you get pulled towards it she bites down on you Sebastian getting an 18-2 hit and that is gonna be why it has very sharp ones at that that is gonna be a grand total of 22 points out piercing damage for me yeah and both you and Pluto are restrained and grappled and would my reaction go off before after their restraint before yes stabby stabby uh oh my god I believe 21 to hit for Ida precision that is a hit yeah for eight damage okay top of the round with Pluto it's your turn restrained again handles I'm gonna try to get out of it okay using your action yep okay I get a twenty uh twenty I you do have to roll disadvantaged if you're rolling out yeah because the root end rules do give you displeased over twelve yeah twenty-one so you do break out you scope out and then I'm gonna action surge and just start whaling on her nice and that's my battle cry oh my gosh the struggle is real uh 14 not enough no 17 again oh my gosh she slams it out of the way the fines are like a point defense she's using to protect herself I know I'm screaming on the inside anything else Pluto you managed to break out your action surge but you the attacks don't land it see I'm an enrolled a 4 and a 3 was brutal ok I just have to stand there yeah I don't want a knocker prone I'm gonna hit up Zephyr strike as my bonus action and I'm gonna move 60 feet out and it Vail and forgive me as far back as I can go get my advantage on my first shot 23 that is a hit adds that extra 35 damage there we go as you retreat out of the room and level your longboat you see the critical artery in Audrey's neck one vine that connects all the others and you shoot it right through and it snaps like a twig and she drops like a pile of vines and I catch Sebastian with in Audrey's body looking around through here with in Audrey's bodies and and beyond you can see that the broken cave adjacent to you is a burrow that leads to the shaft of the well and you can see there's a spot there's vines that are sought like intangibly growing up it that I get that you can surmise the vegie pygmies we're going up to collect food for Audrey down here below I'm so glad we didn't come in the well yeah I was gonna say if we're coming down the well it would have been so much worse we would have no hey what's in here yeah you find amongst here like there are ruins there's clearly audrey has been eating people because there's like digested bits of bone and mocking everything and within the rest of this you are able to find the rest of the plants and materials many of them have been singed but be but Audrey herself is composed of almost everything of so many of the things that you need I slowly squish Audrey into my bag of rye yeah well each grab a corner well guys I didn't expect to fight a giant plant monster today but it only bit me most of me yeah you're missing a good chunk yeah there's a chunk God I believe a lot yeah you can magic that back right no no my most of me what what about like assorted adventurer equipment that is undigestible by plant yeah looking around are several little bits of trinkets you managed to see that there is a small cloth doll that's been skewered with needles in the remnants of a backpack several teeth from some unknown beasts a pretty fine looking arcane focus type wand as well as a few multicolored brass orbs and marbles in a bag together beyond beyond the rest of this the the only other thing that you find buried beneath all the others is a ayran rod that has a button on the handle oh can I press the button can i press the button wait I'll use my mage hand to press the button go for it okay I stand back thirty feet press the button with him a champ nothing happens oh I go up to it I'm taking in my hand and I press it doesn't move it's stuck there oh you press the button and it releases I have it I don't know I've heard of it before I've read about it in books nerd I press the button again I said we the present there it just stays there like when you press and let go of it it's just the the iron rod just floats in space after you press the button what is this it seems like some sort of a movable rod when the buttons pushed I can't move it making it a moveable I'm gonna give this one out well I try to figure it out what about the creepy fudou doll is that just it's a creepy-looking voodoo doll but it is not magical yeah we should leave button in the plant matter throw it back in if I wanted to dress it up like somebody and stick pins in it oh you can still do that I guess I don't want it no I'm good with my I get this one that isn't as cool as my wand now I have to now you can do dual casting wands akimbo wow we're anything else you would like to do can't believe we survived uh we should go rest maybe in the are either in the tower we go back I can make a little Hut for us to rest in no don't use your magic Jude will just doesn't Oh No we could also on that's a ritual it stays up long enough room yeah oh no it's wrong rest down we could hide in here yeah I can put up the tiny Hut and nobody nobody will bother us down here it it is safe enough from the haze down here that you could rest we have another sanctuary now is it also safe to say like with all the the materials down here this could also be like a lab yes well-appointed it's it's secure slurps he's cowering in a corner slurp we killed I can't believe it that's amazing yeah that's why you work for us now okay you're gonna be I could stay here and protect this place for you head of potions yes protect this place produce I really don't want to go outside the sky sounds really scary yes there's also rain - you wouldn't like aa wet I mean I'm mud so I kind of like being wet but I hate don't want to be too much water water and Earth good quality between each you know your balance how about we can you use mold earth to block the well entrance yep I I start to I take some time to cast mold earth in my flock off the well what's your next move after this yeah so after our long rest I assume we're gonna head back to the commander we're gonna brew some of those potions and then I think we're getting ready for taking on the Lord of the feast because yeah that that and finding the heirs the mage tower yeah I think the Lord of the feast is the most pressing matter because the Noles are still passing against him yeah we need a deal with that so we need to get to the grid girl you are able to concoct up several doses of this stuff that surmising from oscar yarns notes and a few more days of work you'll be able to brew this continually it's gonna have to be you that makes it Sebastian working together it's possible to make a couple doses a day but it will require regular work from you and you'll probably have to be you'll probably in a few weeks you'll be on being a similar position with materials once again because well there's lots of elder you be able to find Eldridge lilies and delirium looking at this together and looking even through the remnants of Oscar yarns notes Queen Lenore is gonna be dependent on this guy's we're on borrowed time with green Lenore so we need to we need to fast-track this we need to find a replacement that involves getting into the castle in order to get into the castle we need the badge badges badges but first we want to make sure that we finished the job that we started with temple gate I think the Queen as much as we're keeping her alive we have a mission from her and I think if we can accomplish that mission she'd be happy to go but we need to figure that out first we need to have that replacement for the throne before we can let the Queen go peacefully and until then I think we need to make enough supplies to keep her going at least again for a couple weeks until we can figure it out and I know like I rumors are that the mages tower has a badge in it mm-hmm it also has some answers that I'm looking for about my mother so that seems like a likely place to check out however I know that you want to get to the cathedral and that should be our next where most of the way there we have made a huge impact against the Noles and I think we could convince the hooded lanterns and the silver order to push further I also think that there might be a badging in the cathedral as well because there was the high flame keeper that stayed there and had one so or two badges maybe potentially because we know there's the Lord Commander has one the queen of seas has one Saint Selina's might have one at the Cathedral the mage tower and the Grand guild hall are some of the areas that the Queen told us about it sounds like we have our work cut out for us and where we are now on a time crunch before the Queen decides when I'm useful anymore know before this is not useful I think which Queen yeah too many Queens know that Queen will take care yeah well deal with okay well back to make supplies indeed and that's where we'll end for the night thank you so much for joining us my name is Monte Martin I've been joined by our very good friends Kelly Jill and Joe playing Sebastian Pluto and veo respectively of course I am off traveling for the rest of June so dungeons of dragon time will be on a bit of a break until we come back on July 9th for more of the ongoing series as we find out what happens in the Cathedral the Academy tower and how our heroes will negotiate the various factions of Dragon I'm looking very much forward to it I'm glad I got a couple weeks to travel and get prepared because I this is all coming to a head I'm really

DMing and then we'll turn that around on the 18th where Kelly Joe and Joe will all be here together to answer questions as players in Drakon hime so again questions about building characters or about the characters in Drakon hime you can ask them then then as well but then after that Hallie's got some exciting plans on the 25th I'm going to be running a one-shot monster of the week if you're unfamiliar with monster of the week it is a 2d six system where it's kind of based on the idea of horror movies and TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and things like that where every week the characters have to face off against a new horrible monster so I've written out a fun little one-shot and we're gonna be seeing some new interesting characters we're being joined by a friend of ours named itch and he's gonna be joining us and we're gonna be doing some horror movie style role-playing it's gonna be so fun and that's happening on the 25th same time that we usually run so it's gonna be from 6 to 9 o'clock eastern time right here on Twitch and we're gonna see how that goes and that's something that I'm very excited about and if it turns out awesome I'm gonna see if maybe I can pop in for some more of those down the road and so hopefully you'll all join us there to watch me try to run an awesome horror campaign yeah and then we'll probably be taking the week of July 2nd off
