bastion of civilization on the edges of the ruined city there Our Heroes paid a visit to Sebastian's longtime mentor eldritch rune Weaver and caught up with River and Sebastian's family who were all staying together in The Little Crow house after a little bit of catching up sebastian has now followed up on several revelations the fact that his mother lana 'the Eventide was an Archmage of the amethyst academy Lenna 'the did not ever tell Sebastian's father about her identity as a powerful mage and so sebastian veo and pluto resolved to visit the old crow house where sebastian was born in search of some answers the house has been abandoned since Sebastian's birth and searching through the home beset with visions of strange shadowy hounds and otherworldly figures our three heroes found a cloak a pair of glasses and an amulet that had been buried in an empty grave behind the house putting on these three articles of clothing they were able to step through a magical mirror that belonged to len a--the in her life in the master bedroom into a strange sanctum of some kind in a dark and shadowy realm with halls of obsidian beset by shadowy creatures and tracked by an invisible Hound of darkness our heroes have explored the halls of Lennon's eldritch eldritch sanctum finding an inert clone of Lenna 'the Eventide but more so a active version or an active well who's to say tray tracking wet footprints through the halls of the sanctum our three heroes came upon a icy cold chamber overlooking the a large bay window overlooking the darkness of this shadowy realm wherein there was a large metallic sphere that they opened up to find Lana Eventide wearing a cloak she is a live elven woman of a rather regal bearing she has kind of a : aquiline features to her very sharp nose long pointed ears and raven black hair but her skin is a sallow gray white almost like it's sagging in strange places wrinkled almost in a very uneven like way there's something off about her complexion but she gazes at you with piercing cold eyes that are almost colder than the temperature of the chamber that you are in it's a small room as I said overlooking the darkness of the shadowy realm the walls and floors covered with a thick sheen of rime and ice the steps then building up to this metallic sphere that you opened up in which is a bed of snow where Lenin was inside the sphere itself when you opened it she looks at the three of you were guarding you with again these piercing this piercing cold look and she says what are you doing here this is my domain and you will leave now my name is Sebastian Crowe and I'm here to rescue you Pluto baya what do you say could we just close the orb and just kind of like go about our day mama carrot top it's nice to meet you we've been we've been looking for you she responds to veo what mama carrot top how dare you you insolent wretch hey don't talk to her like that she's my friend she will not address me by such vulgar terms I thought you were gonna be much nicer than this I'm not impressed you may leave peacefully now I'm very busy and this is my domain I don't know how you got past the Guardians outside but you are not welcome here do you even know who he is yeah Do You Know Who I am that you're addressing - just leave all I see are three strangers and intruders get out now I think you'd want to hear what he has to say I'm gonna fix my glasses and address ma'am this is your son as you push the glasses back on as you look at her through the the glasses you don't see a person of flesh and blood but rather an immaculate sculpture of ice and snow rather than the sagging kind of alabaster skin that she had before you see just this frost and like froat like it looked her skin looks like packed snow she's still wearing a cloak over top of it this brown kind of graying tattered bit of cloak but even her hair looks like it's made of strands of ice and it's not the same color cloak that Sebastian is wearing no that we found okay no Tobias Crowe do you know him if you are looking for somebody I think you've come to the wrong place this is are you an angel she smiles from a brief moment no I'm not why do you look like that you're an impostor obviously she [ __ ] her head looks back at you and says I've had enough of this wait show her the journals roll for initiative no we're gonna beat up your mom this isn't my mom this is not your mom this is one of your many moms you know I have perpetually more moms than I previously had so I can I can spare one I guess we have another one in the one of us in the living room and left the spare mom ready the mom more than one you bet definitely go - gotta finish this in mom's 2121 ten-four I'm distracted by your mom she's an angel he's a snow angel that she yelled at me she shot I like I like okay you know so first they uh you catch a glimpse of her reaching into her cloak and moving towards what looks like a magic wand and a glowing crystal orb as she steps forward out of the icy pod before you she's moving to act violently it's your turn and I'm like no and I take my bow and I aim towards the hand with the wand okay so I'm going to use my dread ambusher and I get my three attacks on my first turn mm-hmm eight it's uh aiming for her hand it sails right between her hand and her thigh singing through the cloak and it's tearing it slightly with it with a loud rip second shot thirteen it collides with her and as she does so she turns her hand and a shimmering shield appears in front of her and blocks the arrow last shot yet her oh no eight again the last shot is also deflected and in that moment I say well I don't want to be on the end of that one so I start to run out the door and around the corner but I don't want to go far because I still want to keep an eye out for my comrades so just right around that corner okay I can make it that's it okay it is letteth Stern she produces a crystalline snowball from underneath it's almost like a snow globe and as she pulls it out of her her cloak she drops it down on the ground in front of her and it cracks open and as it does so it a humanoid form emerges from inside it as you can hear the crackling of freezing ice and air and water as this massive ice sculpture forms into this hulking muscled creature which looms up right in front of you how are you and as it reaches up on top of it these big spikes start to grow out the top of its back that then crack open and break off into four small fluttering ice creatures has got so tense Oh maybe she did it by accident she dropped it right so I just need to make some additions to our initiative oh good Oh super that's what we wanted look when it comes to first impressions your mom is really losing me I'm like looking at you I'm like this is not my mom I'll introduce you to her so I can stab this with yes I think we're safe to say we're on stabbing terms okay good good okay so at the top then we have veil then Lenna then Sebastian then the big ice creature elemental then pollute Oh then the small little ones with that lana 'the draws her the the cloak up around her and she cries out destroy them okay Sebastian it is your turn you stand as this hulking creature of Elemental ice bears down upon you the air is freezing around it coalescing into more frozen bits and spikes as it raises up its fists that are just fists of icicles hmm all right Sebastian rolls up his sleeves says I don't know if this is gonna work on all of these things but it's time to give them the old razzle dazzle and I cast hypnotic pattern hypnotic pattern okay like that to target it can I get letteth the big guy and this dude yeah you can all right it's pretty big guy yeah it's a big one yeah a 30-foot hue okay 16 the method fails the earth elemental gets a 15 16 okay so the ice elemental failed she gets I mean that still gives me actually it's a 27 and then I'm like oh time to time to back up here Pluto it's all you okay the ice elemental hypnotised in place by the hypnotic pattern lowers its two arms down and just stares at the pattern Pluto you're up I I kind of like walk around it okay underneath one of its arms as if I was admiring like a sculpture like oh sorry and I stab a javelin okay let's you move around I go I really wanted to meet you I'm so excited but now I have to 22 that is a hit for nine damage and I'm gonna do to do sebastian veo as you see Pluto's weapon you're using your spear your so you see her as you stab into it it's not blood that comes out of her but bits of snow and ice that trickle down the spear that the spear she's a snow angel I knew it no demon no I have a irrational fear of snow people and I'm going to take it out on her it's part of my lord I knew a precision strike 4:22 again okay that is a hit and four eight damage okay anything else wait this precision attack get the thing with the more damage I don't believe it does yeah it's just to help yeah yeah so cool cool okay oh and then I'm gonna shove her on the ground okay Chevy Chevy shudder 21 yes she is still a feeble mage as mighty as she is she is not that strong so I got I'm your prince charming Snow White I start smashing her and as I'm stabbing her okay cuz I'm a gentleman sorry about your mother with the shield I'm sorry okay the methods here they come ice to see you they flutter through the air on wings of ice almost impossibly this glitter of dust following in their wake and as they do so they exhale a burst of of cold out in front of them and I need both of you Sebastien to dexterity saving throws you've got to make one there and is it against me is it directed at me or is it an AoE it's an AoE it's a cone of Frost 18 18 you make your saving throw but you still take five points of cold damage I will accept I get a 19 and an 10 so those both succeed you still do take 10 points of cold damage from the two attacks and I will need to concentration checks about the 27 and a11 succeed well done Daisy okay and we go to the top of the round with a veil all right I hear all this commotion and I peek my head back out some help and I cast zephyr strike and I take my two shots oh sorry I'm shooting the elemental right beside super yep are sorry that the me fits yeah 18 it hits 25 damage it talks like shattered glass and violently explodes into shrapnel no Sebastian you need to make a dexterity singer oh it's okay I'm really good at these okay 15 okay you take for slashing damage I'm fine I'm fine kill the other one that is another concentration check though oh yeah we're good okay I then take the other shot can I shoot passed it was a Sebastian yeah they're flying in the air around him so you can absolutely get the shot take my second shot against the other this can only go well it goes right into the method it pops like a light bulb and once again Sebastian now that one unfortunately also damages the ice elemental with the explosion shaking it out of the hypnotic pattern no and I needed a new another dexterity see ya 23 you're fine elemental does fail its dexterity saving through and it takes the full damage from the shard but it is now snapped out of the hypnotic pattern do I still need to make a concentration for this little method here if you so choose yes or you can dismiss this if you just want to fail if you don't care I Carolyn okay so uh sorry uh thirteen okay this fellow is still in effect right as well until I cast I have a different spell caster okay super so veil anything else okay stay where I am so we now go to Menace she grits her teeth as you bear down over her she grits her teeth and disappears from view uh no snow woman she's a demon hmm but not to you oh I can still see her yes because you're wearing the glasses so you just see this this shadowy out so she snaps her fingers and she's still still there yes my cool trick yep and she turns to she turns to run from you though you can make an attack of opportunity oh yeah baby 21:21 that is a hit nine damaged nice I go there's no way you're getting away from me she does succeed her concentration Jack I'm gonna make her feel one of these thank you okay stop her in place when you do that it does because you've sent no practical yeah didn't think that one through okay Sebastian we go to you so there's this big ice guy that just woke up in front of me mm-hmm in a panic Sebastian holds out his hand and just starts blasting fire beams at it okay housing scorching ray nice that's a ten the scorching ray is deflected off of its icy hide Oh No if I hear another one that's a little better thirteen it does not penetrate through the ice okay leaving just a small like crack on one of the shards of ice all right skull-splitter dice go I just have to announce it and then talk to it you got it yeah the dice I'm just gonna roll twice the amount of dice here for my crit and actually I'm gonna use empowered spell to re-roll three of those dice okay that's a good call there we go yes 13 damage all right fire the elemental shrugs of the hit although parts of it is buckled away the FRA and melted slightly it already freezes in place even though some of its mass has been broken off so we now go to the elemental who turns and basically it takes its arms out as wide as it can and it just spins just kind of like the top of its toilets the bottom part of it almost rotating in place and just spins like a top but this - mace like arms just slapping both of you in the back of the head so one on Sebastian and one oh I didn't I didn't move away did I I don't think I get a 22 against pollute oh and an 18 versus Sebastian solid hit okay both of you take 20 points of bludgeoning damage and you can just feel the ringing in your ear and you can hear the shattering of the icicles that have broken off the other side and as it completes the spin it just flexes and more spikes come out of the end of its fists I tried beating up planet Pluto you're up as I recover from my mild concussion I go into a flurry of stabbing snow lady okay why won't tell your thing to stop it sixteen that it it seems as your blade comes down there is a field of force protecting her she tricky yo eleven okay I got an action surge okay okay 25 25 that will go through the blow connects for ten damage okay again in place of blood from the connected blow just bits of ice no I need a little bit of gravel fly from her and then a 24 another solid hit for eight damage that leaves her bloodied and then if she can look that provisional I'm gonna just I'm just gonna I'm actually gonna use my second wind this time is because she's still down on the ground no she stood up okay on a previous turn yeah I'm gonna knock her down again okay I got seven wait I do it she gets a 13 how do i I'm just doing my supposed atlantic's I athletics 10 she stays up yeah darn it okay and she does make both of her concentration checks per minute I'm gonna get hit in the back of the head she is yes okay that was Pluto so the methods there is one me fit remaining that latches itself on to Pluto's back and claws at you Pluto getting a 15 against Tracy no good go back to the top then with Dale I see all this commotion happening and I want to aim at the big guy because I don't want my friends to get hit again so I'm gonna take my two shots I'm going to cast ever strike again second time mm-hmm that way I get that advantage so first shot 20 that is a hit against the big elemental 27 damage do you have a magical weapon no okay seems that it's magical Nature has blunted the damage don't use my magical arrows yeah can I tell can I tell this that is because he's magical you can you can see this that something it is a creature of magic I then decide on my second shot I have five magical arrows I want to use one okay see if I have 12 unfortunately the arrow sails past we'll go get it after we survive okay um missing that I duck back around the corner okay Lennis she grabs the corner of her cloak pulls it up around her and disappears a puff of smoke no and this time I just might last as she does so is she do you just hear hear the words you can freeze to death in there Bastien make a dexterity savings my one weakness 12 which side of the door you want to be on the inside the doors slams shut and quite suddenly a wall of ice appears in front of the doors there you can see this from the other side as well are we still in initiative you are indeed because this elementals still there oh it's still there yes I jump into the room see this freeze over and like holding all my wounds I turn to you flute oh and I'm just like I'm here for you but I can't find her I'm outside just like I was in a really intense position now I'm like what so she just pooped yep and the door slams shut and iced over she's so rude I don't I your mom yeah worst first impression maybe she's having a bad Sebastian it's your turn what are you gonna do I'm super not breast mmm I I don't see any way to get past this guy without him getting an opportunity attack right you're 5 feet away from him if I move around him am i close enough to grab Ludo without leaving his range you could move into his reach and stay in his reach well moving around him yes could I grab Pluto and thunder step yes you can can I understand outside of the room you can try I try okay which where are you gonna go okay I have to make Constitution saving throws for them which they fail you can roll the damage very nice move yeah yes you saved my life again well we'll see I'm gonna use empowered smell to reroll and all of those okay oh it's better twenty twenty damage okay make a charisma saving from twenty nine okay so as you lift the two of you together to teleport away you can almost feel the shadows of this realm trying to pull you apart as you move extra dimensionally but you're able to maintain your sense of being and thrust you and pollute Oh desperately out on the ground across from the other side of the door and then I collapse it's been a hard day how do they come in to the scene the way we didn't talking about Thunder step is that it's almost like you know that kind of sound right before a thunderstorm for a moment then it's like a BAM well they appear with like a BAM because it's the under step so they just show up and just kind of collapse forward right right beside you veil like that I'm kind of like scratching my head around not really knowing what to do and all of a sudden there's just like BAM beside veil and I'm just like anymore I like slowly get to my feet start brushing off all the ice pulling like icicles out of me and I'm like yeah we were we did good we did we did all right in there everybody good good work all around I want you to kill the snowman that's that's my mom so you know I'm like Queen Nora's around a so sure it was her I'm not sure at all I'm not sure that's your mom and if she is she's being kind doing I need like you have some right I need a healing bath do you have any don't worry about me are you okay yeah I'll be fine you guys want to go to the pub well we're back at your this is we kind of claimed this as your place now we all we I remember the last time we kind of assumed that this is now your place so this room is sort of off-limits for the time being we'll just put like an out-of-service is the door like locked it's frozen over from the other side she left she disappeared too if I have the glasses I looked on the hallways do I see her you look down the hallways I'm just gonna scan you back towards the set of doors and there are a fresh set of watery footprints and small chunks of snow going back down into the main foyer and up the stairs again I'm gonna tell these guys you guys want to follow those we got to move quickly I'm hunting a snow burden okay let's go I'm just gonna pull this health potion out and drink it what's a potion of greater healing give us uh 20 points back I get a drink one okay I am also going to drink one how many points sorry the greater ones are twenty all right and then let's let's keep up the pursuit okay so we're like running and chime motion I'm leading with the with the glasses so I'm doing like the potions coming like you know Gatorade spray bottles that we can just be running and be like oh oh no one of those camel packs where I have a little sip err that I can use as I hands-free for the fighter on the go well it's really bad on that action surge I rolled two fours brutal and then she shielded which uh okay yeah yeah I'm following the footprints go find the frosty popsicle we're coming after you okay she's no longer mama carrot top no ice mom she's cold-hearted mom you say she's cold as ice I'm willing to sacrifice [Laughter] [Music] okay we went there thanks okay so you're standing in the hallway you've escaped this frigid room what are you gonna do we're chasing the footprints pursuing rince footprints okay which way will you go there after the footprints okay so back up to the foyer to the to the main hall yep okay and is it still fresh as we go like is it still is a they are you did not skip a beat so you're you're moving quite quickly after start the the start at the end of the hallway so I didn't see her come out when she did she's still visible right I think so okay well yeah that makes sense yeah we need your glasses for seeing mm-hmm I got her you got it I'll follow me follow me Jackson 3 you'll eat you mean three crows are on the move okay you lead the way you lead the way dad dad did it's a dramatic running scene mm-hmm he's slowly falling behind I'm just kind of like jogging okay you rush up back the back to the hallway back to the foyer a and back up the stairs coming back up them to that large laboratory room where there were the two pillars converging in the glass sphere in the middle in which there is the clone of lettuce the laboratory equipment is all scattered about and it looks like someone has been rummaging through a bunch of the things in here trying to grab something to pick up a few things administer a few things and you can see like splashes of water and ice all over the stairs then the footprints then go it went upstairs before they go down this time we I go down sirs let's do it and I keep running that don't run on stairs it's dangerous and slippery yes everyone wet oh yes we continued the person okay okay you rush down the stairs this time coming to once again another cube-shaped chamber just like before as you come down the stairs they go down to a landing and then up and then again and again it's almost an identical size and shape these rooms that are approximately 60 feet wide and long and 60 feet high perfect cubes and the root this room however has been outfitted quite differently from some of the other ones that you've seen before let me just pull up my notes here really aesthetically pleasing house though like realm I like the just needs a coat of paint yeah they've been all the scary shadow monsters and ice we're gonna change the lighting aesthetic nice furnace in here [Music] a good place you need HVAC guy and just kind of get a quote get a good quote maybe hang some paintings on the wall its cadet pretty bleak in here okay so we went downstairs this time the only problem with making a four dimensional dungeon is that you forget the order everything isn't okay so we went up and then they went down again which means that you are in we're having the same we're like yeah it's like up and down but yeah we went up and down we're just as lost okay somebody draw a map mm-hmm I did draw a map so it just has like lines going nowhere and it's like just question marks everywhere I could follow that it's a work in progress so before you had passed through a library in the summoning chamber and now you come into a room that has been outfitted almost like a small barracks there are several about six beds in this room each of which has a awning or a kind of room divider or bookshelves separating them each from each other each of the the light in this room is quite a bit lower than everywhere else and it seems like the each of the individual sections of this room have been isolated off so that there's a little bit of privacy almost as if some people could come in here to study or stay as guests but the accoutrements are very Spartan otherwise and the footprints lead in here the the footprints cross the room and then go down the stairs on the opposite side we're barely taking time and there's another set of stairs three sets of stairs in this room one that got the ones that you came through another set that go up and another set that go down so I'm I'm kind of like more or less tracking the ground for the footprints than I am paying even really much it's okay to the surrounding I'm paying a little bit of attention and I turn to the other two I'm like are we keeping track of how to get back yeah okay good no it's like that it's I picture that painting with all the stairs we're just or like a scooby-doo thing where we're running through doors and we're just running back and forth along the same hallway so which just so we know which stairs are we following so he said there's three mm-hmm are they all going down or they all going up where they're going Jews came down the set of stairs yeah and then there's another set of stairs on the north wall going up and on the set and opposite you going down again so you're going across so you came down and now you're going down again we're going across the room and then yeah okay okay I like that yes goodbye Oh York you're a guide okay as as you come to the base of the staircase who's leading Pluto me clue you know one chance to make a perception check this is my forte I say confidently without even looking at my stats perception mm-hmm 15 15 okay oh and just kidding yes 15 because I'm exhausted still so oh my I see okay okay you hear as you come towards the top of the stairs you here for a split second someone uttering arcane words from from the bottom from the landing of the stairs so someone that you can't see you look down there the snow stops there's a large puddle and you can hear someone uttering some arcane words under their breath and I can't see you can't see but you can hear them I'm gonna do a power slide okay so I to go down the stairs I'm gonna do like a feet first slide down I don't even know if this is gonna work okay to try to it inherently dodge okay magical attack alrighty we'll keep the initiative order as before so we'll just say we're back from from your turn as you come down this these stairs oh and I'm gonna yell watch out you go watch out so you kind of hit the deck here at the bottom of the stairs you can hear these arcane words about to happen Vale what are you gonna do I stopped at the top of the stairs okay so there's a split moment where the lemon comes into view one more once again as she completes casting cone of cold and it fires this blast of cold goes up the stairs which Sebastian I I don't think I've had a chance to do anything yeah Sebastian how far back are you would you be then I'm I was probably in the back of the three of us okay she's at the top of the stairs I'm just past it so I need Constitution Constitution saving throws because the cone of cold blasts up the stairs I'm gonna give advantage on the saving throat to Pluto and Sebastian because Pluto you did the power slide underneath and Sebastian you're too so far back but viho you're basically catching the kona cold in your face constitution yes please twelve you said with advantage mhm 25:25 okay 23:23 twelve twelve okay mmm okay let's see here so I'm looking for I'm looking for a 21 oh what'd you get 25 25 23 okay so both of you succeed you're saving throws against the cone of cold nope Vale you do not know you're gonna be a gold giddy popsicle it's 40 points of cold damage and half for the two of you that made saving throws I'm gonna use shield master evasion and absorb it with my user my reaction and absorb it with my shield okay there goes that potion I took after taking a strain on your not only our muscle but our tank and our guide and our you are the team we're just right for the pain she as she finishes casting the spell she breathes deeply and scurries down the stairs do I get a shot at her your power sliding down the stairs just pulled the shield up I'm gonna say that because you were focusing on defenses you power slow it down you're not close enough to her to make the attack can I Huck a javelin at her on your turn absolutely yeah because I'm gonna do she continues to run down the stairs Sebastian it's your turn can I still see her she's gone down the stairs you'll have to run friend I run after her okay so I move 30 feet mm-hmm can I see her you can yeah and see her at the base of the stairs she's she's run down you can see that she's coming into another cube like like room but you can't quite see what the rest of the features of the room are I get to the bottom of the stairs and I just yell stay put and I cast web nice okay she gets a 8 the web like just sticks all around her okay putting her to the ground and she's just trapped there all righty Pluto we go over to you I recover from my power slide mm-hmm can I get to her yes you'd have to use double move to get all the way to her unless you want to if you want to get right up to her I will I'll - okay and so you come to the base of the stairs and find that you're back in the lab room your house is freaky man yeah yeah we'll have to find a map or a guide or something at some sort of like I know let's just do it an elevator would work in this place with snow mom I I want to get ahead of her like I want to get on the other side of the web she sure she's she's restrained in the web she's struggling against it but she is trapped in that and I'm gonna give her a command like stop okay top with bail so I'm a bit uh frostbitten on my face how many feet is it down the stairs I can see her in total from the top of the stairs to the next set of stairs from one room to the next 60 feet of movement is required No I am going to use my feeling agility okay which doubles my speed and I'm gonna book it down the stairs to where I can see her mm-hmm and I'm gonna take two shots at her all right you got advantage because she's restrained 13 even restrained in place the magical field of force protecting her shield her from the blow I'm gonna take a second shot a magical arrow okay nope sorry BAE oh I am NOT aiming true today okay it's okay okay you did just get like blast in the face with all this snow and ice I don't blame you I'm not holding it against you and I are like limping all over the place in she is we now go to Lana she's restrained in the webs and Sebastian you can see you see an expression on her face that you recognize as that frustrated expression but also like a look of horror the look of a mage who set a spell slots and as she struggles against the web she just fires a chill touch at pollute oh hi getting a 28 to hit oh wow she's so cool Pluto that's gonna be 17 points of necrotic damage do that reaction thing I'd be so down and you can't regain hip points tell this tell the end of her next turn I was being I was gonna like restrain her Sebastian Europe as a bonus action I'm going to use my last three sorcery points to gain back a second level spell slot I'm going to walk towards the web and I say you know what mom you're fired and I cast scorching ray okay Vantage on all the attacks 24 that hits I'm just gonna do all three and see all her fire she's in the way actually elven accuracy alright crit oh my god there it is and the third one twenty-seven that hits as well Wow so this is a crit and two hits curtain so eight d6 fire damage total yep 14 for the Chris eighteen more very well done the three scorching rays pierce right through her body melting away her flesh like snow and leaving behind that icy residue after snow has been melting for too long and as the flames ripped through the rest of the web's she melts leaving behind only the cloak her wand and a puddle of water I reached down and I pick up the wand this was a crappy reunion anyway put it in my pocket yeah not not not how I thought this was gonna go I don't even like hurt him he wanted to question her but I don't she she almost killed me she almost killed you she kind of hurt Pluto a little yeah emotionally I'm sure Pluto is having a rough time I am a little shaken and I hope this doesn't affect when I reach meet your real mom if she's still alive yeah I hope I hope this doesn't leave a bad taste of me I'm just wondering about what that clone is I mean we might have better luck with the clone that this this wasn't my mom if we open this other one and it's the same reaction imma be so mad me too I'm gonna be disappointed I'm not even yeah yeah I'm just disappointed at that point Sebastian you can make an Araucana check 22 okay what's just happened in what you saw in the other room you can very easily deduce given the capabilities of what you've seen around you this definitely wasn't your mother it was a simulacrum spell of her which might explain why it doesn't recognize you because simulacrum spells simulacrum can't regain their spells lots and they also can't form new experiences her memories so this simulacrum might have been created before you were even born seemingly before she met my father at all yeah because she didn't know to buy a Spencer does it and before manners were invented very like the same personality as its creator probably but existence is pain for a simulacra and if she's existed for if the simulacra existed for like 30 years it or even longer also given that it casts a few spells like it was tapped out anything cool about the wand the wand is a blackened wand with the expression of a howling face upon the end of it the wand is magical as is the cloak cool I pick up the cloak as well kind of bring it out as you as you wring it out the you can see that the cloak has been tattered and waterlogged but it would have been at one point this very fine almost velvet red cloak had it seems like age has really worn it down but it is magical in nature as is the wand if you take some time you'll be able to identify them cool I I put the cloak in my bag of holding for now and the wand he's in my pocket okay do wands get holsters I can I have a cool wand holster we'll work on that okay I'm feeling a little bit rundown um there's some beds up or down or maybe sideways yeah this is the thing it's like we're there we we just we just killed simulacra mutts wait simulacra mom simulacra there yep took the scenic route but we got there but I still feel like we don't have any answers like where are we why was this created what's going on so I I mean I'm a little spent here my magic energies are running pretty low I feel about three healthy if you had to put in like between between zero to 37 I'd say I'm about a three okay do you like we can just go have a nap in the guest room and take watches I mean also I mean if we go back out the mirror we know where this place is we can like go rest and then come back what about the ice elemental she's frozen in a fridge room okay you left him in the fridge yeah he'll be fine now that now that it's master is dead maybe it uh maybe it needs a new one but we're not going to test that yet I'm tired yeah okay what will you do what do you guys think what do you think my plan was to just go upstairs downstairs wherever to those beds and we can stay in here what time is it yeah this is a featureless realm of inky black darkness there is nothing to give you any sense of of time all right I think we should go check out we could also leave yeah well I'm just thinking that I don't there was a demon you know summoning spell upstairs it's randomly probably deep I don't know if I necessarily feel comfortable resting well that should we just go like can we go give it a quick peek I'm gonna go take a quick look like so one of those like around the around the corner of like the edge just to see if an all three of us like one two three just to take a quick look just to see if you all like peek around the corner and you see that the one room which is only outfitted as the summoning chamber just continues to flicker with as then the magic swells up with a large crackle and boom a demon appears and it just looks up like really confused for about three seconds before disappearing again although but you start to realize is happening after like just watching it for about a minute is it seems to be doing this to not an infinite number of demons but about the same five or six demons and then once in a while as you watch it go by the the demon its cycles through a few a few new ones but it seems to be like there's this particular demon that looks like he's got an insectoid head and he's all covered with like an icy Sheen there's got a pitchfork and he's just like prepared for things that when he appears he charges towards you and that disappears again and is he always reset back to the middle of this this is my entertainment room I'm gonna like set up a chair and just like sit here and like wave at the demon yeah at some point they're gonna break out and that's gonna be the worst but for now now that's future Sebastian to deal with so I don't know what else is here other than those demons and I don't feel safe just in case they get out I don't want to be rampaged by a demon in my sleep there but I also don't necessary want to stay in your creepy old house no no I was thinking like we could literally go back to the new crow house go to bed yeah come back in the morning that sounds good ask your dad yeah we maybe maybe we can like inquire and be like yes so here's a wand here's a cloak we killed fake mom we fought some demons there's a whole world behind that mirror what up what we need to go ask yeah you have to end this other clone room is it is it with my expert knowledge of how magic works does it look inactive active is it the apparatus is thrumming with power but it seems to be in a holding pattern because we should maybe wait to open that one but maybe we can open it and be like where your master clone mom might be much nicer than simulacra mm-hmm that's true you can have a real mom I mean that's what I'm hoping for now is and you know like play with there we could be a real film and there's no Sun unfortunately in Dragon time so yeah it's super sad yeah still okay so you'll beat a retreat and head back to amber wood village but we I want to make sure we grab the stuff off the statue before we leave yeah and I have my glasses on so you you take the the the amulet the cloak and the glasses and leave the room okay okay the weird pocket dimension as you leave and step out of the mirror and back into the real world sensibly you probably spent the better part of an hour - in that world but as you step back out outside it's uh if look back up over to this where the Sun is because you can still kind of tell it sounds like Drac and I'm proper the Sun doesn't come out but the day looking around because you came in here around the mid afternoon and Everwood Village tends to pick up by the afternoon it seems like nearly any time has passed at all I mean that's a good thing that means that us leaving resting and going back in every time we're in there it's just lost two hours of my life or don't still I feel two hours older oh god I have so many questions no but if I stay in there do do I age we need to do experiments guys I have another idea yeah what if we just took the mirror breaks the magic I don't know how that works either why I'm just a bit I don't want to be able to get back into fine clone carrot-top mama I'm worried about breaking it but I wonder if we just put it in the bag of holding and we have like us anything can fit in there you got it just measure him it just yeah it's it's like a moving truck you know you just got to organize it properly yeah but like maybe moving the mirror to a safer location is safer for though it's a safer for everyone well well it being in an abandoned house that kids break into to like I don't know it's like protected in its secrecy a little bit because no one really knows so that has that there's the up there I mean it's been here for how many years and it's fine and they also need the things right I think they need to be real careful about Howie I just wanted to throw it out not as a as they do it now but it's maybe something too we can sleep on that we're good eventually they take the mirror if we needed to inch or try it yeah if we understand it more definitely I would say like let's sleep on it and then come back and make decisions after week was it covers when we got here no it wasn't maybe just put like a blanket over it yep we don't want anybody seeing themselves dead in the mirror yeah it's okay I'm shocking so you're gonna cover the mirror leaf yep okay you head back through the village and return to the small crow house the little crow house and the big old crow house little new crow house big old crow house did you come back in you find that Moira is still there tending about things she's with your sisters your brother and your father Sebastian have gone off to work at the smithy Eldrick and River are nowhere to be seen the cart is still parked at the front but beyond that the Moira greets you and she's your back soon we had a few chilling encounters Oh we needed a need it just to recuperate you all look terrible are you hurt yes a little bit I like open up the cloak and it's just like icicle shards sticking out of me and there's like blood and she she she was o-town she's looks like you've all got frostbite and she she starts barking orders to your sisters saying go and go and fetch some hot water and a few extra blankets you have any tea she says to your older sister get a kettle boiling and says what happened you went to your old house no sir it's not the most pleasant place I've ever been well take a rest will tend to you I'm not sure when L drink and River said they would be back but they said they had some business to tend to hopefully they'll be back soon and they can help you or something but in the meantime you sit right down you just still get you some tea and we'll see to that frostbite yes thank you okay it's warm out yeah and I just take some of my salmon that river just given me and I just like start eating it I need some comfort food here because I'm just like just like sitting by the fireplace with a blanket over my shoulders just sipping my tea super so do you all didn't tend to take a short rest or a long rest if we from a time perspective if we do a short rest we could go back yeah but then we would be doing it at night I also a long rest puts us further back I don't but it is sing slots upon a short rest you know I'm virtually useless unless I take a lot so then I think when you no longer okay okay yeah cuz it's like mid-afternoon it was a rough go I think yeah I think this is more than an hour of healing I think this like requires a nap before we delve into the ruins again a big thank you to accident shield for providing us with the awesome gaming accessories

before the break we our heroes had left the mirror dimension and had returned to ember wood village where moira and the little crows had tended to their frost burn after their encounter with letteth s-- leftover simulacra or the simulacra simulacrum um that's hard to say yeah yeah I'm glad she's dead now so spending the time to rest up the afternoon and into the evening past rather uneventful E with T and some snacks from Moira and some light chatter from the children do you tell Moira or your siblings what you've encountered so far no no I quietly and subtly hint that she's the better mom by constantly thanking her like just to make it known that she's the better version of being like you're such a good mom to Sebastian yeah she smiles and she says well that's what family is all about taking care of each other understanding each other really listening to each other not jumping to conclusions or assuming the worst in people but seeing the good in everybody and then I'll like look at her through the glasses to make sure she's not a snow person at night I've always just kind of checking the first time that you met me you were you were immediately kind to me and I'm glad that you didn't like blast me in the face with snow or ice it was really kind of you really happy you know the true mama carrot top we appreciate everything you do for us she smiles and said well who would I be to leave you out in the cold [Laughter] Emma and civil try to ask ask questions of like did you see the creepy ghost in the house yes yeah and what happened it was scary there was a dog it ate me in my dreams and almost in reality you tell this to your sister yes they just stare why don't you men like that's so cool never doing that yeah never going that ever ever go in that house you know tell everyone that my brother fought the ghost of the haunted house and he killed that ghost and he is a hero you can't kill a ghost they're already dead oh let me tell you as the evening passes tobias comes home with peter and he sees you up and down he says he went into the house yeah what happened in there whatever you saw I don't want to know about it it's part of my life that's gone I think we can get answers from Eldrick and River more so than from my dad my dad didn't even know about this whole side of you know about the beer no I mean he knew that there was a mirror he stops and he says he found what are you doing with my dead wife's glasses oh you you said you didn't want to know she just she just always wore those glasses just I thought she looked he sighs and he says they're nothing but relics of the past you can keep oh thank you they're for hunting snow angels he gives you a very confused luck I think it's time for us to leave yeah I think we well we dressed it up we've gotten fed well warmed my nose isn't so cold anymore well dad if you ever do want to hear about what went on in that old house I'm sure there'll be stories of the incidents that occurred there it was years before people stopped talking about the night you were born oh I know I remember the stories I don't remember being boring that's ridiculous but take care yourself are you leaving town now or we actually might pop no just we're gonna go wash mousse we we did find something in the house I know you don't want to know about it but does require further investigation but we did want to come back here just to just to have some tea and rest up and I'm all over the things that we had found but there's still a little bit more research that needs to be done but it actually is very important and could be very helpful for our adventures in dragon hunt so I apologize that we're going digging through the past but it has proven fruitful for us and I'll try to let the past stay in the past but I won't bother you with what we've discovered I'm going to make a wand gesture to you we're not going to talk about okay okay after completing your rest the items that you've found going over the the few items that you have recovered taking the time the cloak and the the first cloak that you found in the house and the locket and the glasses all have magic but it seems like the magic has been fading rapidly since you brought them out of the house whatever was powering those things it is fading it they're still holding their magic to them but they appear to be losing some potency now the cape and the Wando that you found on Lenin's simulacra are still quite magical her her cape is a cape of the mountebank and once per day you can step into the cape and cast dimension door and disappear in a puff of smoke [Music] okay so discovering that I have the ability to thunder step can I try it do you want to teleport yeah is that okay I can move really quickly already something I can teleport but I can but you're so fast you might look really cool with a red cape colors I mean it's not your bullet you're blue right your stops believe are you willing to wear a red cape I'll be honest I mean your dad made my armor right now I really lost a lot of mine and I'm wearing like boots I found off a gnome that I murdered so there you go thank you nice I really it looks quite dashing are you actually I'm wearing a lot of your mom's old stuff wearing armor made by my dad my mom's glasses and my mom's old cloak getting more dragon home by the day I'm uh am i part of a family am i part of the crows no and what about this obsidian wand this obsidian wand has a screaming skull like face in it and it has it is a wand of fear it is a rare wand that requires attunement is seven charges and while holding the wand you can use an action to expend one charge and command another creature to flee or grovel as per the command spell or while holding the wand you can use an action expend two charges and to cause it to admit a cone of amber light and each creature in the cone must make a wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for one minute and all the creatures frightened in this way it must spend its turns trying to move as far away from as possible as you can and it can't willingly move closer to you it also can't take reactions sweet I'm a wand guy now I never thought I'd be a wand guy okay like as we're like leaving I'm like holding it out and be like Shh I can cast all my spells from this this is this is pretty cool yeah you can use it as an arcane focus for your spells as well guys do I look cool do I look cool holding out a wand no okay wait do I go more with like the the firm grip or do I go with like an elegantly I'm sure you'll naturally discover your foot all right this is gonna take a while but I got to find my like wand groove you know we as we laughs like the whole way walking back to the house so as you as you walk back to the house you just practicing when I'm practicing like different wand poses where do I hold it straight out do I hold it like oh and have you figured out where you hold it do you store it even a little your clothes I like my clothes I don't know I'm like practice like twirling it on my finger I'm like I see you dropping it just hear me like mumble things like I'm a wand guy mister wand nice to meet you I'm one no want to know where I got this one ever what no it's a wonderful wand you have there what's a wonderful life why I'm like you guys now realize that all my one-liners I go through about a hundred bad ones before I find one that works and even those aren't that good so [Laughter] how do I do that what's the cloak is it a row it is a tape of the mountebank now can we go over the the nuances between a cape and a clock oh we're gonna start that debate now yeah yeah so the properties of my keep it yes it is a cape of them gracias cool so you proceed back to the dilapidated crow Manor the house on the wrong side of town with the wrought iron fencing and the high steepled rooftops the boarded up windows which you broke down the door before as well Sebastian it feels as you approach that aura of unease around here still exists but it's a calmer one and as you head back through the house putting on the artifacts you can almost feel like their magic is being pulled back into them as they get closer to the mirror again and you step through the mirror into the dimension beyond and once again as you come down that long hallway you can hear the pitter-patter of that hound following you through the halls I want to try to pet it I'm not afraid of dogs I have a wand it as you reach reach out to touch it you can all hear the growling as you reach towards it oh sorry sorry hey boy we can actually see the hound no only Ludo wearing the glasses can see it okay I just say hey boy hey boy you know where is it show it to me I'm not feeling cool is it is it right next to me is it behind me gosh oh gosh is it it's is it just kind of following us and sniffing us again it's not here anymore guys don't worry that's fine everything's fine which way will you go now we have we not explored I'm a little a little disoriented my map once again just has question marks and lines in various directions and the words up and down about 20 times going over all the different ways it seems like they're from what you can recall and I'll help summarize this for you because there are a lot of different directions you haven't gone up the staircase in the barracks room also you did go through the double doors in the main foyer but then you went back the other way there's another set of double doors the end of that hallway yeah that could be because we were following in the footsteps they came back yeah I I think that would be a cool yes yeah it's like if we get a new house we got a a new place you got to like check out all the different level of look synchrony closets you have how many more how many more dungeon summoning do you mean summoning things yeah if we find another demon summoning circle should we not break it we'll cross that bridge yeah actually if anything yeah we created some sort of fun hazard anomaly an incident so you will open so to get back that way you'll need to leave your do you leave the equipment on the statue of level ass okay okay the halls now the melted water that was around here is mostly gone now just a few droplets almost just like water stains left on the floor is it been a day again we it's to make the morning moon I say okay yep I'm feeling much more confident being in here when I know there's not a crazy isolator you're wandering on yeah I feel a little calmer a little warmer in my soul does it feel warmer I don't know no I think it's gorgeous and the whole place still feels gloomy and hostile and cold I mean there could be other things in here Kilis but yeah it's fair okay let's as we go through the big doors mm-hmm and so anything we hear or see so beyond the great set of obsidian doors in the main foyer there is a long wide hallway pillared and with the same lights that were in the earlier hall it were those kind of black lights that were illuminating the hall which actually I think you shot out a few of these ones as well you know we've been breaking light the hall ends in another set of an obsidian doors said of obsidian double doors I knew we know should we see if they're open I guess that would be the logical choice who wants to push open the doors I volunteer myself as tribute these are the strongest yeah I can't I can't open these doors I'm not nearly strikes my muscles okay lady robe you dramatically pushed the doors open and as you do you can the sound of rushing wind fills your ears it's that sound of when you're in a the same sound of when you're in a speeding vehicle of Russia and the windows are down that rushing wind that being sucked out of the room almost because in this room part of the wall has broken away on the north side and what you can see in the on the north side of the room it looks like there was once a pillar or the base of a statue which is only left behind shattered and broken remains as if the statue was blasted back into the wall and the wall opened up and it's just opening into that inky blackness of this shadowy realm and there's a rushing of wind and licking shadows filling this room that are dancing against the green orbs which illuminate the rest of the room the whole room is very different from the other rooms it's still made of the same obsidian the same city in stone as the rest of the complex but intricate carvings have been created here it is a roughly rectangular room 60 feet wide but only 40 feet deep and the high ceiling still reaches up quite high as well ending in hardened 90-degree corners but they there are obsidian carvings all up the room depicting shadowy figures clashing against each other in some sort of cosmic conflict there are skulls undead creatures shadows elemental forces of all of darkness and cold colliding with each other and on the south end of the room the you can see the mural kind of clashes and it appears to be in the middle point of the room where the doors open up the carvings almost form what looks like the two sides of a battle on one side the carvings are of frost and ice and wind and shadows and the shapes of flying screaming crows and ravens and flocks of birds and almost would look like the ghosts of elves or banshees and this force of ice shot and shadow is clashing in the other carvings against Maccabi Ami's lumbering creatures and skeletons and the south side of the room there is another pillar base pillar of us of a great statue which is still in place perched on the statue is a massively obese creature that looks like the cross between an orangutan or a baboon but it has a massive distended belly in and it's a carving it's an obsidian statue that almost looks like it's intestines or spilling out from its guts and there's pustules all covering its its belly it's an intricate and lifelike almost like life carving it is big bat-like wings coming out of it and the head of a goat and cloven feet then it's perched on top and holding a great axe beside it in one hand and in its other hand it is holding a purple glowing crystal do I recognize this this figure like is it some is it meant to be a god or a demon has it like an have I ever heard of it monster the iconography is conflicting and strange give me an art onna check there's one last detail I must give as well spilling out from it it has eyes of crystal that are leaking and green goo almost like tears and they're coalescing driving down the Obsidian and forming cracks in the floor in front of it that are forming this bubbling green liquid on the ground in front of you I only got a seven this creature you've heard of cosmic conflicts between gods and demons the forces of shadow and darkness are not always in alignment with one another they are not monolithic this is depicting a battle between two great forces of shadow a battle which abstence ibly this goat baboon bat creature as one so which side am I on is there like in at the base of it is there anything written is there any like language there are the odd markings of runes describing everything in various forms and bastardized languages what languages you know celestial and infernal and common the script here here's two they're the the runes here are a bastardized version of infernal known as abyssal but she and so you can recognize them for what they are there's also some elven runes for shadow and frost that you can see around here but most of the other symbols and iconography unfortunately with Sebastian's check it's like I don't know what these mean seems to be some sort of magic your mom has like the gothy of ever seen that's I don't know it seems kind of weird that this was her kind of vibe and then meanwhile she gave birth to me on Halloween that's surprising well I don't know how do you time that how do you magic I feel like it was planned she's pretty magical it's true she could have just been like I'm gonna magically give birth now to a shadow sorcerer I just can't see your dad nearing someone like that it was like a very like humble blacksmith like regular dude and then here's like mom worshiping a goat that thanks and the clash of Darkness versus undead can a clone have babies I ask as a as a uninitiated why well because maybe your mom was a clone that you that your dad knew maybe you know maybe he didn't know the real one my real mom was a clone and you never knew real mom it's just brainstorming just brainstorming thinking inside the box like as I look at weird ruins and be like that looks hard to read I'm more like pointing out your like your mom might have been a clone I'm like you can read that oh no I have no idea what this says I'm more worried about these lights I'm still worried with these lights the only thing that strikes you is you examine the room is that the thing that this goat is holding is a piece of delirium yeah there's no way we disturb that or maybe we stand back and you grab it with me Jan yeah I mean at the ready again I say we smash out the lights first let's stand in the doorway let's stand in the doorway so that if it closes we end up on the a side the right side all right okay so we're all kind of peeking our heads in Michael watching you do your meeting and I'm gonna look a little mine not not the first time yeah no I'm not gonna use I'm just using a tick I'm practicing my wand music pointed out and a glowing purple hand emerges and moves forward and it scoops up the orb okay it is a perfectly spherical piece of delirium that it is picked up and as it lifts it up and see that it almost looks like this piece of delirium has been encased in spherical glass of some kind is it scoops up the orb and as you lift it up the a voice rings out in all of your minds and it it says in a deep booming voice that's not part of the bargain that's mine can you just clarify the terms of the bargain mister voice I like place it back in the hand but my mage hand is still on it come closer let me get a good look at you I'm gonna trust this I've put the orb back what's the worst that can happen why no no I'm staying I swear this is my new home don't worry I'm going to like clumsily try to grab at you but I'm trying to watch our backs as well so I don't really stop you we could learn something here guys okay Oh curious Sebastian steps forward and stands before the statue your majesty and like vows hmm you stand before the belly of death it's always good to see a wayward soul come back and visit me how are you finding the more world little warden it's been pretty good so far you know ups and downs you know do you know him fish out from the door you know him do you know him I know all come through my good domain I have eye weights mmm do you know me wait do people start off dead I'm confused when did when was I in your domain hmm before you came to this world and when you leave it you'll come back just like they all do how did you get here I I'm not here I am here know that I feel like as he's responding you're like picking up the globe and then putting it back and then begging it I'm like putting I love the mage hand on the on the or what were the terms of the agreement that were made I'm the new owner of this location new buyer just trying to get my lay on the land haven't signed the lease yet but only a pact for the greatest of my secrets secrets sold for a soul who saw the one whose soul is now bound to this place if that's what you call her Shh she offered you her soul in exchange for secrets she she died giving birth to me was that part of the arrangement I only offer knowledge not the wisdom to use it don't take the knowledge don't take it don't take the knowledge but you might be able to take the sphere take the orb take the orb what if I take the orb hmm you want this warp I haven't decided yet I this is a very interesting situation that I find myself in I might prefer knowledge you can buy knowledge you are uh you can read knowledge little wayward spirit getting through the gaps perhaps you should just come home not yet I have more work to do here if you want to stay you'll have to keep outrunning the hounds they miss you very much I told you dogs are trouble my power comes from you and your realm if I'm not mistaken no boy you very much are mistaken did you mean like Miss taken or mistaken I'm so sorry demon thing I said I why did my mother build this place why did she put you in here what knowledge was she after that's knowledge don't take it hey that's a question but maybe he can answer all of our questions then he'll take you and us I don't want no guys we have to get a rope around you again pull you out okay I get him they're walking into the room what do you know about my mom what's it worth to you I'm gonna put my hand on Sebastian shoulder come on buddy we're going down a weird road right now I could tell you very much but the cost I can always entertain the nice bargain demon you need to back up not physically because you're not here but from my friend stay away from him it's fashion leave the orb and the knowledge stay with your friends I pulled the mage hand off the orb no no like I don't pound up I leave the orb I move the mage and it disappears I wanted orbit oh you don't want the knowledge do you go out the orb I think it's bad either way I step away and kind of like turn away from the statue and turn back to Pluto and I'm like I don't I don't know I don't know let's take a minute and figure out where that hole came from fail it's a little breezy I think we let's get out of here for a second let's go see that out of the room that we don't know and think about this yeah we could find out what happened to my mom we could also figure out what like brought the meteor and blah blah yeah we could find out what brought the meteor we could find out maybe a way into the castle it's think you're forgetting your dad's words though that the past needs to be left in the past my mom built this place my mum put this here and she put a lot of crazy crap in here and she died doing it she didn't die doing it she died giving birth to me that's entirely different but you know it sounds like it's really that's something else that I want to know but I think knowledge is not worth your soul knowledge is power yeah but weird belly demon is not the place to get it get a book there's a bunch of books upstairs there's more research we can find and your soul is not worth the knowledge demon one last question yes what is your name that one will cost you for sure I was worth a try we'll see ourselves out now have a have a good day you turn to leave the doors slam shut oh oh now we're all in the room hello I pull out my wand watch a demon I have a wand you don't want to make a deal no you're not interested a I'm very interested but I need some time to contemplate you still haven't told me what the deal was that was previously made as I said that will cost you - this is why we're not getting along and there needs to be like how how do we have a sample can we have a sample of your knowledge yes yeah that's like if we could try some of your knowledge yeah what you're offering then I'd be more willing to give something for more of it see what I'm saying here right now only you're telling me is you're dark you're evil you're mysterious and for all I know I might die just talking to you so I'm you might stand how about we make a bet sounds were Sebastian are you a game one man I know something about you he's just taunting you now I'm afraid aren't you my little puppy I have been all my life show me that you're not afraid and I'll answer one question for you okay I know you're not afraid not afraid of a dog I will go hide in the corner okay okay prove it and the green tears coming from the statue turned black as an inky shadow drops into the ground in front of it and coalescence into the form of the hulking hound that has been following you through this complex the same found that has been following you your entire life Sebastian there this thing is horrifying yeah I'm back myself its eyes are an inky abyss its ma of teeth and leading to a throat of endless nothingness as it bellows out in front of you and the voice says one last time all you have to do is live real friendship [Music] yep oh wait no I'm gonna put me in the corner I'm back into the corner oh closer to the door like I didn't go very far on the room yet and I went up to you yeah they kind of like talk to you it's like my buddy Scott splitter Diamond Dogs I believe so we've killed a lot of nulls which are like dogs mm-hmm this is just another dog see that more like hyenas yeah yes this should be easier this is only like a nightmare from your whole life yeah it's only my worst nightmares come into reality and I just need to prove that I'm not afraid of it oh it's like what I imagine what my worst hours would be and and 24 hours ago you killed your mom with fire no valid job 14 Sebastian 16 3 I'd rather take this in Malak mom yeah very demons of life live demons in the form of dogs with like bellies coming out and dripping acid shadow knowledge is not what yeah I agree this goth aesthetic is not we're really changing the theme after we take over I'm I'm done with those incorporate some colors other than obscene yeah hey what goes well with us obsidian oh nice purples okay you look a north-facing so we pick a nice light yeah I'm like everything all assembled yeah okay so as it as the shadows uncoil onto the ground shadow dog in there it's just a wee puppy huh copies are vicious oh we didn't get rid of the lights oh yeah the lights all of the lights the I cores of the room coalesce into four more lurching shadows as the Hound takes its full form it is almost emaciated the whole Hound like it has that lean muscle to it that whole hulking upper body and thick limbs but you can still see that there's not like an ounce of fat on its body and its underside looks like it's been torn open you can see like the ribs and this just shadowy inky mass just leaking out from the bottom of it as if it's a rib cage was split open its jaw as almost split in half as well and these twisted shadows then take form in the room around you all as they begin to close in for the kill the first up to act is the Hound in Sebastian what is the name of the sound I had named it Reaper okay Sebastian how fitting that was before we started the campaign I named my my future puppy Reaper because I thought it was cute and now I wish it wasn't so we're gonna know how it got its name in a moment reaper lurches forward and as it does so the the shadows around it almost make it look like it is trailing its position and it's almost difficult to tell which is real its body or its shadow as it comes forward and attacks out coming to maul you Sebastian I'm not a flaw and it gets in an 18 and a 19 to hit it's thick as it rears back up it's thick claws rake into you and drag across your side and it bites down into your shoulder with its muzzle and in total you take 21 points of slashing and piercing damage okay okay okay cool it is your turn Sebastian I have a rules related question very quickly if I cast a spell as a bonus action can I then use a wand as an action yes you can okay cool I am going to Pluto you're coming with me Jerry goin we're gonna thunder step just to the back of the room because I feel very surrounded right now okay so I grab Pluto and I'm going to just be like I need out and that that should hit a few of the shadows and the Hound as well yeah it's a ten-foot radius so yeah the closer to shadows and the Hound yeah great so I got to make Constitution saving throws for the first shadow gets a natural one so does the second shadow and Reaper gets a big old pen also sorry I meant to kind of say this I'm going to use to two points too quick and that's okay nice sixteen damage okay the two shadows are bloodied she want to mark them both with his bloodied superb and then as my action because that was my bonus action I'm going to cast use my cone of fear from my wand and I hold out the wand and I yell run how that has a 60 foot cone yeah and you can hear the voice the laughing of the creature as it says they are fear incarnate [Laughter] none of them a they're all immune to the frightening condition I was hoping something in there would catch but okay it was worth a shot does this make you afraid yes in fact because you are facing your deepest fear I need you to make it make a wisdom saving throws right now I got a five ok you are frightened so on your next turn you will be running as fast as you can away from everything hmm there's a big hole you don't have to run somewhere where you can't we're not you're not going to be safe but you must spend your action on your next turn to run okay okay cool alrighty we now go to Vail oh I'm scared out of my mind so I'm gonna back myself as far as I can into a corner take out my bow and I'm aiming at that crazy scary dog using my dread ambusher so I'm gonna take three attacks from my first firm No who are you attacking okay you disadvantage on your attack rolls one so i okay that's the so the first shot it seems like the arrow sailed rate through it way through it was and just didn't do anything hmm a second attack seven again you're shooting at shadows I try it one more time go for veil that does find something yeah that would apply to the the extra attack that you make with the dread ambusher eighteen damaged out shooter oh yeah as it does so that the it it makes that kind of canine whimper as the arrow strikes it and for a moment all the flickering shadows around it stop and it coalesce is almost into a single form for a moment it will no there will no longer be disadvantage on attacks against it until it starts the ability again next up are the shadows the shadows Flickr and flit sailing towards each of you what one of the shadow two of the shadows fly towards pollute Oh the other two towards veil as the voice cries out little wayward spirit the shadows will consume your friends their speed is 40 feet it can all make you inner ones are bloodied the two outer ones are noisy I get a 19 and a 18 against Pluto one hit one nests and a eight and a nine against Pluto you take seven necrotic damage Oh your strength is reduced by two shadow throwing shade is the as basically the the creatures these shadowy creatures basically had no arms or limbs they're just tendrils of shadow that strike out and like a whip they kind of form around and just sting right towards your heart and you just feel it almost like piercing like a mosquito and and you feel it's a pure strength it went through the same hole that the yep okay next up Pluto it's your turn I scream in pain as my heart is stabbed because I think that's an appropriate response i flutter milady cape and then I pull out my drift globe and I cast a light okay and I cast it on the Hound can I point it can I do it on a thing on a thing or on a point I choose in the middle of the room okay sunlight emanates from the room and the shadows will now have disadvantage on their tackles but the as a creature of pure shadow stuff the hound isn't we can buy it but it isn't doesn't like it so yeah well take that dog nice move anything else Pluto I'm gonna hold my heart okay we go to the top of the round with the with Reaper the Mastiff who needs to find a spot where he can actually get into fight there okay he's going to misty step right up behind Sebastian and Landy and Sebastian with his claws so he basically instead of a Miss you step is more like a shadowy step the the dog falls back into its own shadow like it collapses into into the shadow that then slink sacrum along the ground and then pops right back up behind Sebastian and just rakes right down your back it gets a 12 and an 18 to hit even with shield it would match my AC so that's still the answer there's no foot okay one hits one hits okay yeah it's gonna be ten points of slashing damage do I get a shot at the dog are you adjacent to it I guess no if he's on the other side yeah okay sounds good yeah it's kind of come right up behind so okay I'm trying to protect you thank you okay cool we go to Sebastian so Sebastian you are frightened and you can't willingly move source to do so closer to the source of your fear because of the feared condition that you're afflicted by supernaturally in this room you need to spend your action to move away from the dog so whichever path you can get that I am screaming climbing through your legs being like this is it this is how I die I saw it in my dreams please don't let it get me Oh mr. demon I am afraid I am afraid the demon just last one crawl back to your grave [Music] okay so you provoked an opportunity attacks from the shadow and the dog so the dog gets a 18 to hit you and the shadow who's got disadvantaged only gets an 8 because of the daylight so I get you one more time with Reaper who gets a good old max damage there so so 16 points of damage so this is where my wonderful feature what is it called strength of the grave is going to come into effect okay because I'm at zero hit points mhm so I need to roll a charisma saving throw that is five plus the damage taken okay so what was the damage taken it was uh it was sixteen points so you need 21 and busy dizzy get two minus the extra is that how does it work if I if I only take you and I eat cake by more than my hit points worth of damage yes you can okay I'm down okay you go down you so as you as you lunge away from Sebastian Sebastian as you lunge away your I'll say that you kind of died because you tried to like crawl and you just collapse and as you fall to the ground at the other end under my under me yeah underneath pollito I'm standing on your corpse cool now you're up sever strike which doesn't give me opportunity attacks mm-hmm you're right beside me right I turn and use one use of my healing kit okay you stabilize you boom you're stabilized and then I [Music] feline agility and I run to the other side of the room okay so you basically pull out pull out the Heelers kit and bandage him up really really quick to stabilize him like rub some dirt in it basically and he's stable and then you rush to the other side of the room okay we need to get some hits on those things also there are two bloody shadows I can't talk okay these shadows the two shadows that were on you veil follow you to the other side of the room do they get to her 40 feet speed yeah and how you would have gone all the way okay so they they just beeline right after you but they have to use all their movement and action to do that but they continue to pursue you the other two go right for Pluto but because of the daylight spell they have disadvantage on their attacks one still manages to get a twenty oh great and the other only gets a nine okay so Pluto you take seven points in the chronic damage and lose four points of strength my armor is getting really heavy what's your strength down to big old twelve okay so yeah your armor is now too heavy for you so you're you're encumbered by it so your speed is reduced by five feet guys we're gonna die we're gonna die we're gonna die it is your turn though Polito aha I say hit the bloodied one kill something I don't feel so good are realz alright we're more this is getting just had to just we love demons don't we okay so the both of them are kind of on me yeah the two bloodied ones yep and they're like and the demons dog the demon dog is coming after Sebastian demon dog stay and can i I want to throw my javelin mm-hmm and call Elvan lightning and throw it at the dog and we'll the lightning explosion hit the the shadowy people's yeah yep then Mike okay so so yeah I realized that we I didn't move the shadows from from last turn so they would have had to move so you could position yourself in such a way that you could throw the javelin and hit all three of them well good yeah I'm gonna use my first attack first to stab the first one and then wind up and then throw okay so uh 19 to hit that it's safer for oh wait no my damage has gone way too hard for nine damage okay that bloody is the Mastiff and the the lightning damage against the shadows 22 to hit the you just roll the damage against the shadows yeah it's 46 lightning and I have to make dexterity saving throws for them which I fail but I make for the dog 15 damage they are destroyed the two shadows are both destroyed by the lightning so you fire the javelin of lightning dispersing the shadows with Korona of electrical energy and it also severely wounds the shadow Mastiff were those both the bloodied ones yep oh and and the dog takes an extra seven damage from the javelin javelin okay so he takes 15 I guess half plus the seven yeah and then I'm going to rush the dog okay and I'm gonna slam it into the ground with my nice nice so you basically run forward to retrieve the spear slamming the dog into the ground getting at 17 I get a 15 whoa so you push it to the ground it just are down down down and it slides across the ground and as it and starts to kind of like coalesce around cool we go to the top of the round with the shadow Mastiff it leaps to its feet and the shadows come back around it once more and it so once again it's got its disadvantage or a happening and it just goes right for you Pulido getting a 10 to hit and a 19 to hit the 19 ties okay that's gonna be 12 points slashing damage I'm gonna repost okay just can I can I punch it yeah I mean the spear is right there you could have picked it up at the end of a turn yeah I'm gonna do that so I wanted to miss 19 to hit that hits for 11 damage I'm so nice nice okay that was just your riposte so Sebastian over to you so you're stable roll a d20 if you have 20 you wake up that's a that's an 18 okay but you are stable anyway it's pretty good I opened my eyes for a second and I see Pluto fighting the dog and I just go back fair cool you know again wanting to get away from these shadows I casts another zipper strike my bonus section and I rush across diagonally to the room okay so again I can make it 60 feet diagonally and I turn around and I take two shots at the closest shadow to me okay so you're going to leap across the pools of ice and shoot them nice the closest shadow with my first shot 17 that's a hit nice okay oh man fourteen plus two eight thirty thirty damage the shadow is just destroyed even though it only takes half damage for the attackers of its resistance it's just wiped out my damage and I take the second shot at the other shadow for ten ten tend to hit yeah that is a Miss I'm afraid it just sails right through the shadowy tendrils okay the shadow flies back towards you veo in pursuit I like how you're just making this shadow chase you around yep chasing shadows this time it gets an 18 a hit yes it's gonna be 13 necrotic damage and you lose two points of strength as it finally reaches out with its shadow tendrils and rakes through your body sending a chill going through your entire system I just did override yeah I'm just gonna recently okay Pluto you're up it's Pluto's turn yeah I'm going to beat a dead dog that's not good but I'm gonna I got to do it like I'm going with it stabby stabby 22 to hit for nine damage so I'm just like yeah stop dodging my friend you are a mean dog 22 to hip or another six damage alrighty does it even care that I'm stabbing it you're just slashing it and slashing it and slashing it did you roll those and as you do hacking away at these shadows as just starts to disintegrate into tatters and the shadows fall to the ground like ribbons and are gone and I keep attacking where it was mm-hmm in in a in a sort of dramatic overly dramatic way I like that yeah I'm like really trying to sell it like I'm stabbing it with that nice boom and then I run over to Sebastian and cradled his head okay and I and I go are you oh you don't have to be afraid anymore I'm so scared I'm so scared and I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you one of your health a greater healing or with the regular kind yeah greater cool you know and I say and I make you guzzle it and again I'm just making this way more dramatic than it needs to be like oh we're back oh yeah I killed your dog well actually I don't know if it died it just kind of just there's still a shadow over there yeah as you wake up Sebastian you can still see the Hound in the corner and it's just sitting in the corner of the room where the shadowy ribbons that Pluto tore apart our oh wait sorry was there still another shadow yeah I assume that they'll can definitely deal with it on her return yeah we can we can rap it's okay we went into a traumatic moment yeah it was good it was good I I'm cool okay shadow was killed by there yeah yeah yeah we're and with with the final hound it just dissipates Hey hey demon I passed your test I wasn't afraid at all not even once I like wipe a bunch of spit out like a bunch of blood I mean whatever I was afraid I'd leave this wasn't my test oh yeah I was actually afraid too I am unconvinced but this hound shall follow you till the end of your days as a reminder of the fear that you could not overcome that you needed these pathetic the help of your pathetic friends to survive but you may call on it and maybe one day you will not Revere it anymore did you miss the sweet thunder step I did whatever it's eat ration you may ask of me one question okay so we're all like huddled around like guys I just gained a pet dog should I ask him what we should name it no bad idea yeah should we ask him something obviously about your mom just ask him where is your mom but what if the answer is dead where where's your mom's soul why did you build this place he said she was here yeah so listen what if we what if we ask man well you remember you said you want to know why what's his name she built the place why she builds please ask carefully I have much knowledge but I cannot answer all questions anything within my knowledge so cool anything that is within my knowledge I can we know what's it within your knowledge first because I feel like it's a waste no I would that would be a pretty fair demon if I let you get away with that much he said he knew something about me yeah what does he know Oh maybe yeah what is that is that but I feel like there's way but like why did the meteor hit dragon high question if we want more questions answered can we fight more demon dogs that's not know wishing for more wishes okay do I ask what is the demon know about me do I ask are we sure like there's so many other things we could ask where is your dad the possibility his treasure you talked about you talked about or he talked about um knowing that you came from here he said you came from here I did he say all of us K you came from so what like maybe there's he he has something to do with the meteor or your birth how do how do i word that like what what ties me does this this is your birth tied to the meteor or does your power tied to the meteor and how is your time know how how and it's okay we don't have to think it we don't have to worry too much like we'll get other answers elsewhere I'm sure there's other demon if there's a pressing thing on your mind I want you to follow your heart rate agree with that yeah I'm into it you faced your fear you said you said you knew something about me I want to know what connection I have to the events that have taken place in Drakon hi I'm with my mom with this house with with all of this there's there's something here that connects me to this and there's something you know about me hmm I know much but you've asked more than one question they're mortal you want to know of your connections to that blasted city to your mother to this place to this village to your birth you may ask of me one and I will tell you what I know it seems fitting since we're in the house that I was born in dealing with the sanctum that my mother constructed what why was my birth what it was the the the storm the undead the the shadow magic the what was was what was my mom doing that caused this whole thing that caused me she was only doing what I taught her how to do and in that trade a soul for a soul you rode into this world from a realm of shadow from deep within my belly wayward spirit that you are and now here you stand in this world she traded her soul for me she chose to sacrifice yourself to bring me here I'm just asking for clarification that's not a second question [Laughter] good clarifier he the voice pauses for one maybe call him like start to butter him up a bit oh great demon oh handsome some full belly full belly demon I think he likes that step wings compliment his wings with the most glorious wings and the weirdest funny the weirdest face if you want the answer to that question you'll have to ask your mother come on mom's dead she died you said that she sacrificed her soul to bring me here your mother is dead I'm getting a few more answers out of this ok that's wait but there but but demon lord oh great knowledgeable demon if you want those answers they're going to cost you more and that's where we're gonna end for tonight come here puppy no it's not does the dog just hang out next to me now we have issues can I see it is it there now well depending on your next move you you guys have definitely gained enough XP to level up which does mean that you will be able to summon you are a little shadow Mastiff now and yeah we'll we'll take it from there that'll be some interesting things I think for next time all of you can prepare your level up but you will will take that from when when you take a rest next if you want to continue there's still more to explore here but this is a pretty big milestone and if you still want to talk to this big old demon then we'll see if you want to cook up some more deals oh no listen I may have nine
