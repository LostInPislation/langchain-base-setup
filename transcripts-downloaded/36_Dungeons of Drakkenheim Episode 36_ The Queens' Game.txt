return to the ruins [Music] Drakken homers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon heuerman comets rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon Heim when last we left our heroes a standoff has taken the halls in the ancient altar room of the grand Cathedral of Saint Vitruvian this ruins of Drakon Heim as the sunlight reflects across the mirrored and vaulted dome above sending light glittering down the chamber and reflecting off of the flames of Ignatius the sword of burning truth as our heroes stand in standoff between the assembled forces of the hooded lanterns the silver order and many more for they have assaulted Elena Kruger in a moment of snap judgment to call her out before the assembled host and quite a host has been assembled here indeed for before you in the halls and the altar room and the altar and the the nave of the grand Cathedral of Saint Petruchio between the grizzled and veteran members of the hooded lanterns in the silver order each of whom who has fought valiantly in the battles dust thus far the heaviness in their eyes shows the grim determination that each bear itching as they sense the coming conflict wrote rising front-and-center before them in this room are assembled the Lord Commander Elias Drexel the night captain Theodore marshal the flame keeper of philia read drexels lieutenants Petra an anthem of the hooded lanterns and the Royal Guard attending Queen Lenore River and Eldrick are here as well representing the amethyst Academy and across the room Lucretia and Mathias stares you down from a crowd with piercing eyes her thin face held with pursed lips she's simply adorned in penitent robes with a hooded shawl grasping her tome the testament of the falling fire before her she is whipped cord then as we go around the hall Eldrick rune weaver is a tall black man with square Cuthbert grey beard is his long pockmarked face with rounded features and his amber eyes glow softly behind his circular glasses as he scans the room intently he wears the formal robes the amethyst Academy and he carries an ash wood staff tipped with a glass covered orb of delirium there's a heavy chain necklace around his neck with a locket and beside him as a towering construct of wood and stone it's eyeless gaze cast from a bulbous helmet a large delirium shard is built into its chest beside him stands river her hood down her blue hair flowing out around her as she too holds a wand now tipped with delirium she holds herself with an unsteadiness that you haven't seen in her before as her eyes dart across trying to read the situation across you his Warhammer drawn Theodora marshals the night captain looks at you with his grizzled and newly scarred face behind the eyepatch that's over his left eye left eye hmm and you can really see now like when you first met him he had this gleaming armor and he is just covered in mud and blood he was clean-shaven when you first met and now he just has doubly reading to the choir I mean he's holding that his war hammer out like he's ready to drop judgment on the situation beside him is a Fiat is is a philia Reid and her large round face between over Neath underneath the flame keeper shawl that she wears but she still has a jade like she's worn chainmail and armor as well and she grips the torch that all flame keepers carry as the symbol of the sacred fire almost ready to use it to light the brazier in front of you the altar of the sacred fire that is at the heart of the grand Cathedral Elias Drexel cracks his knuckles and rolls his broad shoulders he's got this big armored pauldrons and the long cloak of the hooded lanterns behind him and again he's just become a grizzled man with all the battles that he's seen he normally keeps his long hair quite braided but it's come apart in certain sections his beard is longer than it's ever been and he's just scowling at the entire situation of course across the room Queen Lenore looks like an opulent living doll in Her Majesty she is wearing an immaculate green gown of tinsel satin a corset embroidered in gold and silver sable gloves and she has a big fan rough around her neck clearly several hooded lanterns have found this amazing dress I'm wearing the ruins because you've never seen her wearing this beat before she's dripping with jewelry and upon her face is a porcelain mask and atop her head is a headdress and wig you cannot see her expression for every inch of her is clothed concealing her twisted features and across gripped in Petra's desperate arms as she looks at you for an answer as to what to do next is Elena Krieger a Krueger a short blonde haired woman with grizzled features and a tough exterior she's smiling wickedly we're also wearing the uniform and green cloak with golden trim of the Royal Guard over her padded gambeson although her weapons have been stripped from her [Music] there is a pregnant silence as everyone meets each other's gaze and finally the Lord Commander says all right you three need to explain yourselves immediately what is going on I mean where do you want us to start we were just calmly collecting bones of a dragon and or yeah the flame keeper and we found a sword and we came up here and Elena is not who she says she is and that's what the sword told us Theodora Marshall turns to a philia reed and he says now flame keeper is that indeed that flaming sword of truth is that as naked Neiges is that the sword of saint for true vo and a philia replies why yes I'd never thought I'd see it but that is Ignatius it cannot abide any deception it cannot abide any word of lies well it has drawn and held aloft and I mean this is why we had to act it's why we had to do what we did is because yeah Pluto is is the keeper of this sort now and and we act together as a group so if he said that she was not telling the truth we had to do something she said some words right before this whole incident occurred and those words were that the Korean was here and so was Lenore now I know of two people who go by the name Queen Queen Lenore and one other I think everybody in this room knows who that other person is now why would Elena say something so bizarre the Lord Commander looks and scans over Elena and the look that looks back towards you you accused one of my soldiers once already Rowlf vogner and when I questioned him he was incoherent mumbling he didn't remember what had happened to him for weeks are you saying that the same thing has happened to Elena let me paint a picture for you Lord Commander it's vogner that we had before so vogner was the queen of Thieves well the queen of thieves kept the real vogner imprisoned but the queen of thieves knew that we knew that so switch was made which made us look like idiots the Queen Ursula was still gaining Intel from the hooded man turned somehow we had our theories but being wrong before made us question coming out with those theories but now we stand with a sword that tells the chart says lies lies the whole time of the deception and he didn't say anything why did he lie why didn't he tell him right away Shh it's okay it's okay and I start to pet the hilt and in a calming and I go Lord Commander that's not true we knew Elena was the Queen for quite some time but we couldn't prove it to you and we had been when we tried to make the statement we were wrong before so we were worried that if we made the statement again and were incorrect I mean at some point you would stop trusting us so we needed to find a way to corner her where she couldn't escape just like she did when she was imitating Ralph Wolf's partner Bogner you're saying that Elena is not Elena but Elena is the queen of Thieves she looks like Elena and Elena is somewhere else hopefully not dead but likely imprisoned until she's ready to be released back when the Queen needs to move targets again just that Sebastian pounced on the opportunity actually technically veo pounced on the opportunity and we decided that enough is enough and she couldn't hide in plain sight any longer and Ignatius is telling me most of this well well done it looks like we've got dragon Himes Most Wanted then if what you say is true well your majesty what do you have to say for yourself maybe I should let the three of you ask the first questions then hey so do you do you happen to have like our stuff that we can get back we're going right to that yeah let's do it very intimidating veil yeah I mean to be honest she's very intimidating to me so um I'm glad we could get her around with all these witnesses this makes me feel much stronger about doing this she beat us up before by the way I think first of all Elena in front of all of these people can we just drop the act and yeah kill the charade she says the smile wipes from her face for a moment and a small look of panic comes over her face and she jewels and says my name is Elena Krieger I'm soldier of Western our sworn wrong our two queen Leonor von Kessel did she do her thing oh she hasn't nothing from the sword what does the sword say she the only the sword only told me that she passed her save right so she's probably lying now wait a few minutes ago you said you had you said you're not who you say you are a few minutes ago being two weeks ago you said you're not who you say you were and that you have nothing to hide you don't have who you think you have at all you don't have me you have nothing I'm no one and you took quite the gamble I knew that you were going to betray me of course you know that they've been working for me this entire time that's Ignatius what are you sure you have the currency to play at the high rollers table are you really ready to play at this little game yes yeah Elena yes I don't stand for bullies in Drakon hymen there's a whole lot of bullies trying to cut their piece of the pie out of this city and you've been one of the biggest bullies of them all yeah you're mean yeah and you can't you can see the knife that your throats the dagger at your hearts the sword poised over your heads waiting to strike or the fumes hang in the air waiting for the match to strike if you think I'm a bully you want to play the real game look around at everyone in the room right now and let that sink in for a moment at who is here in one place Elena I didn't say you were the only bully like I said this city's full of them there's an issue in Drakon hime in case people here didn't notice and since we have everybody together I think it might be best if we try to work out the major issues because at the end of the day we could be at each other's throats this could turn into a massacre or we could realize that the real enemies are the monsters the the people who have taken Drakon hime the people who want to claim it for themselves and each of you keeps arguing that you want to claim it for yourself but there's so much potential in this room to do something good and to maybe make things better and now is the opportunity for us to figure out where everybody stands also are you are you gonna murder us all please don't I just wanna I know it's I know before you left us alive because you like us and you think we're useful are we still useful Elena don't want queen of thieves don't start bowing to her already well what is she design cam he says well we have her I mean if we've got her right here what is she gonna do with all of us assembled here together it doesn't even matter it she can't fight us all clearly lady whoever you are it's time to just give it up now I mean we could why should we even bargain with a thief I think you might be gone night commander we've dealt with her a few times and let's just say that anytime that you think you might have the upper hand even in this situation I'm making a bold play there's a sliver of a chance that the queen of Thieves the queen of thieves is a crafty lady and she always has a trick up her sleeve I don't think she's as cornered as we believe she is which is why I'm relying on the fact that everybody's here to mean that hopefully we're not all going to die and I know this sounds kind of silly but I think we're all kind of coming to this realization now it's super scary now it does now I'm just it's kind of dawning on me I mean the moment I was pointing my wand I started to second-guess the queen of Thieves yes what where but we're sticking to it we're following through yeah sword nope so Elena says you want to talk then you all want to invite these wizards over here and these this prophet down here is that what you call yourself prophet and our good old queen royalty to another royalty to just have a nice little conversation about how we're all going to get along I mean I doubt everybody's gonna get along but ideally yes we're just trying to go with it we were just here clicking bone Lenore speaks up she says this woman is an impostor who claims a royal mantle with no purpose with no right Lord Commander she is a criminal she shall be apprehended and executed on the contrary she is incredibly good at gaining information finding out secrets and knowing things that nobody else knows about this city so I wouldn't be too quick to executors given the fact that she might be one of our best resources I disagree I think we should kill her now Lord goodnight captain says I'm in cloud to agree I think she's a huge threat I I agree with the Lord Commander and the Queen I think we should just kill her right now if you think she's put herself in a position where she could be killed that easily I think you're greatly under estimating her finally someone takes a little bit of sense actually I would just like to impose a small restriction of my own and just ask that we all interact a little bit amber amicably for the time being at least if you're going to execute Lord Commander night commander she's not going anywhere I want to hear what everybody is bringing to the table before we go ahead and start executing you want to make a deal with us thief I want to hear possibilities she has a right to a trial and I think that Lucretia Mathias speaks up she has something that they want yes but I think if he consider calling her a thief and they want it back very bad that badly and they know that if they kill her they will never get it I mean we've all done some things in strike and I'm you know began so we're not proud of so we've had some missteps so you were working with her Lord Commander you knew under a pressured foot you sent us in to gain Intel and we told you exactly what happened down there and that we agreed to work with her so that we could secure our safety and leave since that moment have we done any action to go against you or your commands what does she have on use of dirt yeah what does she have she has information that no one else in Drakon hime has been able to give us she also robbed us yeah she also has my stuff but the information is about my father and I don't love her and I don't see anybody else around dragon hi I'm offering that to us I know a lot of things about a lot of people Lord Commander including you great dirt dirt dirt like I said she's great at gathering information he replies what you think you know elder guru never speaks up you're all talking in circles she is some sort of thief what does she do what does she have magic all over her you don't even know anything about what's going on with her that poor girl right there that's nobody but who exactly who she says she is she's in spelled spell well then at least we have the queen of Thieves in our presence through her deed therefore execution should probably be off the table because like I said the queen of Thieves is crafty the Lord Commander turns to Alaric and says Eric what do you mean I can see it the aura powerful enchantment magic it would be the type of magic that would be a a mage of the eighth circle would need to be necessary to cast such a spell to hold someone's mind in their grasp to dominate persons spell this is the real Elena Krieger she is who she says she is but there's someone who's controlling her like a puppet I too knew this all along now shut up Ignatius what the with the person need to be casting the spell be the person that's possessing them or could somebody cast it to have one person possess another person I don't know everything about this spell except to recognize it it's a powerful one indeed but normally you would have to cast the spell yourself to master the spell yourself in order to hold the strings so whoever this queen of thieves is he's more than just a thief Oh certainly she she has a lot of people that work for her and she has a lot of power in this city and under estimating her would be a dire mistake for any of us to make a philia read says we should release the girl I can undo the spell now we will just release her and be done with it we don't need to execute anybody I'm sorry Ophelia but I think she's one of the major players here and she needs to be part of this conversation she does deserve a seat at the table with everything that she's shown she can do for better or for worse to help her hinder but she's not even here like a proxy yeah it's so we've got nothing it just means that you can't execute her but we can still hear her outs the amethyst Academy the hooded lanterns the knights of the silver order the queen of Thieves Queen Lenore and Lucretia Matthias and ride I wish to raise one issue if you wish to speak in the Academy the Amazons Academy can no longer abide the XD at ignore ignore this escalating situation here in Drakon hime and we are prepared to offer our assistance however the amethyst Academy has more secrets than you know truths and we will not tolerate interrogation we wish to discuss in good faith but the confidentiality in the discretion of the amethyst Academy is paramount if you cannot accept these terms we cannot offer our resources I think we can meet you on that but there are certain truths that might need to be Shon light upon the amethyst Academy will not be held to any form of magical compulsion and we will invoke the 13th Edict of lumen in order to protect it that blade is to be sheathed during these discussions we will not allow it that makes discussing things difficult around Pluto where's the problem is Eldrick the blade still has an essence about it oh it does but you keep that thing sheath it will swell away from us well I'm sure it will easy you keep that thing sheathed and well away the amethyst Academy does not consent to any form of magical interrogation understood if the blade causes Pluto Jackson to act it is not Pluto Jackson it is the blade the blade and under no circumstances will I tolerate you harming him in any way I don't need to harm him to hold him back good as long as that emotions and the the machine behind him just goes joke joke that's not harming him you have to fight that one day am i you're gonna have to keep that sword in check I think if this is all gonna work out but the sword was like our truth sir I don't know man I don't know I don't know how to navigate this this this is already getting Rocky the too many cooks in the kitchen there's very little that we can do if he's going to invoke the edicts of lumen then we are pressed the terms arranged between the church and the amethyst Academy after the acquittal Inquisition if they're gonna invoke them we have to hold we have to obey okay I will reluctantly and while making eye contact with Alina put away the sword and I'm glaring well at least I do not even know why you would want to talk to these mages they have nothing they know nothing of truth and they just they know nothing of what lies before you marvel at their majesty and power says Lucretia Matthias but their's is just of this world it is nothing before faith I've learned anything about truth since I started this whole whole ordeal is a truth is a matter of perspective you have your truths they have theirs truth is not a matter of perspective young one and you would do well to remember that there is one truth in this world and that is the flame it illuminates all and shows us the path forward there is no subjectivity before the flame there is no there can be no doubt before it oh cool cool cool cool cool cool you know neat sounds good Lucretia so glad you could make it the party so happy you so happier here ran and knew this game knocking that was sarcasm I'm gonna put away the blade so can we agree to talk then about Drakon time about what's going on in this city but what we're trying to do and what each person thinks they deserve from it there is no need to shed blood salvation Elias I hope not [Music] neither do i but i won't hesitate if we have to this is this this city this city and the sovereignity of west amar will not be abandoned well we have our queen Leonor and the results of the vault we have the path forward we can find the truth even if it hides from us my thoughts exactly so you three you're gonna moderate this little discussion of ours that could be a good role for us we I think that the three of us are major players in this bias too we have been kind of yeah where Pluto just said we're an unbiased party we've met with each of you you all have a lot to offer some of you scare me I glanced at Elena and Lucretia but for the most part there's something that each of us could bring to the table I don't expect all of us to work together but in order to save Drakon Heim we're going to need more than just the guard of the city we're gonna need people and I think we need to know where your loyalties lie I think you haven't shown that by now then I mean I feel like that's a little bit of a lost cause no offense says Elena good friends your word is not worth too much I mean I knew you were gonna betray me and you did I have to admit I'm curious who are you in bed with actually and Oh Lucretia speaks up do you walk in shadow or do you walk in the light that's that's a weird question to ask me shadow are you mercenaire are you mercenaries cuz you can be worth your purpose if you're that if you want money you want your own worth but what separates an ally from an asset that's loyalty where do we stand right now Knight commander in this Cathedral - Reese ank 2phi it after defeating the Lord of the feast after rallying the silver order and the hooded lanterns behind a single cause we have came here we went into the crypts the three of us to retrieve those bones we found the sword of Ignatius if you're questioning whether or not what we're doing is good for the city of trackin Heim then I'm wondering where your loyalties lie because I thought it was obvious that we were working together now I must say you three you're brave you're bold you're smart too smart enough that can't be denied oh and we've shed blood together spilt it to three of us you three us Lord Commander we make a pretty good team I got a say but I also gotta say that this situation is spinning out of control and here in this city being in it near this Cathedral we're hanging on by a thread in here you know that you we it took everything we had to get this far and once a philia lots the flames here in the cathedral it will be a bastion of lot but I look through the city and the only hope I see is inflamed when and I'm glad I had that when we started when I started my journey with these two it was about surviving it was about just living and getting by but through our journey through our time together through meeting all of the factions I've realized that there's such a bigger purpose here than just living in a ruined city there was a city that was beautiful and full of life and had so much purpose before this and although a terrible accident destroyed what used to be the potential here for that city for that kind of place is still still at the end of the tunnel the light at the end of the tunnel but if we squabble and and crawl over each other to get what we want rather than just working together that's what we're here to do is try to bring some semblance of what it used to be with all the factions together so if you ask where our loyalties lie our loyalties are to Drakon Heim BAM couldn't have said it better myself Caspian where do your loyalties really lie I mean from my national anthem it's always caspia that's just part of our thing but in truth I want to see Jack and I'm restored and it doesn't take a sword to tell me that I gotta say it even though the sword is literally screaming in my ear if that's what I'm saying I will bleed to my last drop says the Lord Commander if it means restoring the city and if that's what you want then I will work with you to do that the night captain shakes his head friends Lord Commander being in the city I can tell you that I can sense the corruption hangs heavy over the city - it's very core you all know that it's even gripped the noble crown of West amar with respect we have shed blood together in battle and I will draw sword with all you again but there might be no end of the monsters here I think we got to burn the city to the ground we can rebuild we control the walls we control the cathedral we can set up flame breaks we can preserve the sacred sites we can preserve the castle but I think we got to burn every answer that this city to the ground we got the materials we can go we can send a lumen and have more brought in and we should burn every last building with the ground there will be nowhere for monsters to hide no more bandits to hide they will have to face us in the open field it will take advantage of all the advantages that we have we can fight them like a real enemy we can't be skulking around in the rooms of the city trying to look for things that are lost we can rebuild it but we're gonna have to rebuild it we can just burn the whole thing to the ground that's not how you find the needle you don't you don't burn the haystack you gotta keep trying to find the needle and it's gonna get frustrating but I don't think there is a needle to thought we just found some pretty big needles recently down in the crypts literally there's needles everywhere we have a potential to reclaim the throne of Drakon hi-oh and from there and all branches outwards under one banner the dragon hunt banner Lord Commander you're the remnants of the city guard but you got to have something to guard you don't want to be doing this forever we need somebody in that throne somebody in control the three of us came to Dragon hime with our own motives some of us wanted to find family some of us wanted to learn truths and some of us also want to learn truth yeah there's a lot of truths and there's a lot of family through through the time here we've learned that together there can be change in this city we can make a change but we can't do it alone so you're gonna be the remnants of the city guard or we're gonna need more people than that there used to be a tower here that the amethyst Academy controlled it's still kind of half there it's mostly there in order to restore this city the amethyst Academy is gonna have to continue to work within these walls why because they can do good work [Music] the Knights of the silver order I don't know where they stand they want to burn this whole city to the ground think we'd appreciate if you did and if that's the case then why are we lighting the fire in this church why are we making this this Cathedral such a bastion of hope if your next move is to burn it to the ground we're not gonna need to burn the Cathedral but we'll have to raise everything else yeah well honestly if you want to rebuild a city can be rebuilt there aren't any people living here anymore oh but there are but there's so many ask Elena there's a potions guy walking around what's his name Cornelius Mortimer big sweet yeah he saw a light here and he wanted to start his family Oh what did you do today the city is of no consequence before the flame there is no truth to be found in that castle or in that tower because there is some truth to be found here Lucretia you're the only one that I don't know what to do it yeah you're definitely like you show up here with all of your followers and a bunch of people with crystals in their chests preaching the truth and the light but you wouldn't let us in to learn about it unless we jammed a crystal in our chest which is absurd that's like a to demand that if you want to be part of this then you're gonna have to tell us what you think is your truth and we can decide if we agree or not there is a great purpose coming for the flame and my only wish is that all souls are ignited once more we have been taught that it is only by our death that we join the flame that is what these they will tell you but it is not so I say through life may our souls be ignited once more that is the truth that is the truth that has been hidden from us it is not by any deed by any valiance but by faith that we are reborn and if you wish to have a new nation one that it cannot be built upon the truth of the faith is about a hollow shell your pupil spoke of an age of Heroes right well got bad news for you lady you're looking at your heroes not just us three the Lord Commander Petra Ansem the knight commander o philia read so many people in this room have risen up in the 15 years that this city has been crumbling and destroyed and infested with monsters you spoke of a rise of the Age of Heroes and what has happened in the last few months here in Drakon high change change for the better I do not see heroes before me maybe the time will tell and the flame will reveal but now all I see are wretches squabbling over mortal affairs unconcerned with the greater truth it is like you all refused to turn your eyes towards the light and are content to sink in the mud you don't see any heroes and I don't hear any truth so unless you can present me with better people to fix drakon home she's a heretic she's been excommunicated by the hierarch she's just she's mad addled all the way through you could look at her see it whatever that corrupt it's that delirium is doin to her and the rest of them it's totally making their minds go crazy honestly we should run them out of the city well I'm not going to hurt you with you on that one Hayes yeah this is this is the one time I actually I will argue that the queen of thieves has a seat at this table because she has a lot that she can bring this lady Lucretia the chosen one or whatever she is to be I am no chosen one I am NOT a seeker of truth all right this place you may sanctify it again I came to give it my blessing that's I feel like that's a fee Leah's job yeah I think we got it yeah yeah we got the blessings covered we're all full full on blessings Oh philia you she has always looked at truth through shades of south doubt she does not open her eyes she does not let her faith reveal to her the app what she knows to be true she tells you that this Queen is a lost soul but none are beyond redemption and shelter and flame deeds do not make our light but I know what has happened to your queen and I know that she could not save her because that her faith is not strong enough not even the darkest shadow can hold back the true light I don't trust her for a second it is something to think about that we've never really gone to her about I know they're young people go to her but just a wonder like maybe she knows what to do with their yeah maybe she does but I don't I don't want any more people following her that's not the dragon hunting that I want to see man oh philia or sorry Lucretia flame keepers all on the flame keepers Lucretia if you were to see a new dragon hime what would your followers bring to a new drug map just like one of those dating shows yeah contestant number one you know nothing about the sacred stones we carry them with us in our hearts they do not harm us you say that we don't know anything about the sacred stones amethyst Academy got anything to say about that I have these potions here that I've been drinking I have this orb and a lot of other crazy contraptions there's a lot of things going on with this delirium that seems a lot better suited than jamming it into my chest and a hope and for the best indeed what this woman says is utterly ridiculous none have invested more resources and understanding what has happened here than the anima this Academy that falling star you claim as some beacon of light does come beyond the stars but a darkness carries with it ejected me from a realm beyond mortal comprehension as best as we can tell delirium is the raw stuff of magic in physical form nothing less than crystallized chaos a far cry from truth and light there is more to discover to be sure I don't know that sounds like a reasonable logical path wouldn't you say Lord Commander just trying to just trying to create ties create bridges they're walking up and they pushing them towards each other and he the Lord Commander asks aldrick like what what does he think and Eldrick replies suffice to say the amethyst academy has harnessed and developed the means to harness the an incredible energies found in delirium we shall use it to create unfathomable magical wonders on a scale hitherto under m tough for the betterment and protection of all people only the amethyst academy has the knowledge to accomplish such a feat and the wisdom to temper the wild and destructive potential of this volatile resource I think it's dangerous in the hands of people who don't know what they're doing with it but I think it's valuable in the hands of people who do and like the queen of Thieves she smiles and before she can speak though the the night captain Theodore Marshall speaks up and he says Lucretia sorry bad accent Lucretia and her cult poison our very faith with her blasphemy in these sacred stones but the Academy they will sow the seeds of greater destruction we must destroy it we cannot allow it to be used every last single shot of that delirium has to it's got to be destroyed we got to get rid of it we can't allow these secretive mages to be doing whatever crazy experiments they want we can't punish them for the trespass that they've done so far but we can certainly deny them for further spoils to build implements of whatever chaos and destruction that they want to there are abominable arcane ambitions no no bounce and they are reckless with their experiments the amethyst Academy has done a lot of good for this world their improvements in magic them opening up schools for those of us who develop powers them teaching people to control and understand magic the world would be a much darker place without the amethyst academy with their grip on the magical entities that this earth has to offer so the fact that a new magical entity has presented itself I see no better person to handle it well not person no better organization to handle it than the ones who have always handled and always improved this land with their magic the amethyst Academy used to be a staple of Drakon honey and what did they do for jackin hi they taught mages they understood magic they spread magic they used magic to build a city that was beautiful defendable powerful protected they protected the city with magic they helped and it was needed by they helped the royal family yeah they were there they were part of the ecosystem [Music] I don't want I don't want to have my words mistaken however you all speak with this hope of restoring Draganov but everything that we have learned so far this city will never be the beat born again it will be a dead City this is where we disagree yeah this no no no no this is where you are ignorant this is where your hope is blinding you to what needs to be done to control this circumstance this city is dead it is a corpse it is rotting and it is sitting on top of the most chaotic and incredible magical resource the world has ever seen it needs to be contained and studied and controlled and if you are if you want to work with the amethyst academy Lord Commander you need to dispel this childish notion that this will ever be a living City again I think we can find some middle ground here now we are prepared to assist with restoring the monarchy of West tomorrow but you need to understand that there will never be a dragon hime again that's why we're gonna call it new dragon home yeah and it's gonna be built kind of over top of the corpse that you could build it about a hundred miles away maybe but this city will never be a living City again I want to hear what Eldrick thinks about that do you think what else what else I could say oh I thought that was I'm getting confused yeah that was elder elder it wants to so I'll join Oh Eldrick wants to study contain it and basically make this like a giant like quarry for four that we really that's the one skeet me the other ones the silver order want to blow it all up the hooded lanterns want to restore Drakon hime mm-hmm but both of those parties that you just mentioned think that it's a dead husk yep and I guess it's mostly just us that thinks we can it's awesome the hooded lanterns and generally I now I'm kind of realizing I don't generally agree with a hooded Lantern this bowl had an idea that everything is going to be hunky-dory at the end of this for tracking hime commander Lord Commander lord commander we we want the same thing we want dragon hime to be restored but I have to say that when we talk about restored you like it's not gonna be back to the way it was that's impossible but your vision of what dragon home could be in the future is that it's under a head of the monarchy in a living City correct that's what I would have hoped the castle the city it's the crossroads of the entire nation there cannot be a nation without dragon I'm so between having some semblance and I'm not saying all the semblance of what it used to be a monarchy in this place the silver order is saying that there could be a livable place here if we tore it up and put it back down relayed the tracks out I mean if you look at the houses in the certain districts it makes a lot of sense for us to just got it and rebuild but it could take time then there's the problem of the Delirium with the Delirium as we thought you want to study it and in quarantine it but does it have to be the whole city the entire city of Dragan I'm that's quarantined and studied or could we could we split up the the idea of this I turn to Ehlert is there is there a way that we could contain the meteor yeah maybe there will come a time one day when we have extracted the Delirium that is here studied it for many many years and found out its true nature and purpose that we can determine that but it will be years if not longer before we can actually determine what has been done and until then we need to get control of this city mortal Creed is insatiable the outer Ward's of the city are crawling with scavengers you broke the power of all those nulls which was impressive but you've merely ensured that more brave fools will now bend your deeper into the city who knows what horrors are still lurking in here what horrors could get out and at the very least it will be a battleground for prospectors and treasure hunters there's all manner would be mages people that we've that don't work with the Academy that still study magic or people that are just interested in selling it back to us that want to be crawling all over this place there will be no less Anarchy than there was before until we are able to reclaim the tower and project the full power of the amethyst Academy we are willing to do this we can do this we can work together to do this but you must understand that it will mean there is no dragon hime for many many years the very least if at all we cannot promise that we can promise that the ruins will be something Lord Commander that you and your men could scour through we may be able to get access to the castle again find the records of the law the royal family and you may be able to restore the monarchy of West tomorrow something might be possible who knows what magical wonders we may yet build this could be the foundation of something truly wonderful so what you're saying is even though of course we're not expecting it at the snap of a finger but there's potential if we work together with the Animists academy that this place could be a place of prosperity in many years from now maybe not in our lifetime place of prosperity absolutely the world could be a place of prosperity the promise of what the power of Delirium offers us is incredible well we have to start somewhere I'm willing to agree with that sentiment I think that the amethyst Academy and the hooded lanterns and the silver Order all have a place in restoring Drakon high it just feels like sometimes Lord Commander power corrupts sorry I got my access messed up that the night captain says Lord Commander power corrupts if you're gonna let these majors have the carte blanche to do what they will with this delirium it's gonna be a disaster it's only a matter of time before they do something truly awful with it I know it I know it in my heart you don't know what that's an assumption you're assuming you're making wild accusations about the amethyst Academy what does the amethyst Academy ever done to the silver order do you not have a tower in Illyria [Music] our faith our faith still remembers those dark days years ago of the sorcerer kings that kept people in bondage turned people into slaves when we let magic rule the world it makes slaves of everyone that doesn't have a gift of it and it'll only be a matter of time if the amethyst academy has this kind of power yeah now though they'll say they're doing it for the better of everyone but they're only gonna make it a better world for people that are born with the gift of sorcery and magic no this your goodbye well you know what I think's gonna happen night commander I think we need somebody who can can control the magic otherwise it's gonna run rampant and you are blaming the current amethyst Academy for mistakes that you say happened ages ago I'm a spell caster my goal when this is all said and done in a new Drakon hime is to stop the ridicule of young spell casters and give them a place where they can hopefully learn to harness their power and understand and use it to better the world the reason I came back to Drakon hime the reason why I'm here the reason why I'm doing all of this is because I just want to do something good with my powers because I'm sick of people telling me that everything that I touch is an incident is a disaster I I ruin everything so I'm a little sick of that mentality of mages are just gonna destroy everything and only fend for themselves well mecha mater I represent that and I'm here to make that change and I think some of the members of amethyst Academy and I look at River when I say this want to better the world with magic and I think we could aim for that of course we do I'm sorry my friends we Sebastian you you three are good but I don't trust the amethyst Academy I don't and I can't and if you're gonna give them the free rein to do it then I'm sorry but I don't know how we can work together I can't I can't abide that I can't abide the the chance for this to go out of control everything's already out of control if we try to act individually and not work together it's gonna stay out of control regardless if you wanted to burn the city down it's gonna be in their control they're gonna want to call all the shots they're gonna want to just take over the entire situation there they'll take over they will thank you matter you have a bad habit of putting words in other people's mouths I'm starting to see that right now you keep saying things that they're going to do that you're sure that they are going to do meanwhile we have one of the leaders of the amethyst economy or at least the leader of what used to be Dragan Heinz amethyst Academy standing here saying that he plans to do the opposite and I've known this man most of my life he taught me he raised me he is like a second father to me so if you're saying that he and the people he represents are going to do wrong by the city then you were saying that I am going to do wrong by the city although I may not be an active member of the amethyst Academy I am from them I was molded by them and I've done nothing but help you I think as well under the guidance of a true monarch the amethyst Academy would not have this full free reign that you're implying the amethyst Academy has to bow to the people in charge we are prepared to make a deal about that says over I think there was already a deal made was there not I think that there might be a contractual contract obligation saying that you serve the city of Dragon high we're prepared to honor that provided that we in order to do so we will need to retake the Cathy the tower that is on my to-do lists yeah the list it is high on the list actually so if that's all I mean to be honest like we that partnerships already been created and connected we just need to find that your air what if Knight commander we put a monarch back in the throne of Westham are the amethyst Academy there's papers that can be signed there are things that can be done to ensure that they bend the knee to that monarch I don't know what you think a piece of paper is as a shield against a bunch of wizards my commander this whole battle against the Noles was for a piece of paper we did it the power of a piece of paper is incredible and this man right here has just stated that he will honor that why do you deny him you know what if you want to dig your own grave you can be my guest but I don't I'm not gonna have any part of that I'm not gonna have any part of you letting this this wretched corrupt substance uh sure in some kind of new world order the way I see it you got a bunch of mad scientists on one hand and a bunch of crazy Kooks on the other and I think that neither of them know anything that they say that they do about this delirium and it's best destroyed and that is the word of a higher so what you're saying is you will not bow to the new monarchs and their wishes for what this new city could be if they say that the end of this Academy is part of this new dragon home they oh we're subjects of Illyria and soldiers of the Church of the sacred fire we are not her subjects and we are not subjects of Western art we are not citizens I'm telling you for the good of this world and you cannot let them have control over over this and if you're gonna do that then I'm sorry little commander but the next time we see each other we might be on the other side of the battlefield I think if you're not with us to create a better Dragon hime then maybe you need to go back to where you came from where you're building your own city your own place because you will don't have a place here if you're not gonna help build it towards a better Dragon hime and what everybody agrees is a better dragon home not just your own face that blinds you it feels like we're about to draw a line here Knight Commander you're about to choose what side of that line you are on and whereas this side this city used to have are you gonna literally draw a line yeah I'm drawing a line with the end of my spear he draws a line for emphasis on one hand we have the people who want to rebuild a new Dragon I'm not necessarily in this exact location building a new Dragon high means gaining the knowledge of what occurred here understanding the Delirium the connection that it all has researching it I trust nobody more than the people who excel in magic to handle magic I represent a part of that as somebody who uses magic we are going to need a city guard and I commander you have been a trusted friend on the battlefield and off the battlefield you have shown us kindness that not many people have shown us along the way I consider you my friends and it breaks my heart to see my friends making such a terrible transition terrible in your opinion this is a mistake it's a mistake friends don't turn the city over to the amethyst Academy returning you know more trustworthy than her any points to Elena I look at Elena Elena you've been quiet what's your position on all this I love this this is listen you guys are all free to decide whatever you want to do with this kingdom in this city but I'm gonna get my piece first and you can fight over the scraps afterwards what's your piece I must confess before the revered mothers of our fee that my desires are not that pure I am a base woman and I'm only interested in the asking price so don't you worry once I've taken my spoils all you little wolves here can fight over the scraps but speaking of taking some spoils I think you should know a few things first I was hoping well not hoping planning you did some excellent work in recovering this Cathedral and that little trinket that Ofili it has over there that flame keepers phylactery I'd like that and while I'm at it Lord Commander I'd like your badge too and I think it's in your best interests with you give those both to me right now yeah whoa whoa whoa whoa and then I'll be on my way and you guys can work out whatever whatever you want to fight over afterwards that's that's totally fine you you just should know you know before you want to work with the Lord Commander as well did you go through all the paperwork down there in that vault a lot of it a lot of it we skim I mean I would love to go through it with you what should we miss I don't know but um I'm trying you to read you uh you know about all the other Vaughan castles right yeah yeah you know that he's the mad dog that killed half the Vaughan castles during the Civil War say some things but why why would he did you tell them Lord Commander why would you murder the royal family he switched sides when the Kings brothers couldn't agree over who was going to have the crown he fought for one then fought for the other and when they both end up dead now he's here because he's got no other Wars to fight so before you put all your faith in that guy you just might want to think about all the betrayals and the blood he has behind him I would like your seal Lord Commander and miss ophelia you can turn over that as well to me now well we're not gonna do that well no you really should consider my offer I've got a really really tantalizing price it is the bargain of a lifetime in fact it is a lifetime bargain no no I fall to my knees no I think no no no I think the time now to be honest Eldrick Eldrick you know that thing that you gave us a while ago it was in a box and it had a key when we were apprehended by the queen of Thieves she didn't give it back so she has it what we failed at a mission and we were stripped of our personal belongings and we didn't tell me because we thought you'd be mad like you bar right now yeah and she is using it over our head that's why she said that we were working with her it's really not she's more threatening us than anything and has her stuff yeah and the whole he has yet it yes both of the hips technically speaking we never got to test it so we don't know if it works well I am pretty sure works she touches her nose yeah it's a shame I can't be here in person but I figured that this was the safest way to deliver it yeah Elena or whatever your name is I was just about to make a stand for you then you had to go and prove that you are the villain here I mean I'm totally happy to continue our working relationship you three by calling me out today totally proved your capabilities and I'm impressed you betrayed me you called me out you thought you had me Anna's captive you thought yet all control over the situation and not once did it occur to you that maybe you weren't holding all the cards so I'm offering you a deal here and in fact you're not even the ones that are holding the price the onus is on you philia read and You Lord Commander to turn those over to me and then you are all free to go and you can work in whatever disagreements you might have and well I'm here I think I'd also like all the gold in the vault that would be really great you got a little fancy bag don't you that you can shove it in I'll take that too I'll get I'll give that back to you but that would be the best way to get it all out of here no no I do really reconsider well I'll be honest I mean they have a choice I'm going to look at El Zurich and see if his if he's giving the the sign like a as you do the the Lord Commander speaks up I did what I had to do for my nation the lows to neither of them would have made it neither of them would have been the right I did what I had to do for Westham are and I will not turn over but what is she talking about about this why she's got nothing what is she threatening us with she has everything ultra can you explain to the Lord Commander what the box that the queen of thieves took from us my guys gave you that you made no oh man now that's that's that's not gonna go over well oh god I thought we were making such progress Eldrick the health apps it will take a further disaster for you to truly understand the gravity of what has happened here and the potential of delirium and why the Academy is the only ones who can safeguard it as a resource its destructive potential is truly fathomable and the Academy has created several weapons which prove this [Music] that one has fallen out of our control was not unforeseen but under such circumstances it is highly regrettable Lord Commander I don't have any quarrel with you and what you did during the war but you better give this woman that seal or we are all going to die and that's we're gonna take

just hand over the gold and the badges and you all get to live sound like a deal no but what happens if we don't well then you die die how tell me in detail painstaking detail Eldrick would you like to explain what happens well a zone of wild magic is unleashed disrupting all magic in the area and sending a cascading blast of the haze and delirium based magic rapidly expanding through the area leaving a vicious area of lingering magic and deadly arcane energy which causes intermittent pulses of arcane power and very rapidly kills most living creatures in the area I'll trick what effect what that sort of thing have on let's say the garments were wearing or gold that were carrying not much it would have the same effect as if you walked into the crater so the gold in the essentially local it essentially releases the energy that was released in the immediate aftermath of the meteor falling but in a less concussive form it was developed as a means of clearing out enemy fortifications so that they could be reused so if she were to use that weapon on us how does she get the gold in the badges I know and I suppose she does as well she must have an a friend of some kind if she knows this undead creatures can survive in the haze well we know somebody who makes undead don't we what maybe it sticks maybe sticks is gonna come back I was thinking more maybe she's working with Oscar well that would be terrible I have an eye for talent yeah oh man okay well we played our card what do i do Ignatians if we give them how can we give them to you cuz you're not really here no I'm not Elena will bring them to me and you'd best not follow what if we don't allow Elena to go well then you die what if we take Elena with us then you better run as fast as you can because from what I understand about what this device does you have seconds to get out of here before you're dead luckily I can run really fast in a couple of seconds yeah but I can't I can't hold on I can't yeah I don't I don't I don't know I don't know Theo I run too fast I trip they I know you've lived for 15 years as a survivor in this city by being fast and stealthy but I can be stealthy but I can't be very fast and Pluto cannot be either oh but I'm not leaving him behind what didn't we bring you the badges no what if we destroy the badges I'm not giving you terms to negotiate I am telling you what your choice is follow my orders or die okay I think we're out of options here well this isn't up to us this is up to Mayo there's gonna be another way into the castle the Lord Commander there's got to be another way to the gas oh I know there has to be Lord Commander Rory Vale will have plenty of future opportunities to collaborate it's not like you'll never get into the castle she winks she wouldn't say Lord Commander I'm sorry I don't know if there's any other options right now and I don't think we want everybody in this room dead this was never a situation that I imagined us being in this was forced upon us I say she does it we will see the flame and our faith will protect her no one listened to her no one you are not the hostage negotiator I have no fear of what she may do by corrupting those stones with her profane magics I say we execute that one yeah you can have the badges and you can have her we still don't want to turn her into a martyr right we haven't got our destroyer do what you will the castle is of no concern to us we care not for it it is not it is a corpse perching above the city but the truth and the light is already here surrounding us in this whole city Lord Commander I think you have to give your badge flame keeper can you do the ritual without it but there I can try I I will it's not necessary to have this trinket to last this place we don't it's none of our concern what the but you want to do with the castle it's nothing to do with the silver order what you want to do with Western Mar is not our concern we're only care we only care about these holy places and we can't allow this holy place to be defiled by that ravages of that terrible sorcery and the night captain speaks up and of course my point is proven already you want to turn the city over to this amethyst Academy who's going to make weapons like this you think that anybody is gonna be care about any authority of any nation or people when they can make weapons like this you want to give them the keys to the castle the carte blanche to do whatever you want when they can make a weapon like this Lord Commander I don't think we got much of an option with regards to this queen of Thieves I think you got to give it up but I rest my case those may just got no right to do anything in the city they've already they've already made their mistake in fact the matter that they even gave it to these three that wasn't should tell you everything you need to know about where their intention yeah they should have known better to be fair we encouraged a lot of faith in us going into the queen of Thieves lair we didn't expect to almost get eaten by a monster it was I we almost died I know you fought hard but you three the Lord Commander said it there's any other bigger loose cannon around here than you three it's her and she's got all the she's got all the game in this right now yeah that's why that's why she's a problem that's why we have a queen problem we have too many queens in the kitchen it's not saying right we do says Queen Lenore I cannot believe that my city my people are being held hostage by you you are a vile woman so you can all see that there is a problem here I'm wondering if we can put the feuding on hold for a moment and focus on this bigger enemy she's obviously an issue she's obviously got her hands around dragon hime more than any of you realized I think we need to give her the badges but I think this may be a way that before we can reach a better to Rockingham you're right we do need to burn the evil out of the city and I think it starts with getting rid of her and turned to the point to the Queen with ease I'm inclined to agree says the night captain and frankly I think Lord Commander you did what you had to do during a war and I don't I don't like the sounds of what you had to do but I have to say it's clear to me that this queen of thieves is amethyst Academy and and we had a good thing going us the Lord Commander working together doing the right thing let's get them out here let's get those I'm that those mages out of here oh I didn't say that I said the queen of Thieves they're both part of the problem I think we fit wasn't for them meddling around with magic that they should have been she wouldn't have the car that she's holding she's as long as they're in play she's gonna find more ways to manipulate us to find more ways to work around us I think we should give her the badges let her leave and then we'll continue our discussion clear and present is the queen of Thieves although queen of Thieves what's stopping you from just blowing us up after we hand you everything you'll just have to trust me but we don't so now now we're at a checkmate here or stalemate Sammie stalemate play a lot of chess we yeah more of a checkers guy i yeah its stalemate right who know let me put it this way you know you played your cards you lost this round but I like playing with you and maybe we'll see at the gambling table next time hopefully then you have a few more learnt a few more lessons and know how to play your cards a little bit closer to your chests I've never been really good at poker mainly I just if I lose I smash the other person in the face with my bow so yes you may have won this round hmm but let's get on with it no because next time you may not see the hand we're gonna be play Oh philia can we give her the badge for the safety of everyone in this room and those outside of it to a certain radius you do say the only place you care about in the city is this place so you should probably just get ready to comply with this terrorist thank you you see what we've been doing this whole time this what happens commander like every time you try to Pixar our arms just keeps getting twisted and we have to put up with this we don't like to she's may say we're just catching bones we were on a bone collecting mission and then we want bone collectors Drexel says the Queen Lenore give him give her your badge it is not your command it is not the symbol of your command but we will discuss what you did to my family oh yeah we keep crossing over that hmm it seems like it the huntin so P it says Queen Lenore okay and the Lord Commander takes his badge and he throws it on the ground and I feel you read walks out in front of Elena drops the phylactery and walks away and Elena picks them both up and the gold I have all my stuff in this bag you can empty it out I don't need anything else but the gold just go down there you can take those two she points to two of the burlier hood lanterns take those two down there no I'll help I don't think you understand all my stuff is in this bag like yeah well you know if you want to do it privately you can empty it out downstairs hmm I start like reaching in I'm pulling out like bags of gold and jammies man there's like yeah there's like a cat for some reason I don't it's it's alive somehow books and like various potion bottles and scrolls and it takes like a good do you have an organization yeah when you open it up it's always like it's like a shelf and I reach in and I pull what I need off the shelf it takes about 15 minutes of me pulling master foot waiting and like I'm like organizing them I'm like okay this one is for the potion-making this is my reading material hurry out you asked for the bag do you want it for bottles of wine no leave the wine hey I'll give you two all the bottles of wine go back there you go oh wait I'm supposed to go get it guys I can't carry this off I'll help you okay you got it you're able to load up the gold in the bag is this all the gold we found downstairs yeah that we didn't steal it cuz we're holding angle yeah do most of it one for you one for me hmm I go back and I throw her the bag Thanks good job you guys are thank you you were by far my best employees no or not she reaches into the bag pulls out a gold bar and throws one at each of you yes don't spend it all in one place is it in front of everyone yes well I have to keep up appearances and I can't take it but this is really mean I definitely take it there's no way I'm taking this and I slide it in with my stuff how did that get there I'm just like I'm not gonna waste it how much is it it's it's a solid gold bar worth fifty gold pieces and she replies I gonna be on my way and as soon as and I better not be followed and if I am we're going to have a problem okay is that clear yep before she leaves she feels an invisible poke in her eye what was that I was weird must been the church it's fighting back against Iran as Elena's going to go and then she's going to come back and I will release her can you bring my bag back I have a lot of stuff here you said we can trust you or not I'll give it back but next time you have to carry all that stuff now do you need to put some stuff in my backpack I don't even there there's look at this pile of stuff and with that Elena leaves by Elena Sebastian sits on the steps and I just turned to the rest of my say see see what we have to deal with got conniving people crawling over themselves for power in the city based on what they believe in and none of you were working together and she's getting the better of us night commander Lord Commander amethyst Academy and for a small little bit Lucretia and Mathias I don't even know but before we decide who is on what side and who wants what for dragon hime I think we all have a major issue that we need to take care of and that is that we need to get rid of the queen of Thieves it's one thing trying to figure out how all of us fit into this city but with her on the loose it's just too it's too wild it's too risky yeah we if we can come together and deal with her it might be easier to figure out her lies and deception are nothing before the flame Thank You Lucretia say there's something you can wait outside yeah can you wait outside Lucretia we have lost nothing zombies that is of any value she has only taken gold what is gold but corruption what are those symbols are but of a way that has long gone what about my bag is but a trifle all my stuff the bag she your attachment to those material things weighs down your very soul I mean I said I've been telling him for like months it's it's not about what she did in what she took it's about what she embodies and that is pure lies in darkness and if you believed anything that you were saying you would help us defeat her and get rid of her so that way even any light could shine because she's only gonna envelop this place of darkness well I don't know if I'm ever gonna stand on the same Sun are you you speak of deeds and speak of action but your actions and your deeds have no faith and while you have no faith you cannot stand up against the darkness that she represents it is not by your actions that your faith is revealed faith comes first and then when you are a vessel for truth and the flame that is when you will find justice but until then your actions cloud you with darkness you will never defeat her unless you can treat truly give your faith to the light it's not my actions I'm concerned about it's yours and your followers that do nothing nothing to do anything about her darkness her darkness the darkness can do nothing against the light but she is she's doing things she is corrupting those around her she did she can only corrupt those who allow themselves to turn away took from the light and yes well we must resist those who turn them away from the light the true message will be hurt she has not harmed me she has certainly preyed upon my followers those who tried to make the sacred pilgrimage she has stolen sacred stones from us but these are but passing tribulations and the slowing off of our own mortality at her core she is nothing but a shadow and what if she tends to impede the greatest light in the city the crater what if she intends to put out all of the lights all of the Delirium and when she's will fail I think you don't give her enough credit I think you give her too much Lord Commander and Knight Commander you guys willing to help us stomp some evil some true evil I don't think any of us can move forward with this going on she is now that she's gathering the badges she has something in you three you have my hammer but you need to understand that the amethyst Academy is only gonna make this situation worse they're just as bad as she is I'm not gonna have you be blind if you want to be blinded and you don't want to see that there's two snakes coiling around the city and you want to tolerate one just because the other one just bit yeah you got a rip in both ah you got to get rid of them both no I've heard snakes that MIT can make really good pass if you can teach them not to bite I mean quite Sebastian let's not be naive and you should be honest with this man the amethyst Academy will be no one's pet understand yep just trying to help you make an alliance here but sure if you're going to cat I want to make sure certainly night captain the amethyst Academy and the church have had many disagreements many many over the centuries and if there will be anima and if there is animosity from their leader there will be animosity from every single one of them they will not fall in line I don't they never change [Music] somebody has to change somebody has to change or else there will be no change going forward and you all die in this forsaken City I'm will I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt but it doesn't seem like he is willing to extend the same thing to us and I and if he wants to go around destroying the most valuable resource the city has that he we've got nothing to discuss I also think that maybe we should put project explosive delirium on a hold firm I'll just throw that out there like justjust it's so far it's done nothing good for anybody like having the weapons out there seems to have a just the fact that they're around I can't believe you that you don't think that that should be punished alone did that act of even making that kind of weapon can even stand and even hold a candle to anything so do you think that everyone should be punished for every wrongdoing that they do should the commander be punished for all he did during war you know I don't know that yet but I do know one thing weapons like that have no place in this world they can only murder and kill and those kind of things if they're gonna if those are the kind of things that the Sam ah--this Academy does let's be done with them now we don't need them to retake the city we can do it we can commit our resources we can get more support from the hierarchy we can bring more forces in here and we can start burning down the city and take it anew we don't need to take back their tower they're gonna have us doing this whole song and dance going up their tower doing all these things I'm going up that tower and here you are talking about oh they're making weapons and how can we let that happen we're sure the people who Forge the first swords there were people saying why would you do this this is just something to be used for war dwarven artillery and those machines that they can make you use them also you don't have flamethrowers yeah and well and Ophelia speaks up the dwarves they destroyed themselves with their weapons they put flags upon the world with what they did with their arcane science they brought the downfall of their own empire in the days before the first Paladin do you think that it will be any different with this Academy what about you and your flame and fire and the weapons you've created should should you be judged for those for testing the power of the flower they're not nearly on the same order of magnitude no but it's testing and pushing the boundaries is I know what we've always done all of us I feel like we're losing focus on what's important we have a rogue terrorists in a bomb she has a very powerful bomb and she has in her possession many items required by the keepers of the city why we're not putting aside our petty differences and dealing with this we're not gonna have a dragon hime if we keep letting her run rampant that everything everything we want whether we want to scorch it or raze it to the ground or clear it all the monsters whatever we want to do none of that's gonna happen while she's on the loose none of that can happen and before we all look at that problem together then we might as well just leave and go our separate ways and let her just keep running the show I think everybody everybody's efforts are required in order to do it because she is a foe that has power that you didn't see it slipped right under your noses when she was doing it underground and she's gonna continue to do it she's gonna continue to infiltrate your people and bring them towards what she wants to be a tracking hime which is no Queens no kings just thieves running rampant through the streets doing what they want is that what you want to fight against to bring light to bring order and turn the commander you've had problems with her this whole time but you never knew to the extent in which you had this problem there's anything I can say for the move that we made by bringing the light on the queen of Thieves is that now at least everybody in this room is aware of what she's capable of and I hope that that's enough for you to commanders in you Eldrick to just set this disagreement aside for a moment because otherwise we could all die and we could lose a lot more because that bomb does not have alliances well so why are we hanging out in the spot where the bomb was said to be to be honest she could not even have it she just be bluffing like we have just that's the thing we have to we have to break her cycle of power I think if we weren't here then she would blow it up for very valid filter because we kind of keep helping her perpetuate us were under her thumb and we want out from under her thumb we can't do it alone and she had a mole in the hooded lanterns she's been taking people from the silver order and I'm sure she's done something wrong to the amethyst Academy I don't know you guys yeah just got one I mean yeah she stole your bomb she saw your mom give me a bad name and I know that that probably sounds like it was my fault but there was there was a giant monster we were not prepared we were sent in to the queen of thieves lair on a mission without proper knowledge of how people and you have told me that you had that kind of weapon we could have protected it yeah but the amethyst Academy told us not to it was a it was a difficult time we're here now it passed us this is now us let's let's talk about now us all right forget forget that conversation don't worry about it it's fortunately that's the hand that we've been dealt yes I mean don't look at the messengers of the tragedy look at the perpetuators look what's done is done but we got to get those badges back there is one thing that we need to reconcile before we even enter into any consideration of an agreement we are we will work with a silver order but in order for the Academy in order for me to go to the council and present our alliance that we will leverage the assets of the Academy the council needs the assurance that we will have access to the Delirium in Dragon hime if we do not have that assurance you will not have the aid of the amethyst Academy okay two things two things that come up for me there number one I think really it's not our authority to give you that access it is the rightful ruler of Dragon hime to be able to give you that access and number two technically the amethyst Academy already owes their services to that ruler regardless of what you want from the situation or not and I have no no no no no no and you can produce that and Eldrick will correct you and say this paper guarantees the services of the amethyst academy in order to solve a crisis of succession this does not assure the allegiance of the amethyst Academy in retaking the city and it is also furthermore contingent on the amethyst Academy is access to the end lease on the grounds of the Academy of Tower which is currently in the possession of no one really you really we have to go get it ah thus in order for this agreement we can deny valid the city of Dragan Haim must be able to furnish the tower to the Academy and once that is done we will honor the agreement and the payment that has been made and we will aid in the finding of any heirs I mean speaking of heirs long beautiful and that said very distracting the Academy can provide some advance information regarding that search in the good interests of our collaboration how about this but we need the assurance of knowing that we because if not we will go elsewhere we will find others to collaborate with and we will do what we need to do to ensure the supply of delirium and you do realize that by saying that that means the net commanders not going to agree exactly so I mean we won't stop you from getting delirium but we will I don't know how you can let that rest on your conscience I don't know how you can allow them to get their hands on a shred of this with what they can do you know you guys are the worst you are the worst kinds of people we almost just got blown up we did because of a bomb they made yeah and we need to take care of that and nobody's willing to help so I guess it's up to us to save the day again because you and your petty squabbles and your stupid rules can't agree to come together over a reasonable cause wanna make our own faction we are our own faction yeah we're better and we don't we've been trying this whole time to work with all of you without disagree in PSA's we're trying to run that little fine line of everything that you guys want you guys never asked us like if you could help us it's always us helping you it's always what you want what you have to do your rules we've been doing everything Queen Leonora speaks up this is correct you have done fantastic things Lord Commander you have served Drakken hime well but if what you say is true if what that woman said is true that you are responsible for murdering my husband's brothers is it he says yeah and their children yes I did what I had to do for my nation for my crown and for my city Queen Lenore says Elias Drexel you were relieved of a command I nominate him Sebastian Crowe and bayo Sonya for the position and given that the Sebastian Crowe is a former member of the amethyst Academy it seems that the only one who can intend that Bluto Jackson is a foreign national the Caspian they ascend yeah I named you Lord Commander of the hood Atlanta they hope I accept and I like it get down on my knee and take a bow there's no badge to give you I'll get one back ender lady commander whatever you prefer Lord I like Lori Lord Commander yes we have a choice to make will we side with the amethyst Academy or the silver order I think that the amethyst Academy is gonna allow us the better choice in defeating the Queen so be it like captain you and your soldiers are to leave the city I turned to River and I look her in the eye and I say don't you make me regret this it has for you Lucrezia Mathias you grew up here in Drakon hein I know this you and your people may stay for the time being you do not seem to be a threat go I suppose the chat of this flame here will remain dark for now I mean they could light up for the go no just a quick you can leave dragon under the darkness well Lord Commander does the does he's he's sitting down on the steps now and Petra and answer we're kind of consoling him he's got fired he's got fired hard I walk up to him and I say I'm sorry it had to be this way but I still honor your commitment to the city and your guidance in your judgment [Music] let me make it right I'll accept the Queen's judgement as we all should regardless of what time it is our actions still have meaning and value I deserve death for what I did but let me find that death on the battlefield if you're willing to help us fight the the queen of Thieves the false Queen and we'll take all the help we can get Petra handsome you in yeah Meldrick river you with us yes the hooded lanterns the amethyst Academy and the Dragon Force the silver order and the and the followers of the falling fire dispersed from the Cathedral and they turn sorry it had to be this way says the night captain I'm sorry too because you are a valuable friend an ally but I think that the city needs more than just someone who's gonna stay in their own box and not budge breaks my heart to see they see it but I guess we've got a long journey ahead of us - Illyria my commander I hope that we meet again and I hope it's on good terms you were now I hope so - you were a close friend and you still are I'll send you a letter sometime goodbye I'm gonna miss you made our choice yep I'll see are the cards lay after we're done you just got our lane like a mix between like crazy AIDS old maid maybe some blackjack in there and there's a three decks and it's like not quite complete and like the the house rules of euchre so um yeah yeah all right Eldrick says now that they're gone so they do they like file out yeah so can we defuse this bomb there's much that we can do once we have the power of the tower power of the tower tower I have a few things to discuss first Sebastian yeah if you can aid the amethyst academy in reclaiming this tower you will be inducted as a full member of the academy and awarded your circles commiserate with your talent I accept you're gonna go back and get your diploma yeah all that tower means something to me too because my mother used to be a member of that tower she was the Archmage of that tower yeah so going to that tower is the top of my to-do list and I will reclaim it in the name of the Academy very well now we have two issues to discuss first is the affliction with you Queen Lenore and a few other arrangements that require the privacy and discretion of the amethyst Academy and the interests of Dragon hymen seeing now you veil our Lord Commander of the hooded lanterns of Dragon hime and we have the Queen here in their presence your queen is very sick we know that we have a very powerful enemy that we are working against who though she claims to be a thief is not his obviously talented it in magical capacities but she's a nuisance we will find a way around this well we have to move forward so first on the list is to reclaim the tower and then once we reclaim the tower there will be nothing the queen of Thieves can do to deter us because we will leverage the full might of the amethyst academy to securing the city okay then you have the Rangers help to do so in order to make sure that the Queen's stay safe but also the borders of the city stay safe I think we should close the gate for now Pluto what do you think which gate the two gates that we have we control them both I'll be able to with your permission Lord Commander I will help you transition into your command but if you feel the need to operate in the field I will defer to you for command okay I mean I I am gonna be in the field I like a hands-on approach to you know my commandments I understand but I know several people who I trust and I trust you and I trust your children and I think regardless of who has the name in charge I still believe you hold the place at the top of the hooded lanterns assistant commander commander agent Leonora says regardless Lord come out regardless Elias Drexel you will answer for what you did to the Von castles and your role in the Civil War is that understood yes as expected now we also have another issue and I turn to the Academy so about this heir to dragon hime that you need some help with we need to figure out who that is and we have a little piece of paper and we need opening to tell us I don't need to open that piece of paper to tell you who the air - dragon I'm once oh you can see through paper no no really they're signing it I mean I just want to open it cuz I want to open it I just wanna make sure like let me know what's in it but I just I just want to open it it's very clear now that you've been struggling so long slings happened with respect your majesty your memory is not what it used to be is it that is clear you have memories of your children you have memories of their lives you've been asking where they are two of your children were not in Drakon i on the day of the meteor fell they were at the Econo pits academy which one well you must understand the bran castle line is Dragonborn they are mages and roughly half of their bloodline is manifests at a very young age so did both the Kings daughters they cannot inherit what why can't why by the 19th addict of lumen anyone with sorceress power that is a recognized member of the amethyst Academy forfeits all noble title and claim Oh Eldrick did I know did I know them [Music] let's just say that there was an incident a few years ago and they have both gone missing they've both gone missing yes why didn't you tell me cuz otherwise the other ought the only other option for you Sebastian was nullification fair yeah thank you I'll check for uh it was better that you didn't know Katerina and Eliza Vaughn castle as befits their royal station were privately inducted in the amethyst Academy and it was not widely publicized to the members of the Academy that they were members they stayed in which cross with the gentleman named Eric one of the nobles that was from dragon high and they lived there outside the tower proper Eric Eric I believe he was a confidante of the Stuart his house has long been the ones that were associated after this incident occurred both Katharina an Eliza went missing what about Eric oh he's still alive in which cross yeah what does he know you're alive ha I don't know I haven't I only knew him when I was little when I was growing up I he he wasn't around but I was worried that he was in Drakon mind the day the day that the meteor fell but I guess not I mean this is good news no the two the two Eliza and Catarina had been in the city to attend their brother's wedding and they had been brought back to which cross which crossed our only a few days before the meteor fell in the same carriage that Sebastian was brought to which crossing yeah Wow that's that's what I met them but I didn't know hmm I didn't know it's been a long secret but we can say this in confidence now therefore regardless of what the Kings will might say only Leonard von castle was was the only eligible heir to the throne of Dragon Idol unless well if Leonard can't take the throne maybe his son can open the will what do you mean I'm gonna pull out the old the old will and the other documents grab the other documents what though will I wrote it in here the cost is high no it's actually an a the last will of the king of Dragon high then we also have the descendants of the vaughn castle family which actually might illuminate Pluto Jackson his family and his family as will has been sealed magically it can only be opened by those who hold the flame keepers sigil and the stewards sigil oh yeah we're right here and all the stewards is my dad we had the flame keeper well we at least we know where they are or who they're with but it doesn't matter cuz Leonard is regardless but if you look at the family tree there is the posi yeah indeed or the queen says then we must make the arrangements to have my grandson Raj g-dragon hi should he be brought now or should we as he secured his deal with the Queen first he he resides in caspia I don't mean to alarm and any of you says the law but that woman is very canny and [Music] if she knows any of your familial connections do you have family nearby their closest would be Jupiter Jones do you have found my new part anything I mean I'm searching for my family my family's in uh Underwood village why is she gonna do something do you think she might make have you not considered that as a possibility not until this very moment no why would my family be brought into this there you can use them against you oh my gosh he's already using a lot against us to be honest no this is my family no I know but like I mean add that to the list and if she knows about little Jackson's line it's not our judge do you know if she would know would she have any way of knowing is there any way that this could be done I mean she knows a lot of things that we don't know how she gets that information I mean just let's just assume that she does what do I do about my family I have a family maybe they need to go to caspia maybe they need maybe we all just need to go to caspia not all of it they just built a new home yeah maybe they should stay in Pluto's home as guests Pluto [Laughter] well I need to get them out of here we need to set up a new base of operations I mean the cathedral opened now this place will be a ruin we should collect everything of value here and leave it you fought a good fight claiming it I know how many people gave their lives for it but there's nothing here but dust I will reclaim the tower but first I'm going back to Amber Wood village okay I think that would be the best course of action would be for all of us to head back we need to batten down the hatches secured what Holdings we have and then we will discuss the resources that we can commit at this time to securing the tower that must be our next goal once that is done we will be able to activate its defensive powers and we will be able to get some control over the situation okay let's go check on your family first before doing anything and then we'll check the tower off the list the list is growing and stronger maybe smaller and we just need to start checking well goes off I'm impressed with you three so screen the door okay you've done very well my mind is a fire this city is a golden glowing place but it is a almost like a dream now and I find it rather difficult to concentrate for so long do you have more of the medicine do i yeah yeah i brewed a few when we were having downtown yes i'll need some more perhaps then my mind will come back to me maybe the Academy can help figure out I can give them my notes there are you giving her some of that brew that Oscar yarn and conducted concocted it's the best thing we have right now actually we concocted it it may be the best course forward we found ways to stabilize delirium so that we can use it to conduct magic it might very well be that there is hope for her there's hope for you your majesty we'll have to see time will tell that's all we can that's all we can do I uh I go through my large array of things spread across the ground and I pull out one of the potions and I go and hand it to Queen Lenore cool I'm not getting my bag back am i Ludo I need you to carry most of this and it says don't worry I will help any gestures to his guardian thank you I have a lab at the tower I also have a lab we're also have a lab I have a few labs you have a portable lab you have a lab in that that guys basement yeah I think I yeah I've alive labs scattered around the city Tower Sebastian how have your skills developed in the time since you can set things on fire I can better I can control my flames I I killed a lot of Knolls using fire magic I was a little afraid to use fire magic before but yeah things are progressing well it seems to me that if Vale will be the Lord Commander of Dragon Heineman and pollute Oh we'll be acting as Lord regent and that maybe we can see about having you take up your mother's old office you'll have to demonstrate conclusively to the council that your skills are in the right place I can do that I can do that it's not like magic right does that mean that I gotta say hey guys does that mean that I get a say in the way that that the amethyst Academy conducts its work here in Drakon home if you are nominated and confirmed sebastian you must understand that your duty first and foremost will need to be to the academy but given the circumstances it will also mean that you have a duty to track and I am as well and I can do good things for this city perhaps yes and the people and the people in it magic people I can help I'd like that you could be a hero you are a hero it comes with some nice perks as well free wine make the thing like a like a really big buffet Thank You rewards card I can continuous I think a new wand with delirium on the tip yeah add it to your current one yeah my one's pretty cool mmm I like that one well then what is your next what is our next step we reconvene in amberwood village and then we go after the tower very well Lord Commander that sounds good umm Lord Commander does sound good yeah it's a nice ring I'm gonna convene with the Rangers and get them posted and ready to defend the walls of the city I think with the Queen running amuck it's dangerous for people to come in it is we will need to consolidate our position and prepare to head out toward retaking the tower in the weeks to come now how about lunch and a rest and sleep yeah sounds good I could really use a rest an extra bunch leave things off tonight but you guys did level up and what your what your choices are for little and wrap that up there as as you head back with the scattered remnants of the hooded lanterns towards the barracks and a very changed order of power in the city of Dragon Hina as I head back to the barracks I pick up and I'm looking at the hand crossbows trying to pick a real nice one oh yes oh you're you're doing crossbow expert waiting so long so are you taking up another level of rogue and taking crossbow expert I am yes so one more level in rogue crossbow expert so many shots I need to pick new spells and that's probably a decision that's going to take me a while because I might also drop an old one mm-hmm to get a new one do I get level I do get fifth level spells oh no oh no oh no so veo as the new Lord Commander oh gosh under certain circumstances that you deem necessary you may be able to bring hooded lanterns with you in the field well if you do so you gain a special ability once per rest you can use the power of Lord Commander as a bonus action to command up to three hooded lanterns to make an extra attack as their reactions if you choose to bring hooded lanterns into the field with you of course they are finite in number and they are just soldiers but if you do choose to bring them with you you can't cool yeah that's also yeah you can requisition and bring them with you you need to use your discretion when you do so though yeah I'm not gonna kill my whole army in one go then needs to be people at the gate but I have an army cool cool I'm gonna have to choose between animate objects cloud kill synaptic static I mean you could unlearn a spell and take two yes do you learn any new spells and fourth levels in arcane trickster now Pluto Jackson what's happening for you level 9 I become a little bit harder to kill Oh fighters job and a ball roll saving trip my saving throw cool cuz I'm good at failing saving throws so I know that this will come in handy like I'm actually gonna use it a lot nice well one is for us I think I actually got one new spell but it has to be either illusion or charm no enchantment well there we are what are the next steps gonna be the tower I only get to explore the tax a amethyst Academy at all but now it is that you want to discuss now that you have the advantage of privacy between the three of yourselves when we're having our sleepover and we're and we're staring up at the ceiling do we go back to like the tower for a long rest something yeah yeah we found a little spot or in your Hut my tiny house but they honestly like the only the only way I can work with the amethyst Academy is if you're in charge well guess what Pluto you're gonna be in charge of it all for a while listen Pluto what's that listen to this listen to this okay you take up the mantle of Drakon hime right you with me you following so far I'm following on your about your right is the Lord Commander I so strong who rules your armies and who you know is a trustworthy Ally yeah on your left is the person in charge of all of the magical ongoings in Drakon Heim and you know I'm gonna make the right choice where does your allegiance lie you it's always been with you well yeah in this graph it's it's always been with you in the last while we've known each other for like timeframe like six we know long have we been in drag because couple weeks that's it yeah and in those weeks a lot it okay no stretches when you're dealing with playing months but yeah it feels like it's been months I have to go back over the the actual Diaries I know that we did have a couple weeks a couple of times where we had like at least one or two weeks of downtime and there were a few periods were like a few days past yeah and I think what we will do as well is I'll give you guys a couple weeks of downtime that if you want to do things and prepare for your your next steps you will say that here like as with the consolidation of the factions well we'll take like two or three weeks of down time for you guys to prepare to train up get ready for the next things and just like fall into the new order of things can I study the spell book some more in-game yeah how many spells will you give me for a month we'll work out the okay let me know but yeah you would you be able to study your mother's spell book and do some more things I don't any other like organizational things that you guys want to do you have a couple time mage command people no day job yeah no this is gonna be good Pluto hi I know you've only known me I have a bad feeling about this what's the worst that could happen that's the it's no it's not no it's the three of us it's always one the three of us and it always will be all three of us suck I started with the Academy's at amazing focuses we got a deal with the amethyst Academy get the tower back but I have to tell you that I'm worried about their intentions and I always have been and that's why I've been practicing murdering mages for the last yeah but I'm a mage I know but do you trust me I I have to like Batman you have to be able to but man you trust me I have to be able to Batman do you trust me I do do you promise you can't lie I can't but it's just if you're gonna spin around and be like I'm making delirium bombs for everyone just your honor each so with the decision with the Academy I you're right I didn't fully trust either faction but I trust that the Academy will at least be the most beneficial party in helping defeat the Queen because that's what they are willing to do and that's what they saw as an issue they were willing to work with the other faction the other faction was not so they lost that Lord Jackson we are now your your small table your small Council and I will tell your Erlin yes the amethyst Academy unlike Lancelot remind you though that you do have to reclaim the tower and that there will be a process is already writing checks we're gonna build a new tower it's gonna be have a pool on top yeah lettuce we should name it lattice tower I was gonna call it Sebastian keep but no we're naming after your mom I know we'll see we'll see Sebastian keep is also among us the dummy me flex my lord commander we probably have to go clear this you can I wear a crown do you guys have a crown for me you can wear it tier you can wear it tier and/or the god king of the mages I hope it says we don't ever you're not in my tiny Hut property just just as a psychic reminder don't don't don't float mage King any anywhere near and it's bad news there's not a topic to joke about I think Sebastian would understand that yes like that in in the old hit like the ancient history of the world the notion of sorcerer kings and mage Kings was like synonymous with tyranny and so that's yeah so like the amethyst Academy is actually really careful to avoid that one things that was mentioned tonight was like the the edicts of lumen which were basically in agreement 300 years ago between the Academy and the church and several the nations the world basically laid out like the laws under which the Academy this Academy would be allowed to operate and wanted like that notion that a mage cannot inherit like any sort of rulership or throne was a really key element of that no well Pluto hmm you will be the Lord of Drakon home so he gets a crown that honey you should see me in a crown and I think that's where we're gonna end for the night yeah a big thank you to our cast Kelly Jill and Joe for playing and of course as always Kelly yep oh yeah hi we're on the script I don't even have a script up what am I talking about Oh No okay cool oh yeah and a huge thank
