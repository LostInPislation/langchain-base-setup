city filled with crazy magic and funny quirky and awesome characters and I know you do because you're watching our show it's really worth checking out the first few episodes on the dimension 20 youtube channel it's a wonderful example of just how far you can adapt the rules of D&D 5e into a modern magical setting and I've really been inspired and a little intimidated by just how good Brennan

if you'd like to save 50% off your subscription with that let's return to the ruins [Music] Drakken dimers no more struck by the funny story the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway condom its rival factions struggling to rule the rubble 3 unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon Heim our heroes stand in the ground floor of the shattered Tower of the amethyst Academy this great and imposing structure looming large over the ruins at over 700 feet tall has been a beacon and a symbol of the destruction of the city for as the heart of the amethyst Academy's former power in Drakon Heim a piece of the ancient meteor that crashed through dragon high and broke off and shattered through the tower yet the top remains floating in place in defiance of gravity our heroes have come to this ancient tower at the behest of the amethyst Academy here to reclaim it so that it can be used as once again as the staging ground and sanctum of the Academy's power in Drakon Heim you are in the ground level of this ancient tower from the outside it is an imposing monolith again over 700 feet tall made of a material that isn't obsidian isn't glass isn't stone or metal but has the shimmer and Sheen of all three and yet now that you stand inside the tower proper you can see outside as if the walls were just made of glass from the inside there are great bay windows that open up yowzer completely painless windows that open up into the city giving you the view of the campus grounds and the gardens in the lake outside and you can see the pillars that hold up the tower so each tower level and there's internal walls which are solid but beyond that you can see raid outs like a one-way mirror you are in what is this Lobby level arranged with what was once a great fountain from which a tree floated that has now crashed down in the center whatever gravity held it in place now gone several sitting areas tables and chairs are arranged and a great desk at the center of the space in front of four large doorways that are arranged in a hallway opposite at the end of the room these doorways two of them are burst open overflowing with rubble another the doors slide open and closed banging against each other erratically and a third the double doors are closed these are doors made of metal elsewhere on this ground floor to the west and east sides there are sets of spiral staircases leading both up and down it's just occurred to me that the amethyst Academy did not decide to give us blueprints or a general map of this building they really did not equip us for this but you've been to these before so you know your way around I spent ooh one that I went to school they're all pretty different right they're all pretty different they are vastly different hmm I recognize maybe a symbol oh I remember that from school I forgot what it means I have three things written down in my notes here secure basement find staff of power override Nexus that's all I've got we ready for this know that door looks concerning which one the big one is opens and closes once in a while you can hear this crackle of electric energy and this clap of thunder that reverberates down and actually whenever when it goes off you can feel the shake through the rest of the building that's not a good sense probably some sort of torture device you know I don't think please the person in the in Victor head in the door way and it crackles that with energy and it just in it I'm saving that for later like we could use that that's like probably like that's like a very intimidating lobby audition but respect to the Clocktower yeah yeah we could take that I'm gonna excavate this door for the Glock there is a staircase going up and down or our first mission is to secure the basement because if the basement gives us the that's where the teleportation Circle yes I think and if I know anything about magic doorways are you saying we should try these doorways I mean no just the teleportation circle there were stairs leading down correct there are there are sets of so the these four doorways are arranged at the north end of the of this level and the room kind of wraps around the doorways in a sea sort of shape it's a very large and open plaza so the whole expanse on this level is this big open room that's about a hundred and fifty feet by 150 feet going the full extent of the ground level of the tower and then it wraps around in the C shape around where this hallway flanked by these doors so there's a set of two on one side and a set of two on the other side and then surrounding them is a fountain where this tree has collapsed down mmm and then on the east and west side there is a set of spiral stairs that are protruding from the wall and you realize when you look at them the protrusion of the staircase isn't something that is reflected on the external architecture of the building where I went to school all the buildings are kind of yeah it's I get lost you know when you're like it's your first day at school and you're like trying to figure out where your classes are and you're like 10 minutes late to every class was that your whole school that was my holes like I was never on time to a class and apparently everybody else was so it was just me it was it was hard man there were staircases that went to places staircases to place I don't even know where he was called from your youth Sebastian the halls of the amethyst Academy in which cross which was more of a castle than a tower were filled with wings that were completely empty much like this top tower it is larger than the number of people that would live and work in it and so it is entirely possible that there are sections of this tower that were abandoned even before the building was destroyed by the meteor we're hit by the meteor rather guys I don't think my navigation skills are gonna be as much use in here that's okay what do you when you smell what do you wear does your stomach say it it's kind of just grumbling right now it's not really giving me a just a general girl girl well speaking of things in effect you're all still under the effects of aqua exper go so you have a resistance to radiant damage and you ignore saving throws that you make against delirium in the haze but please mark down how many times you do this I will tell you and please write down how many saves you have to make and as well the telepathic bond between yourselves and eldritch is still in effect as well oh yeah oh sorry elder use him Eldrick yeah where should we be going first what am I looking at right now I can't see through your eyes so you'll have to tell me what you're seeing and I'll do my best we're in the lobby we've made it into the lobby from what I know and what my colleagues can tell me the levels below you the basement levels contain the teleportation chambers the summoning chambers and the morgue the levels above immediately should at first contain the great halls the apprentices chambers and then the workshops lecture halls and classrooms starting on the third level you will find the library the library here extends the entire length of the tower up to the Nexus and we gotta go the entire height of the tower so they really focused on the library indeed the library itself is about half the tower all the way up and the other half is building his classrooms lecture halls and in many cases several abandoned let levels from what I found there were about 80 apprentices here before when the tower was struck and about 30 or more on full guild majors that were here what should our first move be I leave that up to you you we do absolutely need to secure the teleportation chambers the Nexus and the staff of power they're all of equal importance however what you may be able to find as well if you can the tower itself is warded against external scrying and teleportation magic so and I expect that it is also gone erratic so as a warning if you have any abilities or powers or spells of teleportation do not use them to try to traverse between the floors or you might end up in the abattoir is that like a fancy cabinet or what's what's an abattoir most Academy towers this one included have an abattoir that is used to guard against extra planar incursion oh so like a jail for teleportation exactly I don't want to go there no cape no as long as no understand you may be able to use tell you can use teleportation magic as long as you can see your target but if you use it to exit the tower or teleport between floors it may trigger that defense so be warned in addition go where you know but if you have the staff of power you will be able to control these defenses in addition there are scrying orbs throughout the tower that do allow those within the tower to observe other locations within it if you can find one of these you may be able to survey the area a little bit more safely do you know how to use this Sebastian I can figure it out figure it out as we go yeah I mean it's a circle like I figured out my orb is another orb yours is a light orb it's kind of heavy so dance downstairs do you want to try it I mean if he's saying that the teleportation circle is key and we're right here you know there's only one floor down the only differences is like he said if without the staff of power the teleportation circle is from what I understand not usable until we figure out the wards it also couldn't want to set the Eldar yeah I would yeah cuz I feel like we're yeah Eldrick if we secure this teleportation circle can anyone use it can you guys use it right away or does this magic not interfere you will need to investigate whether or not it is safe to use it at all the last time that we tried to teleport anyone here they were we never heard from them again when I can only assume that they were killed it also might be beneficial for us to first find one of these orbs so that we can then that's scry on the location of the basement and maybe see what the situation is down there before we head down there or if you think they would give the staff or if we have the staff it might make it a little bit easier to control indeed you also may find that there are rooms and areas of the tower that are keyed to their original occupants it may be easiest to get up the tower through the library since that the library itself unfortunately would have been caught in the destruction and if memory serves it is a many teared room it might be open to this destruction above so we need to find a scrying orb the staff power activate the Nexus secure the basement to a basement last you guys what yeah let's try to get let's go up up up let's get this tower back online and that way we can hopefully spy on the basement see the situation mm-hmm and then head down there and secure that and once all that's done maybe in a good place yeah I think so so I guess we're in exploring mode then I have a question for Eldrick I'm in the lobby and nice fountain feature but this one door keeps jamming closed and it's there's like electricity I don't know if you can can you hear our you know it's loud it's just alter it gets really loud and distracting and it looks like some sort of torture device it's a there's like doors and they open and close what do you know what this sounds like noise banging yeah yeah it looks really scary is it in the center of the room yes well those are the elevators what those are the elevators come again the Academy tower has four in addition to the library reaching up the entire tower we don't have to take the stairs there's several shafts chimneys in the tower that conjure a platform of force that will lift you between the floors to a double purpose if I received one this is unique to this tower well you called it an elevator it is called an elevator so innovative cuz it elevates you it's an elevating experience do we want to scarily go in the big banging door or do we want to just take the stairs there's four of them two of them are are busted up you said two of them have rubble two of them are filled with rubble one of them's banging and the other one is the doors are closed guys we could try to take the elevator I mean it seems a little scary though yeah in a giant Tower full of random magic you non-magic folk let's take the stairs let's not use the magic force elevator no I love magic magic Oh guys if you're gonna put me in a box to go up go up I mean they all can climb beside if you're more comfortable taking the stairs then I mean it it does help if we kind of I guess we're looking for a few things so we do need to explore a bit stairs so maybe the stairs allow us to go floor by floor and check things out yeah like that I like that idea it's good that we know they're here but once we're at the top I'm taking one of these things down or or or if I mean if if there's a window or something we can always feather fall down we have options good magic one way or Magic another you guys want to head upstairs thank you all Rick I'm just saying it might be thrilling to just fall off the building i'ma start a business in the city gets you know up and running yeah you're already planning here yeah we gotta get the tourism up a bit yeah so foot traffic would you like to investigate these elevators further or would you like to check out the stairs don't I check if they're working just so we know it's like at least an option I approach the one set of doors that looks intact okay right beside between the sets of doors are in a in a niche in the wall there are a set of metal levers besides and one lever is beside each pair of doors so there's again there's four of them total down a hallway that's about thirty feet wide each of the doors are opposite each other and made of metal and there are these pull levers beside each one I grab the lever next to the door what possess it like down there up I pull it down pull it down and then it releases and as you pull it down the metal doors slide open with a kind of hiss and as they do you see what I saw there is a rush of air that comes whooshing out and quite suddenly this box of glowing blue force forms in the chimney and as it forms these glowing arcane runes appear on the wall of the of the box of force that say first one says el the next one says two the next one says three the next one says four five six seven and then a little bit of text appears beside each some of it is a little bit garbled and you can see that the list is trying to go further down but it stops and start and Jarls up and then you just see this the letter E is repeated over and over and over and over again as the list continues that's probably where broke yeah like the tower is busted up yeah so probably can't go that far like maybe we could just go up to the yeah the toppest part the highest part but we also need to fight we don't know that the staff of powers at the top we don't know where the scrying or there's no reason why to go right now but what we could use at the top you know that big gap we never like how we're gonna get that gap that could be but there's a ladder as the words flattered by the word L it says Lobby and then in beside two it says great halls beside the three it says lectures reading rooms library entrance beside four it says library stacks beside five it says workshops beside 6 says apprentices workshops and besides seven it says apprentices apartments so where do you think we do want to start on to work our way up are we taking the stairs or this box I'll take the box the box the box box could be anything it's a globe I know much you wonder one of the I'm gonna I'm gonna dip my head in and kind of poke it with my spear or my solid the the glowing magical force it's like this blue force it's almost it's translucent but it's solid as long as gonna have to get in the depth one guys what's the worst that could happen and I you're standing in the bodice I come into the bomber I come into the box and I trust the Academy you would never put me in any danger with their magic he gave us a bomb honking an elevator and I press to you go to press the two and your finger goes right through the words and nothing happens capture like say something what was what was the second floor what does it say next to it granny you recover from that though cuz we're all trying to look impressed I set my hand goes through it and I go this is part of it great hall please nothing happens oh this usually works it's it looks like it's an illusion that your hand is just going right through is there any sound coming from the elevator second floor please there's the rushing of wind and when you look up it looks like this elevator actually stops at the seventh or you can see that the ceiling is in place rather than broken away so it either doesn't go all the way up the tower or it stops floor - please try your magic use your mage and I hit mage hand push this maid hand pushes it I just magicked my way you don't have to tell me Pluto I was testing and I don't have a good excuse I should use my image and it would have been so impressive the but you see mine it's invisible bars of force appear and trap you inside look she realizes that your your this is a forced cage I panic I panic that you're now inside and the doors in front of you close oh God and this smooth jazz begins to please as the elevator softly rises as not-so-young as to rise up and it raises up about 30 maybe 40 feet before coming to another pair of metal doors that's slide open and the bars fade away and there's this audible and I jump out oh man I take the same caution as I entered to exit like I'm just like checking I walk out just normal and I'm just like you guys that was like it easily could have been as far as I know like a box that you just walk in and it murders you yeah as far as I know that's what the major they give us bombs and stuff there's it's totally plausible like I don't think my fears are unfounded no I thought there was a good chance we could have died just gas that's filling in it's like oh cool and then Oscars just laughing at us like I don't want to fall for that all right so I step out onto the second floor so you step out into a short hallway that is almost identical to the one that you just came out of yeah sweet once again the opposite you is the malfunctioning elevator that's crackling with lightning on the other two that are collapsed and filled with rubble the door is broken out and there is another water fountain in front of you this one instead of having the tree coming out over it it is just a fountain a font of water and you can see that the there are several gargoyles that are all facing inwards and the water is coming out of various orifices in the gargoyles one from its ear one is like spitting it out of its nose the other it's spitting it's out of its mouth and the other it's kind of the water is coming out of the gargoyles but and the this but it is a font of fresh cool water and then as you look to the south the hall opens into a massive hillard Great Hall which is arranged with the four rows of long tables made of blackened marble and there are several benches and stools all around you could probably see over a hundred people and this Hall and then it comes up to a set of steps where there is a large majestic table carved of black and white marble that has 12 high back chairs along it as well there is at the other end that it goes all the way to where the walls are and there are several massive murals on the wall between very thin windows and each of the murals depicts a mage holding the ident an identical staff and you look up across them and there are seven of these murals hung up along the walls and one of them is unmistakeably Lenin Eventide ah and she she is standing holding the staff like over her head like this with her spell looking her other hand and in this depiction she has been depicted with these kind of flier fairing like wings coming out of her back all of the other mages that are depicted on these murals are in otherwise of like stenches garb one of the the mages is wearing a suit of gold and red plate male and he has this mask over his face and this and has all of these orbs of blue glowing power coming from his hands and feet the others are similarily garbed in completely ostentatious regalia and each of them there's the staff of power this black staff with that holds in it what can unquestionably be an orb of delirium it is very clearly this purple orb that is in the staff but this is like these are also like before Lenin even like yes it looks like it looks like there is there was one other woman that came after Lenin's she is she is this elderly looking human woman that bears the staff and she is wearing this blue blue and purple robes with kind of these luminescent gems floating around her head this is the second time that this has come up at delirium existed before the meteor yeah this is freaking me out a little bit wonder if the Academy knows anything about that beyond the rest of the hallways are several doors several great doors that and you can smell in the air this spicy aroma like something is cooking food and as you go into into the janitor all of a sudden there is this procession that comes out out of one of the doors and it's several buckets and mops and brooms that come out one of the doors and begin cleaning the hallway on their own Wow empty Eldrick we're in the cleaning broom Hall on the second floor we're looking at the paintings of all of the past mages who ran this facility question delirium before the meteor what do you know delirium before the meteor the staff of power seems to have an orb of what looks like delirium and all of these paintings that I'm looking at here but this dates back look probably hundreds and hundreds of years it must be a coincidence we've never had delirium before this is the first time I've ran into something that hinted at this but very well there's more the bible is the color of the amethyst academy we've used purple orbs and various implements and all of our equipment for generations okay if we if I honestly ask myself am I looking at a purple orb or am I looking at delirium like am I am I on the fence about it okay but it but it has the same one it is an artistic rendering but it is very uncanny it's like why and there's more than one right guess well no one we see at two to two of them are carrying orbs it looks like the the staff of power depicted looks like that orb that Sebastian has has been fixed into the head of the staff okay okay so I smell smells you smells now follow that follow that smell one of the other doors opens out opens up and a bunch of floating plates of food on it and they come out of the doors and begin setting themselves on the tables and all the cutlery walks out from there as well and jumps up onto the table and sets itself down and the the food includes like fresh legs of mutton beef fresh vegetables there are then there's some clinking wine glasses that come out with a flying tanker that flies out and it has what these wooden wings carved into it and it flies and it starts pouring and it starts setting this table for like 80 people okay yeah I'm one of the tankards idle I'm literally on the table like yes literally like it's a while here this is great join this Academy long time poison no she's just eating our George I I'm like I'm like sniffing the tankard and I look over and you're just on the table shuffling I feel very comfortable now eating some fruit we're one team it's okay what do you taste amazing better than the palace mmm mmm in fact it tastes so good that you think you might have trouble stopping oh my gosh put the tankard back down and I back away and I just wait I'm eating I'm I felt Mayo's like my there's the tester I could cheese I don't want another situation where all three of us so it's coming out from a certain area it's coming out and you can see the doors open up and you can see behind the doors there is a kitchen there and the kitchen has this stove in this fireplace and this cauldron that are cooking themselves are you changing towers the Lord Commander cuz I'm I'm I'm here I'm not leaving as it's coming out the door I'm literally like piling things into my arms and eating it just keeps coming as you as you sit down and as you finish one thing they they bring out like a soup and another course Sebastian open up your bag of folding I actually am walking towards like the kitchen where this is being prepared and I start looking around at all the ingredients I'm looking does anything seem suspicious other than the obvious magical mists of this all you go inside the kitchen and in the kitchen are several brooms that are cleaning up and there is all these pots and pans and pieces of cutlery and knives that are going into a pantry beside and there'll be like two forks that are pushing out like a potato or or a bunch of or just all of a sudden this penis Hadj of meat flies out of the pantry and a knife cuts it up in the air and puts it into the oven and the stove and it cooks over over it and it pulls itself off the food pulls itself off the spit and falls onto a plate and the plate picks up and levitates through the air and then is set down on the tape doesn't get very part of our past the door because I'm literally waiting for it I'm like flying food but there's there's nothing here that seems like dangerous making our College ACK I mean just watch out for the don't ruin this 24 you walk into the pantry and the pantry is immaculately organized it's huge it's like a walk-in pantry and as the cupboards of the pantry open they open up and this food spills out and then when the door is closed and they open again different food is inside I and the food rolls out and is prepared and as you do so you feel something bump into you and you realize this spell is conjuring a hero's feast and it's being prepared by unseen servants I grabbed a piece of meat suddenly one it's amazing join us Sebastian I look back and you're doing that pleat a lie eyes open uh-huh it's good food maybe the last time we ate well was like with your family so like enjoy yourself too you know let the guard down this is way better than Nura you know new mom's cooking sorry like I know I hate mages but if this is mages we're gonna be okay everything's gonna be okay I think I'm so cautious right now I don't know I go when I sit next to Pluto and I just very calmly eat a little bit of the food okay you can all roll a d20 you were just waiting for that words yeah come on the water's great oh my god okay we got I got a 14 I got a 15 I got a one okay Sebastian why and our passes as you Gorge yourselves on food and all of you gain the benefits of the heroes feast spell which means that you are cured of all diseases and poison you regain all your hit points you can take the benefits of a short rest if you would like to and you are now immune to poison and being frightened and you make wisdom saving throws with advantage in addition what each of you your hit point maximum increases by 15 like temp or just no it's a racist it's a raw increase to your high point maximum by 15 1 500 straws the meal comes to an end the brooms and the buckets come out and start clearing all because it's set a feast for 80 people and well the the brooms and the rags all like start inching their way out and they start cleaning off they cook off the table and as you hiss at them one of the brooms like shakes itself at you and one of them two of the and two of the rags start wrapping themselves around the dirty plate and trying to pull it up your make a hole big I was serious about that let it go felt like the plate just like it and seeing that you're pulling away several of the brooms start grouping up together and they kind of form a line of battle and begin stepping towards you aggressively and these buckets jump up forward and the table kind of begins to wrangle a little bit as well as the animated objects I'll react negatively to being so aggressively kept from their duty sorry I'm sorry it's time for us to back out of this room Wow I've been doing something else yeah we just mean we're only on this this exper geo stuff for certain amount of time we just wasted luan our horn when a car yeah oh and now it's gonna and they're gonna be cool and as they as the brooms start moving towards you the stove starts walking out of the kitchen and it's crashing forward and they look really aggressive well these look like Aang this is some angry furniture right away we're good here we were thank you so much that was delicious when's the next meal time I start saying thank you in under common elvish in common and I just repeat like thank you so much okay make a persuasion check come on the stove seems fat satisfied with your thanks but the brooms are not happy about the situation the the stove meanders back to the words the kitchen but the brooms are going to want one of the brooms flies forward and tries to smack you in the face Sebastian and it gets a fifteen against your AC the broom flies at you and it's it smashing towards the face and you block it with the shield shield spell and then the other brooms begin to move in roll for initiative man are we and now I hate mages again oh there we go there you go I'm not mad about it what do you got 17 17 22 22 7 okay so the brooms are all flying towards you there's about eight of them Sebastian your first to act what are you gonna do there's eight brutes and I don't have the great hall set up so we're just gonna keep it in our minds I'm going to how are they all like close together yeah all right I'm going to shoot web at all of the brooms okay as they come towards me I go no wait stop and I throw out a web that just sticks to all of the brooms as you cast the web spell the portrait the painting of your mother comes to life and casts counterspell and you hear her voice ring out and say no magic in the Great Hall brute-force Pluto I need you to smash something I don't know I start backing away I just I just back a lot Dale you're up do we are we running away or are we actually gonna fight these brooms I'm like are they worth the effort well I are the brooms like coming after us or are they after like dirt or debris on the floor that we're standing on that's a very good question because that's what I want to look at I'm looking at the ground like I want to try to find a peace offering like kicking but it looks like the getting enemy is over yeah and the brooms are trying to clean up then I I guess my turn I use minor illusion to make can I make a pile of like food and dirt on the ground as you cast minor like the Archmage of the in the red armor animates in the portrait and says no casting in the Great Hall and car smells reminder cool feline agility and just kind of booted towards the stairs like backed up to the door and you just run past me and I'm like squeezing out the door or the wait is is it just open the most of the space is open but there are the the spiral staircases from the lower floors are seen on the opposite side I like squeezing towards the staircase will be any good against these but trying to do their job rooms fly forward towards Sebastian and pollute oh and both of you get broomstick pollute oh I get the highest attack against again get against you as an 18 as my racers are like blunting me but it's not doing anything like they're just a bunch of brooms hitting me and Sebastian I get a seven and eight and a critical so they're bouncing off of me as well and I'm like this isn't so and then why can't seem like right and he gets you in the eye why aren't you wearing your goggles and you take 15 points of blood I just imagine actually the broom flies I get instead of going for your leg your eye or your face it gets you right in the gut you're in are you in the elevator weird I guess I don't know where the stairs are so towards the Great Hall has the kitchen rooms yeah and the storerooms it's flanked on either side of that but then there's a hallway going to the stairs on either side well I went towards the stairs he's going to go to the east or the west Oh West okay I pick up the downed Sebastian and I'm just gonna one-arm carry him and I say something like we should have tipped better thank you for the meal goodbye and then I run after via Hong Kong Hong Kong you're always sweeping me off my feet see what I did there okay do they pursue the brooms as you you run off the brews appear to start to go back to their their their business and as you run down the hallway I mention you back on your feet like a yeah I'm scary or something once you catch your breath like you're out of energy I just wasted on trying to stop Bruges I don't want to know what the rest of this tower is like that's gonna be an issue the Bruges pull pull themselves off and go back to their work as you vacate the Great Hall say holy macaroni those are some angry cleaning utensils whoa yeah they were not happy is this like was this anything like your other experience you know they had cleaning brooms but usually we didn't have people trying to eat more than their share okay brainy people I was after us when she refused to let go of the plates so yes I am blaming damned if I'm gonna refuse to let go of a plate it's coz I can run away from them they're gonna work out there that's like a broom to the to the chest it hurt all right we can save our broom bickering for later we need to be defined because we wasted an hour yeah we blew an hour just the eating is stuffing her face I might be mad about it later when we get off this exposure so yeah let's uh third floor anyone that was all that was on that floor right beyond the Great Hall itself essentially the other rooms there were kitchens and pantries and the other storerooms but that room in that level is entirely the Great Hall it seems okay there were some other rooms that you didn't open up that were off to the off to the sides what it was down them perhaps more to serve the Great Hall or private dining rooms or otherwise especially women we get this place up and running again every night I'm gonna be here for dinner just so you know open invitation required from the amethyst Academy they did not tell me that this was part of the bargain or could be part of the bargain I'll see I'll see about getting one of these one of them installed in your car like five five you only need one unseen servant and a lot of heroes faced you'll be okay you can perfect it can create enough meals for like six people as we kind of figure out what van way to go I mean I think we what are we looking for first we're looking for the staff of power are we looking for staff of power the what's the other way if we come across a scrying horrible we'll see what so where do you think from what we saw in the elevator might be a great place to start library third locker third floor was the library yes yeah yeah yeah third floor let's go up to the third floor Scott we'll work off our meal by going up the stairs it will take this did any of you happen to take leftovers with you did you not put anything in your bag no I ain't my fill oh no I had what was he like in my hands I guess I had like a chicken bone but I assumed he would stuff the bag as I was stuffing my face I don't mess with magical food but you probably have a few things on you yeah I was just letting on I may have stuffed a few you know broccolis and you know like carrots and wanted to take the you took the West Esther's oh ok upstairs so you take the spiral stairs up and actually this is where the spiral staircase terminates so they go up what they round out but then the spiral staircase ends here okay and you come on to a you are now in a long stone hallway it is of the same construction as before the kind of this obsidian metal kind of material in the hallways with a black and white checkerboard floor and the ceilings are arched up and there are orbs of dancing lights and candles illuminating down the entire hallway you have arrived right up over here on the board and the in front of you the hallway continues down for about 60 feet before veering off into what looks like a t-intersection you can see the the glimpse of rubble and what might be a statue further down the hallway and there are three doors that lead out of this hallway here that are on on this hallway all of them are made of blackened wood and set with metal and all of them have these large and ostentatious brass handles do we just start checking rooms yeah I would well I guess yeah like I mean I do this what we were done to on the second floor you didn't get attacked by cutlery well we we should yeah look for that orb I go up to the closest door and I press my ear against it to listen up okay give me a perception check perception or the black days no mm-hmm it's it's wrong to me too many times 14 its muffled but you can hear what sounds like music and speaking coming from the other side guys there might be somebody in this room that's for real somebody talking she ignatius a Ganesha is if there's someone in there wouldn't he know he demands the truth he doesn't know all but we can demand the truth from him do you know if there's someone in there no I'm gonna turn is Sebastian lying to me talk about what I just want to use Ignatius also guys indoor telepathy sorry um now they've heard us is somebody in that room we'll just yelled Ignatius oh we have to yell Ignatius just part of it well since we've already announced our presence why don't you just kick down the door and yell Ignatius yeah yeah I'll do it again but more for Flair it's it's on like I'm turning it on but I'm gonna yell it again for Flair so I kicked the door and I go no yes yeah the door flies off of its engines you come into a large room that is raked so the the floor of this room is slanted downward towards the opposite end of the room the north end of the room and in this room are several rows of benches and seats as they as it rakes down and stairs leading down between them beside you as you enter the room is this large throne with which has an upholstered pillar and then beside it is this on the throne itself is this very strange-looking helmet that has a pair of goggles built into it and all of these crystals coming off of it and a tube connecting it back to them and then opposite you you can see that they're on the opposite end of the room there is this large circular glimmering image and above the throne there is this strange box that has the glowing flame behind it and this mirror on the other end of it and it is going through this tube and the light is a beam that comes in it hits this shimmering field and it's forming an image and you can see that there is in the chair on the helmet there is this dust and remnant and a bit of bone fragments and pieces of a skull and the image itself on the screen is saying so it begins in this very elderly sort of voice and there's a little bit of music in this imagery and saying the fundamentals of the physics of magic begin with elementary equations math is fun and you'll learn today's students how it's done close the door obstacle and it goes on and then it kind of clicks and stops and there's this screeching noise and then it starts again as if it can't quite get through the the whole thing it's cooled dust and bone fragments on the throne on the you as excited to put on that helmet as you were moment so yeah I'm holding the helmet and I look down and see the bones and I'm like is anybody gonna put this helmet on or are we now know it sounds like a bad eye we already wasted an hour on food yeah there's gonna be so many more shiny things that we want to toy with and here to carry around while your bag okay so I can I like not put the helmet on but just like try to look through the goggles a little bit like kind of hold the helmet and like you know you can look and it looks like there might be some very small needles on the inside of the helmet oh oh this looks like a bad idea what kind of school is this this is your school learning into your mind I don't remember a helmet that put things in my do I slowly close the door on your way out I start to walk down the hallway to the opposite door there's Harry bailed out I'm I'm intrigued into the helmet but I'm also intrigued as to the last user of the ailment and I have a funny feeling Pluto I feel like we have an experiment sit on the throne hey you serious probably not that's Oscar would want you to do it well then I can't do it yeah no don't sit on the throne okay cuz I'll do peer pressure stuff if you guys tell me I really like you guys we're gonna save our peer pressure for other dangerous situations Oh me I had a test subject what about like a shadow dog no no that's my pet yeah but animals are used for no would you put me in to share what they need all I reach into my fuzzy bag and I pull out we're experimenting give us a second and I want to see then ape which is perfect as soon as it appears I look the helmet on it there is a jolt through the ape and it seems fine and then the image on the screen changes and it shows an eighth eating a banana No how does the ape look I'm it loving and it's it's the ape itself and he's kind of like he looks very focused and kind of catatonic and you see on the screen the this image that is forming of the ape eating a banana and going about its daily life some guy just having fun but the actual ape it's in the chair I'm testing it seems it's kind of unresponsive I'm gonna call Eldrick on me apes are live but fine he's fine the footage moves and the ape then runs into partner and begins copulating and then there's some defecation and it gets really really gross really really fast okay I take the helmet off and the ape is fine well bring me up with us we now have an apron as you take the helmet off the image goes dark and the box overhead that was projecting the image turns off yeah I totally use this on our enemies to get in their minds interrogation yeah Oscar oh man we find him in here went into that yeah save that for later mark it on that do we have a map are we drawing a map yeah oh I like third floor first room interrogation rooms got it it's now our interrogation room all right okay that was a successful experiment that was a yeah we're on board come along monkey you'll be useful yeah we're gonna put you in so many things I'm so I feel so bad I'm not lying you know I don't name it wise I could be just make it harder when Bubba he's like he's like Fay don't worry it's like when you pull something out of the bag it just like it's not like it's not real right yeah I mean from my understanding of magic which is like one out of a million yeah it's not real cuz it was in a bag a minute ago it doesn't make sense none of this makes sense come on let's go eat more magic food my trust has gone down a little bit a little bit well ladies roll a d20 oh gosh nineteen thirteen eighteen okay what's it given the circumstances we need to figure out what things in this tower do and I'm not gonna use one of us to figure that out do we need to have Bridger Eldrick told us not to looking around is there an order I guess we could just ask al Jack although he didn't know what the there's orbs of light that illuminate the room but but any orbs that stand out from that like that are not obvious like though those appear to be the torch II like kind of like no the this this room beyond is a raid much like an auditorium or a theater with all the seating facing towards the glimmering image and the throne facing it is as well the other set of the you can see that the other door that was down the hallway also led into this room okay we just found a room with a throne a weird helmet with goggles and a tube and a image on a wall does that sound normal ah yes that's the projector Oh probably could have asked you before I snapped a monkey into a chair that's horrifying you should never do that again the amethyst Academy does not support animal testing we use fiends and summoned Undead for us okay second question when you pull an animal out of a bag is it is it a real animal you know Sebastian magical philosophy really is in my field I'm just gonna let this one go and we're not gonna use the monkey anymore all I can tell you is that machine that you have found is perfectly safe it projects the Willing thoughts of the wearer onto the image it's a form of the major image spell and it's used for instructional purposes so that our higher-level instructors and our higher-level apprentices can see visual aids in the classroom we're trying to be forward-thinking and it's the classroom of the future but today I'm learning so much here no I'm just gonna ask you yeah we really kind of roll the dice with some of these scenarios literally don't I don't feel happy about the choices I've made but I think my ape was more than willing and he is a loyal companion I only known him for a few minutes because I pulled him out of a but he had a good time yeah and he's gonna be very helpful going forward want to go to the room across I listen into this room I mean now that we've just kind of announced ourselves I yell Ignatius okay I mean this room is a large workshop there are several tape clattering tables with all a range of metal parts bits of armor pieces of wood and many different tools from saws and drills and there's every niche in the room has every sort of various tool of construction that would be here and in the center of the room there is this large pedestal upon which is a wooden body about twelve feet tall and pieces of armor look like we're being riveted to it to form a creature that resembles the Guardian that Eldrick had and the pieces of it are all disassembled and there's a this softly humming machine in the corner of the room that is humming and there are cables coming from the machine and are connected to the temple of the construct being created and the platform that it is laying on guys my curiosity is killing me in this place I just want to try what if it attacks whatever test what if it what if it wants to defend this place what if it wants to defend us because we're its new master you always go the negative yeah I know but that I'm I'm down with that thinking but in magic world it sounds like we need to have the staff of power to kind of command some anything to this like I'm totally down with that gosh I totally pause but right now like we're not even able to you can't even some of your basic spells without being yeah they yelled at me when I tried to cast it was funny I saw that feel like caution over curiosity you that's never happened in my whole life except that one time when we met fake mom yeah and she tried to kill us yeah I'm gonna ask the ape to stand in the hallway and let us know with ape noises if anyone comes or anything weird happens okay so no too touching this machine let's just check the rest of the room or the other rooms like we unless there's anything that stands out again we're writing for an orb or the staff of power right Orbis crying staff the power I get easily distracted it's understand if there's so many cool things in here it's very interesting this is a well appointed workshop and to search through everything here would take some time do you want to spend the time looking through it what about like a surface level just like look at the tops of the tables give me a quick investigation check yech we can't go too deep because we're on a time line right and you can each roll a d6 please 20 okay look around at what this construct is very complete the parts arrayed on the table actually looking at it what you're looking at is not a construct that is being built but one that is being taken apart and there are several and you can see as you look around on the surface that there are bits that there are several notebooks screwing across the floor and looking at one of the notebooks it's the students notes on building a guardian and it seems like the the notes trail off at the end and it looks like they were having a class on how these things are built by taking one apart I failed that class is it reminiscent of like the ones we've seen with river and Eldrick like is it look is it in that same sort of design categories yes it is very much similar to the constructs that Elgar can River have with them so like yeah okay yeah what did you guys get on your teeth down your d6 rules one six-one okay alrighty all of you can make perception checks with disadvantage does my monkey help because but he's in the hallway so I I don't know in the context 12 I rolled to seventh yeah seven you said perception seven twelve thirteen okay so as you are about there I'm gonna place yourselves all in the room and looking around thank you as close to the construct as possible but I'm right right right up I'm you're hugging him I'm I'm poking him I'm definitely keeping my distance is this one of the things that River has as you look around through the room 13 was the highest perception 13 okay okay you look around through the room and find nothing else other than the notes and the tools and other pieces around here as I say we head to another room yeah it's good idea I start to make my way towards the door goodbye let's go down the hallway to there's a there's a split yeah there's a tea coming up you come to this tea intersection that leads to the south and then once again to the east at the intersection you can immediately see that here is the room where the elevators are and there is a large statue of Archmage Madara the last Archmage of the amethyst academy here in this room and there are two more door there are aside from the elevators the hallway continues way across to the east and there are two more doors as well as you come around the corner you come to this intersection which way are you to go I have a quick thought guys yeah let me know what you think remember your mom's sanctum yeah and putting stuff on statues was like a magic thing yeah and she was once the Archmage of this what if like touching statues is also your thing do you want to do you want to put your cape on this statue well maybe we could do it to your mom statue if we find it right but or well the statue might be replaced every time and there's a new head mask or like even just checking out the statute like maybe there's some interactivity with it that may just know about I'm just throwing that out there cuz I I just had that thought I cautiously after Pluto suggests it I kind of look it over like okay and I cautiously approach the statue and kind of look about it okay as you do so as you come around the corner there is a low growl and a hiss as the door in front of you bursts open and a creature leaps out at you Sebastian roll for initiative and you are all surprised what you monster 15 just walking by doors I feel slightly responsible for saying their own exit sorry huh what do you got 15 921 okay Sebastian the door opens and you get a brief glimpse at the horrifying creature beyond there are two of them and as the door pushes open it actually Clips you as if the creature on the other side was lying in wait for for you and the door battered batters you open and you can see the two creatures beyond are covered in tattered robes of the amethyst Academy and as one of them lunges towards you you can see its face has shifted its features for where its jaw should be has become a massive eyeball its nose is on the top of its head and its eye sockets are just two mouths that are patterning and speaking as if they're trying to mutter the remnants of spells the creature behind it is similarly emaciated but its entire face is just eyes all over it and the two of them burst forward to towards you so pollute oh you are first in the initial order you are surprised but that surprises now ended neck now these creatures the door from the projector room bursts open and two of them rush forward and leap back what and another to come out from the corners of the hallway who lying in wait as they do so the first to attack Sebastian it reaches into him with its claws getting a 15 a 20 hit a caste shield to block one of them the other one causes six points of damage the other with all of the eyes gazes towards you and as you do so you can see that there are pieces of delirium crystals growing out of its spine and this purple light shines out from all of its eyes towards you make a constitution saving throw please seventeen you succeed but you still take eight points of necrotic damage you can see these creatures their limbs are extended and emaciated and spines of delirium crystal grow out their backs these two that have come down the hallways one its head is just laying there limply forward and instead this giant eyeball has come out of the top of its head like as if it has no neck its its head it's just laying limply around its chest and this giant eye is looking around with a purple iris the one the one beside it has a completely normal human jaw and face but just one massive eye that is fused together the other two like that are similar to appearance their skin is emaciated in blackened and again the spines of delirium grow out of them to rush up behind and both attack veil there one gets a fourteen and one gets a a seventeen one hits one hits and the other makes its claw attacks getting to seventeen yes so three hits total as they claw into you dealing a grand total of eight points eight points and four points so twenty points of damage the other two that are come down the hallway the massive eye creature it flares with this glow and Pluto to Constitution saving throws oh baby oh no nine and nine okay so now is going to be twenty points of necrotic damage oh wow this withering rotting delirium infested gaze or rips through your body ah okay now can I turn around because I've now gained my reaction to swing out one of the ones that do ya just with ignatius so I'm gonna Sentinel attack getting a twenty to hit that hits for [Music] fourteen regular damage and nine fire damage okay it is bloodied by that attack what BAM nice day oh and Sebastian are both surprised by this sax so Pluto we go back to you so I I turn around as I get like festered with necrotic energy and I go ape protect Sebastian because veo is probably fine the ape is nowhere to be seen what probably he's not loyal because we strapped him in that chair couldn't be I just I take another swing at the one beside me getting a 22 to hit that is a hit 24 sorry for boom oh my god 12 fire and 16 regular okay you slice him in half authorizing the wound and the two halves of whatever remained of this creature collapsed onto the ground with a one last-gasp of a whale okay then is the other ones based with me or still like base with both me and bay oh yes okay [Music] i'ma gonna swing at it 2:22 hit that is a hit or 10 regular and 10 fire damage cool the flashing blade slices through it carving a deep gash but it continues to lunge forward as if ignorant of its wounds and I'm gonna use the trippin attack okay so strength save DC natural one that's perfect it's gonna take an extra two damage okay and it's bloody and it's prone and I'm gonna run away from it okay towards Sebastian and I mean I guess it can make a yeah with this advantage throw an attack on me it closet you as you rush away but it misses and I'm just gonna run right into sebat like run right beside Sebastian and slam into the closest one with my shield okay knock it away getting a 12 and it gets a 17 oh man Tyrell really bad okay you block the doorway but it continues to come forward okay okay next up are the apprentices the last one it's curries to its feet and the and these two and veo you are attacked by two of them as they leap to as the first to leap towards you the first one lowers it's rotting gaze at you make a constitution saving throw 13 you succeed but you still take two points or two chronic damage the other two come at you with their claws ripping into you with their Flex of delirium underneath them they get in your skin getting a 13 and a 17 two hits 17 hits and a 13 and a 14 hit No okay so wow you lucked out so you did today my points of slashing damage so these two come come at you and it leaps to your feet but you're able to elegantly dodge and weave through the attacks but one claw rakes down through you on the other hand these two in the front one attacks at Pluto getting a 10 and a 13 to hit myths and the other attacks Sebastian getting a 14 and an eight it one of them hits so I imagine there's this doorway and pollute ohs trying to block it and the two of them were just reaching for with their claws over the shield did I hit with that one of them scratches me Sebastian for seven points of slashing damage and I swing elegantly at it for like a 28 to hit oh my god for 14 regular damage and an 8 fire damage that also leaves it bloody so I'm like stabbing through the doorway back at them they oh it is your turn so I'm gonna use my bonus action to disengage using my cunning action okay and just to make sure my first turn because it was surprising can't use made right ambush or actually correct okay so I'm going to then go 30 feet or at least as far as I can go turn around and hit this main guy with my longbow cool uh 24 that is a hit nice 23 damage and that was the one that Pluto had not knocked for oh okay so it is bloodied and then I take my second shot at it 13 that is a Miss it just reflects off the wall behind it with a thud I got 25 feet yeah yeah I'm gonna take my other five hit of and go behind the corner okay nice Sebastian it's your turn alright I I swing around to face this group over here and I am going to just try to buy us some time dealing with the two in the doorway so I'm actually gonna use my wand and do a cone of fear kind of like over here over my shoulder oh cool okay so I have to make wisdom saving throws yes nice okay you just like as I'm fighting these things - you're all of them fail you're shooting magic over my right awesome so they become frightened of me for one minute a keening cone of fear terrifies the the mutated creatures and they are it's just a cone of fear does it force them to well it's written in this way it must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you okay it also can't take reactions okay great nice so that should tie them up so we can deal with the two in the doorway and then we'll worry about the others they begin howling at least the ones that have mouths yeah oh I am writing out in and just they're just spouting gibberish as as one of them like reaches over in claws me and I kind of swing it like back to back with Pluto and pull out my wand and I'm like I'm your nightmare now and I blast them with nice who's afraid of who yeah okay and with that Sebastian's turn is over we go back to pollute oh and I'm just a swinging away at this doorway and I get a 17 for 11 regular damage and for fire damage okay and that was for the same one yep he's still kicking the guy so then I'm gonna use a no yeah I'm gonna keep going then I get an 18 - hit it brutal 410 regular and 5 fire not anymore though so as you push back into the room it kind of reaches towards you and imagine the first attack you cut off its arm and then follow through and slice across its throat and heading it completely and as it falls to the ground the eyes will land on the ground just pop and then I slam my shield into the one beside it for a 15 15 I get a 13 so I'm gonna not get backwards okay and then I'm I think I can throw 5 feet you slam it backwards into one of these obsidian desks that is in this lecture in this classroom basically and it slams backward and then I'm gonna step into the no no I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of can I move another character with now that you use your actions in bonus action oh so then I'm just gonna keep myself there because I want to really put myself in the way of this hallway okay the hallway I think is this is a good position we have a cool we now go to the apprentices these three howl in terror and the the lot of them run one of the runs back down the stairs here and it runs down the stairs and on other two run back down the other hallway and just pass me the minis and then I can check to see if any of them make same occurrence okay yes not just like the gnomes that got away so they run they scramble away almost dropping down onto all fours and screaming down the hallway of the other one though it pushes itself off the desk lunges towards polute oh hello and gets a 20 and a 22 to hit so they both had and it basically pushes itself off the desk and jumps at you and basically goes right for you and I've had saying it's like strip off your armor and snow it does so and you take ten points of slashing damage get off me Dale you're up I whip out my crossbow and I take a couple shots at him cool 14 that is a miss it actually bounces off of Pluto's shoulder armor natural one and that one hits me in the back 20 the 20 hits as it's coming up around polluters shoulder and about to bite him in the shoulder it hits him right in the eye yeah how many Isis yeah this is the one that's the two eyes fused together okay and because this is the one that has the eye for the jaw oh just try to like bite you at these mouth eyes could you remove eyes off me I can use my sneak attack as Pluto's right there look nice [Music] twenty-four damage the eyeball on its chin bursts in in a spray blood and something indescribably black John's in my mouth it's on somebody and the creature just slumps over over foligno shoulders guys gotta stay out of the splash so ten feet away at all that I'm smart smart hockey I throw its lifeless body of off the shield with the shield gross hockey can and no do baseball so many sports you can the only sound that continues down the hallway are the reverberating some maddening screams of the fleeing creatures and you can hear their heavy footsteps resounding down line and we'll never have to worry about them again that's where we're gonna take our break oh and we are back we have finished our short rest and are ready to take on the rest of the tower but before we get into that I want to give a shudder it's a tabletop audio for all the great music that you're hearing we've been using it

spreading the news at brennan lee mulligan and a team of veteran college humor comedians are back for season three of their D&D live play series the unsleeping City it is a really cool D&D live play the episodes are so funny and the team there really brings this magical dimension of New York City to life and I love how they've adapted it actually surprised me that was fifth edition Dungeons &

with that let's return the ruins so screams echo down the hallways of the amethyst Academy by as the maddened and mutated apprentices flee from the wand of fear what will you do well that's a problem for future Sebastian um how long does it last you know it's a great question like like just so we can have maybe a timer and I I frantically look around for my ape one minute oh so you should probably start hustling through these rooms to see if there's anything here I say we start to make our way up because the exposure is gonna you know we need to go to a level that's above the haze before we do it or we might be a bit screwed yeah how is the haze doing in the tower the haze at these levels is everywhere and you can even see in the rubble that has collapsed through there are flecks and fragments of delirium in it it looks like in the rubble that is collected down the shafts there are pieces of the meteor in that and there are several shards and pieces of delirium so a thin mist does hang through the halls it is not what the deep haze in the tower but it is a it is infused with the haze itself would this be on par with what we experienced when we were just wandering the city yeah I guess so at this level we're yeah because I'm thinking we would be okay to vacate our systems of one thinking is we should go back down and go to places that we can't go because do we have other x-bow Virgil do we even have anymore like once this wears off can we be in deep AZ this was the the area surrounding the tower is in the deep haze but once you were in the tower itself the tower itself is not covered in debates oh okay yeah because I was just thinking like if we only have it we should use it while we can but now I'm with veo and like we're inside that find a corner to well cuddle tiny head that you can make because I'm sure we could all use a short rest yeah so while I'm trying to get the tiny Hut up that's going to take me about 10 minutes so I need both of you guys to stand guard and make sure those screaming monsters don't come back mm-hmm maybe they're afraid of us permanently so you said there are fragments of delirium around here as well yeah in collected in the elevator shaft where the rebel has gone from you can spy that there are pieces of delirium in parts of the meteoric iron that have come down the rebel and pieces of the building itself I want to spend while you're doing the 10 minutes Pluto do you want to keep guard while I start to collect some stuff so I'm gonna come over to this fountain over here and start creating a tiny Hut okay I'm going to be listening for those screaming apprentices okay standing on guard and I'm gonna head through the rebel ignatius I'm a sift through the rubble and see if I can find whatever I can and that time you can all roll me at d6 three five one okay you're welcome a few minutes pass and the screams subside they stop beautiful so Sebastian is about halfway through summoning the tiny Hut guys that could be a good thing or a bad thing keep going with the tiny Hut okay I'm gonna keep keep summoning this thing I'd like holding out my mom's spell book and like reading poorly some incantations and trying my best to that make this tiny Hut appear cool and no ape right heaps gone wherever that thing went who knows how many fragments and meteoric or the meteor car is in large chunks though that would take a few people to carry out but you are able to find five shards of delirium five shards yeah shards we should probably give this to the end of this Academy at some point I've got a decent amount of delirium in my bag right now and the meteors are they they help physically big are they they're large chunks ranging the that are the size of like rubble oh so like pretty big okay so we might have to go that's like pieces that you could break off but it but you'd need to carry back a lot of it to make anything out of it mmm I'm just wondering if getting enough for your bag of holding might be at least a couple pieces maybe your dad can make some sort of like I don't know knuckles I'm still reading from the book I just tossed you the bag of holding to see I take what I can little what are you doing during this time I'm still on guard okay give me a perception check receive a twenty five okay a Sebastian continues to in can't you can see in the pile of rubble down the down the hall to the east you see a large eyeball the hope and then duck back underneath the rubble they Oh Sebastian there's an eye there's an I let him go I let him know that we know that he's there we know you're there I yell into the hallway I see you and then I go yet there's definitely an eyeball come on out we just want to talk it's one of the creatures from before it slowly crawls out and over the rubble towards you very carefully whatever has happened to this woman has twisted her face beyond all recognition this is the one where her the her I just fused into a single gigantic eye and the jaw underneath so you can barely see her face and as she comes forward crawling on all fours and with her her robes all around her she tries she tries to speak and the only word that comes out is invaders intruders should be here two options we could kill her we could put her in the machine that projects her brain onto the screen I think there's more than two options well I really like that second one I'm going to sheath ignatius it was kind of like a and I want to try to like does it although she's saying mean intruder things does it look like she's just gonna lunge at me at any moment or is it more of a she's just toward you with her hands and that's when you see that there are one of her hands has five rings on it especially sure you're right I want to take one one and as she she reaches it she's Guardians be here and she looks at you and she looks back in at your face and make a charisma saving throw - - well I guess I can ooh could I use indomitable huh scribe actually I misspoke you haven't used in Douma because it's actually a deception check oh yeah so you it's a charisma deception check so unless you're preparing deception I am NOT okay it as you do so we're just block in eyes she says back to you shouldn't be here pollute Oh Jackson I am famous I'm still reading the book but I cut my hand with like my mom's ring on it and I'm like I'm a ring holder she I'm VIP VIP glances over and she eyes the ring yep and she lets her gaze fall upon Sebastian and Sebastian you feel like this eyes are trying to cast the spell is trying to enter your mind you can make a deception check twenty cool is a check actually 23-story and do i do i notice it happened but do i know that she's in my head yeah and you feel this she's like she and she says you're not student expelled Sebastian expelled I'm being allowed back in sir I'm busy here you're you're distracting me he's alumni he's alumni she looks over and she tries to pry into your mind again 24 she gets a five and says no way see spell is that spell I can't I can't I can't do you like tea I'm approaching and I'm hearing this the little thing how close are we you're within 20 feet of each other she's come into the room hey what are you doing hearing this time I'm watching her interact with you and I can hear what she's saying to Sebastian right I kind of get disgusted a little bit like she she's not right and I take out my bow and I go to shoot her okay like I'm approaching cautiously like a wild animal yeah okay I'm like are you gonna be overt or covert about that um I feel like I would just be very direct about it okay yeah it's a cruel nice 414 the oh wait one mmm 15 15 yes okay that hits oh yes limit Matt's got some information girl damage and how closer is Pluto leave it was like he's only he's a few feet away I'm slowly like he's close enough like the attack would not apply no okay like a cautious like a wild animal I can't approaching okay yeah I got a hundred nineteen the bold land soundly in her eye and she drops to the ground dad as Cluedo ask her if she wants teeth I don't think she'll be wanting tea maybe some biscuits but I'll take those actually if there are biscuits I'm going to check the body as I had eyes as I don't know that this has happened she has the tattered rows of the Academy and on her hand or five rings I take all of the Rings it's like a monkey's paw but with rings I don't know what a monkey's paw is I take all the Rings I I notice it's gone quiet and I like when it's over and I'm just oh God and they keep going make the tiny Hut yeah you you just keep doing your thing you were making friends oh no she was trying to do some weird mind tricks yeah with the five rings I'm gonna come up to veio and while he's cats and show her do you have five rings these so the other body one two three four long round I've rings the other bodies of the nautics looking at them they the others have to one of them has three rings hmm I mean they're quite skilled that one's more skilled than river do I finish casting that yeah I want to quickly ask all Rick something sure we could have asked her questions we could have gained you tell us to what happened to her and her people I was gonna throw more scaring scared guys running around here if you really want to capture someone but we were making progress with that one I don't know about that I think most people in this building are pretty far gone dropping a monkey into a chair bad human that's slightly deformed slightly deformed okay if in this tower my eyes fuse together you're dying are you just gonna shoot you gonna good shot by then hmm are you gonna try to take over my mind if you're still sanely yourself the note taking over your mind right now you're not taking over my mind we I think get off this channel something yeah a scale Raquel Erick Elric I need to ask I'll work one thing that I think might come up with the Rings what are you said something about some doorways or passages are gonna be locked by to the apprentice or the thing what is the key is it rings the there are many different ways that things will be keyed in the tower some rooms will be keyed to their original owners because they will have personally done so others may allow access depending on the rank of whoever moves through it generally you can expect that any of the private chamber such as the apartments will likely be locked with spells and those spells will only permit those who were living there to enter an access of course aside from the Archmage once you have the staff power you'll be able to override any such locks that is the privilege of the Archmage however there are certain areas of the tower that are only admitted to those of measure at rank typically guild mages and guild add ups those who wear three or five rings are the only ones for instance for instance you would need to wear five rings to have access to the teleportation and summoning chambers the those access points would be open to you if you wore if I if you wore five rings but just because you're wearing five rings doesn't mean that they'll recognize you as a member you would need someone that was alive wearing their rings in order to open those doorways does my mother's ring count but I'm wearing it seems like in this case it it seems like we're fortunate that your ring is being considered one that works even though you have not been formally given it perhaps it was meant for you by our mother in any case though it's not as simple as just killing somebody or finding a corpse and putting on their rings if it was that easy would not be a very good secure system you would need someone who is still alive with their ring we both look up to you it's a shame that we didn't have anybody that was starting to become friendly with us it was worth five rate okay that that though I will disagree with she wasn't or whatever was I'm just coming my friend we were making progress in us I offer tea I was waiting for an answer I thought maybe we could sit down and well it couldn't answer because it was dead by that point after trying to pierce your mind do you guys want to go puke in a fountain yeah I'll make us some tea thank you so everybody comes into the tiny huts okay now we're gonna pee and we're kind of biggering about like killing this thing and like we're just casually like well what if it they took over your mind and told your secret no what if I knew about mine and then she just she deserved summer I imagine that like when I found out that she was dead it wasn't like an Irish super upset it was more just like a fail I just loved killing so I made it around the fountain and so I assume the role she's in your hangout I also picture us two as we're talking just one of us just starts throwing she like press a digitate like a really bad smell to help us out yeah I can okay so yeah ruining the family forever ruining the feast that we just all had what are the effects well all of you need to make three constitution savings Oh God what's the DC they're escalating so you need to make them one at the top one your first one this is 18 18 16 23 you're all good for the first one second one 21 25:26 okay one more no ten 1624 there you do gain one level of exhaustion from all the vomiting the rest of you have purged it all out and you the resistance to radiant damage is all gone interestingly enough it seems like this fountain has some sort of drain to it because it just carries away all the waste in refuse oh that's actually really nice yeah and I can I kind of like take some nice fresh water it's okay yes is it the same like arrangement of gargoyles no this one actually has a different pattern around it and instead of being an arrangement of gargoyles is an arrangement of various essentially it fires Jets of water out in different patterns that the results of the Jets of water as they go up in the air show the symbols of the different schools of magic hmm I take a scoop of the water and I've written and I'm using it too like a rinse my mouth out mm-hmm can you press a digit 8 now let my mouth taste fine are there any side effects are drinking awkward delirium on an empty stomach so you're the potions guy I knocked back an awkward delirium we're all 80 for one so you gain 2 levels where the spouse who I'm also are we are we in a short press F yes would be a short rest and remember the hero's fee spell increases your hit point maximum by 15 so you can you can raise your hit points above if you need to spend hit dice cool as the tiny Hut fades out what will you do next I guess we're gonna keep its flooring yeah keep so you're here on the elevator level in the elevator room directly across from your two doors leading into another large classroom that you only just looked inside but it was a large class that had several shelves all arranged with all manner of arcane tomes and vials and there were several books and Scrolls on all the tables out in front of you that would be a good place to start we as a the room that we were just fighting in and like can you think of a place that there might be a like when I think of a scrying or somewhere I can see other places I feel like it would be with some sort of like head like a teacher or some sort of like like where would their quarters be the thing is like this layout is entirely different yeah I know I keep asking you just more for like I mean yes it would probably be like a teacher's quarters but where the teachers quarters are or where like maybe they keep on on this level just like in a special room we could like just quick check the rooms yes do it I'm sure it's like obvious that it's there right I would I would I would think that a strong orb would be pretty opulent to be do you guys want to just do like a quick glance around this room yeah it's good yeah okay we do like a surface level cool make an investigation check ten yeah the scrolls and spell books that are on these desks are real and functional trolls and spell books they are several several of them are spell books containing various wizard spells upwards of 3rd and 4th level and there are several spell scrolls in here as well more Scrolls that I'll add to my pile this girls that I never use this girls do you have Sebastian you can roll a d6 one okay so there are two spell scrolls that you can find several of the other ones are in terrible condition and roll me a d20 and a t12 the d20 gets a 10 mm-hmm and the d12 gets a 10 okay you find a spell scroll of cone of cold and a spell scroll of lightning bolt hmm it's using me yeah those are those are gonna come in handy I think I found one like one month ago I've just been holding on to it in case there's a good opportunity for a lightning bolt just instead of spell swallowing okay so much sex I never thought of using the scrolls instead of a spell consumable things learn to use the resources that you find it frustrating when you're at the test and you didn't do any studying I also have potions that I've never used where it's like you're studying for an exam and you're really stressed out about it and your friends like you do remember that you're allowed to bring a cheat sheet in the exam you're like what frantically filling I have a potion of water breathing in here yeah well don't use it now don't use it no okay beyond that there is a large lectern with a book that contains spells up where the swords were and Wizards spells upwards of fourth level written in it and also a very very dry lecture on the history of the dispel magic spell for the spell book how do you that does the spell book have any obvious sort of inscription for an owner it it does the spell book was is open and there's a little bit of dust and ash around it several of the pages of it are also torn out by like clawed hands and the the owner of the spell book seems to have been a guild adept who was teaching here that war and her name was I'm reading up on my Scrolls her name was Larissa and she was a guild a depth of the amethyst Academy and apparently a one of their prayed horrors which are one of the teachers of the at the Academy and do we know any of the rankings like how many rings and add up toward where that would be a question for elder accept your homie gluto quick question what's the ranking system with rings and mages so in the Academy your capacity your rings and your rank are roughly correspond the Academy would allow mage at ups and masters to teach courses a master is anyone that where's Five Rings is considered a master in the amethyst Academy okay and the rank of grand master is and membership on the council is granted to those who wear seven rings and the rank of Archmage is bestowed upon anyone capable of wearing nine rings so what does that make your mom my mom wore ten rings she did I mean I guess you could you could wear more rings writing your arc is okay to wear it's a higher right profession there have been spells of great and epic terrible power to those that master them they are granted the rank of prime and rib primal Rupa thus they are not they do stand amongst the highest esteem within the amethyst Academy hmm and someday I could wear ten rings then everything will burn those who wear five rings are acknowledges masters of the Academy and typically are our instructors and preceptors so master the this master perceptor here would have been one of our lecturers and teachers not all masters are preceptors they don't all teach and you said that Sebastian was at fifth level correct Sebastian has demonstrated the craft with magic commiserate with the rank of master like a master Sebastian I mean Master Sebastian that's right yes some rings typically however one would be expected to be a member in good standing for approximately 10 years before they were granted that ring unless weeks can we expedite this you can't see me but I'm winking okay it's like one of those granny the Pilar you putting on those rings he mind it II mind it I I definitely put those rings on okay they start burning your flesh did they burn right away this is just part of the process eight points of fire dad smashing those rings look really nicely I take the ring off and I throw it I'm like don't give me your stupid rings flute out look we should sell them to someone you're gonna be fine I mean no--don't something everyone just leave them here I'll hold on to them for now okay just case you wanna burn it yeah I will save them for the queen of Thieves okay so we've learned a lot about how the you just can't wear other one other Majors rings uh-huh yeah apparently mm-hmm we can you just have to fight through it he's gonna be tough with wonder if I warrant long enough if the burning would stop and then I would absorb the power of the ring you know yeah try this ring on no probably not no do you guys want to keep exploring it lets rooms yeah all right um I say we go east the rubble east and the way the thing came from doing it otherwise of the East right down the hall way back up now to the east yeah cause it we saw it like around here yeah over the rubble okay well kind of go that way sure take a turn before we you know go up anywhere [Music] so looking for more doors yeah going further down past the rebel as you head to the east the hallway breaks again regressives - in three directions one to the north that then curves around to another door broom and then it heads to the south where it breaks off into two smaller doors and then it also continues to the east again where you can see the stairs going down and another doorway so there are the stairs the door beside the stairs the two doors to the south as well as the passage that continues to the south and to the north there is another hallway with the door at the end of it lots of potential here I say we hit up this door to the north yeah just to close off this corner yeah to finish that up so I don't have to backtrack that's good yeah I pull out my sword I I like the word EGNOS yas and I kick the door down okay you kick the door down and before you is a large chamber about 40 feet 540 feet and there is a long table enough to seat about eight people here and there is a pile of scrolls and books and the whole room is covered in several large stacks of bookshelves but most notably there are several boards here that are made of a white shiny material that are put up against the walls and there are mathematical and arcane formulas written in them and there are several sticks with multicolored ends on them they look like wands that are all scattered about the floor by these boards I walk into the room and I pick up one of these wands mm-hmm and I start trying to use it to channel magic and as you point it out a burst of energy comes out of it and goes towards the board on the wall and the word magic channel magic appears on the wall in what looks like your own handwriting mm-hmm I want to try I go up to one of the other ones can I take it and I write Bayeux is the coolest and it appears on the board I want to do it with a most crude drawing of a cat with a smiley face and sunglasses and I picked up a wand and I goggles I pour away ignatius and I pull one and I pointed out the thing and I think and the word like a question mark you cast a spell I keep it yeah you are the mage that you're sworn to kill I'm gonna keep this one there is another door leading in it is broken open leading into another room adjacent to this which is a very well appointed alchemical lab and in in the room are shelves and shelves of vials and bottles and several other jars that have preserved organs hands and several preserved heads all stacked up and labeled as well as a large cauldron of burning fire and smoke still burning in this room and that this chemical smell flows through the room from it question do you think those pickled organs taste like no I'm gonna stop you right there no I don't they're used for L chemical supplies for spells they're not reading I start rummaging through the vials looking for any rare ingredients that I might and keep an eye on veo so she doesn't eat any of the ingredients I was just thinking about you really thought of awesome stuff in here like you find Charlie good you're totally good you find phosphorus you find rare chalks that would be used for various various spells you find several samples of cockatrice eggs and Snake Eyes you find a tuft of quagga fur with pieces of amber and silver pins crushed black pearl there's just it's actually so much of everything here there's creepy stuff as well like there's vials of what is there are vials and you turn around the label and it says human blood and there's another preserved vial that just has like what looks like strips of leather and it says flesh of a child and another which is a pouch of dust and it's it says elf bone dust oh boy Eldrick where do you get your supplies for the outcome like these have a question you want to answer it's the children flesh imported or do you do you manufacture it here in the tower do you think the pickled organs we rely on many providers to get some of our more rare and esoteric spell components and ingredients not all of whom are friendly people seemingly squid tentacles yeah that's normal ethos do you think those taste like fried in pan like tasty I think they would be I'm okay with you eating squid I'm not okay with you eating the baby photos Navy flesh there are several jars of pointment made from mushroom powder saffron and troll fat babies that yeah there's so yeah all in all the number of components first four spells in here you could probably find the components for almost any spell even many of the ones with expensive components in this room and as we look for orbs do I do I need anything for my contact other plane spell the material you could find materials for that in in here I don't think it requires any specific costly materials but you can check the spell specifically to determine that you could definitely find them in here if they're needed and yeah just surface-level any orbs any orbs sitting on like podiums or the only noticeable thing is that this the the cauldron in this room that that is burning over and smoking is actually affixed to the floor and is it obviously like on fire like is there a fire underneath it or is it just on its own it's there is no fire underneath it whatever is heating it is the color in itself okay I grabbed a few rare supplies throw them in my bag can you get a sample of what's in the cauldron I are there like tongs anywhere yeah I take some tongs and I take a vial take it to you take it for you just dip it into the cauldron hmm make it our color check 14 it looks like this the components in here it looks like someone is trying to bottle a conjurer elemental spell but you might need a few more but it just needs a few last components to finish it can I like using my Arcana can I tell what ingredients it needs it needs some phosphorous and some gemstones making our counter check and you can try and see if you can get enough 17 it dropped the components in and there's a burst of energy you might have put a little bit too much phosphorus in there make one more or kind of check to see if you can stabilize it 17 [Music] okay you pour some a few more components in I'm gonna step back with the shield pull out my sword okay and there is a blast of hot air that erupts through the room doing 10 points of fire damage to you Sebastian after the concoction cools and there is a glowing red gem in the middle of it so I'm like all singed and like I lift my goggles off and I have that like very distinguished yes yeah and I just like hold up the jam and I'm like is it hot it's very hot guys I finally passed alchemy class [Laughter] Searby anybody else in this room make a gem you can break this gem to summon a fire element know that you why are you getting more pie so much stuff do you got a stir you can roll the d600 this is the fun part three four - okay all right I say we move on yep so we've we've we've conquered alchemy we've conquered alchemy basics there's another class some mystery nation boring I fell asleep no mayo kill the master we took the Rings moving on I say we go down the hall and we take on the first door that we see on the right this is an immaculate room that is filled with stacks of paper and there is a very curious thing in it there is a large table and the top of the table is made of glass and above the table is then it's open like a chest there's a piece of glass and a piece of metal and you can close the table like a chest and underneath the table is a stack of paper and this little cage that has a homunculus in it with a pen and easel what's honking I just want to point a small creature made of clay oh that of all the things we found in this place like I think putting the ape in the the the helmet thing was like by far the least invasive like they do some horrible stuff here I just wanna point out I mean I learned I look around and I see if there's any orbs in the room there are not no night like there's this little creature in this cage with a writing pen yeah hello what's your name it asks you do you have a copy code for nikka desertion 21 place your document on the glass I I grab one of the she's from paper girl it's girl or scroll does that work I grab a scroll I have a scroll of Mage Armor I grab that and I hand it over it looks at it says I can only copy mundane documents but if I sit on the diva the veil sits on the table in the homunculus and a projection appears down on the easel in front of the monk ulis and it draws a rendering of a O's but yes I'm into this guys are having way too much fun I like hold like as you're doing that I pull out my mum's spell book and I'm like I could make copies and then I look up and you're doing this like diary or something important ok it's not important don't worry well now we know the copy code is to the hallway or to the door that's right beside what do you think bye little buddy else is leaving you take that you went take him with you do you want to come with us I have a job to do when was the last time you worked Jesse seconds ago remember with the brooms when we stopped them very busy business just picked up it's true okay have fun we'll be back to retry this room to vote to the left or to the right what does your stomach tell you not copy there the door to the right is fairly close okay yeah okay before the stairs uh know that yeah the next room contains what looks to be another strange device and you can surmise this device is a printing press are there anything what was like can I find out what the last thing yeah the visit have like the imprint or like that yeah it was printing a very dull text about the manifold manifestations of the mage armor spell throughout history believe it and I hated those history classes while learning about where magic came from I just want to learn how to cast it anyway this is a pretty boring room not nearly as exciting as the copy no to the left then and I go to the room to the left and I open the door okay you can all roll a d6 mm-hmm one five one oh no you opened as you go to open a Shias and I check it I can't get the a series of runes flare on the door and there is a keening wail that sounds outwards Oh as a beam of magic fires from the doorway towards each of you and you can each make a wisdom saving throw with advantage ah with advantage because we have that thing from the great feast right oh yeah oh so I get regular because I'm I'm exhausted right oh that was a terrible advantage room the exhaustion only applies to ability checks don't say fifteen fifteen thirteen thirteen five five I peer at the door I'm like what's the one of those runes on that door 350 13 513 okay these two are turned into chickens was it with just a proof of feathers as they are both turned into chickens and a booming voice says apprentices are not permitted in the scrying chamber I tried to yell back but I just you have the brain of a chicken right now I take out some snack so I'm like yeah here and I'm like the doors open though and you can see that there is this singular room has a large pencil up on which is built a large glowing crystal ball cool Adric I have an issue to bring up because you didn't tell us that we weren't allowed to be in this crying room and now I have two chickens as my comrades I can hear they're still telepathically bound to me yeah feed did you trigger an alarm no we just literally walked up the room and it buzzed my few friends into poultry so if you don't want me to eat them you might as well as just tell me how I can turn them back do you know any magic for just doing any way to dispel magic well then the only other way is to give them a swift kick okay okay two seconds two seconds I'll be on old windup okay one as you wind up you hear a clunking noise coming down the hallway That's not me Vale it's coming from which way we from the hallway that you haven't gone down yet and it's coming towards me yeah I okay you hear this clunking noise and then at the same time there's this sound that sounds like rushing water I mean from the elevator area the elevator yeah oh um I grabbed these two by the next oh and I feel an agility down the stairs okay you rush towards the stairs and you slam into an invisible wall of force Oh roll for initiative dry roll what's the stats for a chicken as a chicken what's my decks question is running into the wall force turn them back into regular people it does not just assume your dexterity is minus one okay and second note do I get the advantage of the Sentinel shield I would assume no yeah I don't need to be a human anymore I'm a chicken it's just you veo you and a couple of chickens okay squeeze hard squeeze harder on the neck listen yeah Nuggets better turn back now Roz I will turn you into my dinner think even if you try to eat one of us it actually might help and I'm going to take a big bite okay goal yeah what do you got 26 26 Pluto sixteen sixteen and Sebastian eight eight okay [Music] all right Vail it is your turn what are you going to do do I know how much damage I have to do to these guys I only have one hit point is chickens but any damage that you deal then will carry over I smack them together okay I'm gonna call that an improvised attack it does each of them takes d6 points of damage so both of you take six points of damage and our unch Icahn Oh max D wait should we take one is a chicken and five is oh yeah as a note oh yeah okay sick [Music] yeah what happened well you turned into chickens and elders said I had to smash you in order to turn you back and there's water rushing and there's clunking coming from that way so I panicked and I ran into this wall I mean sorry why do I have feed in my mouth I have like chicken like feed I fed you thank you you're well nourished under my care so that was your action what are you going to do with the rest of your turn mm-hmm I am going to stay put and ready kind of just my body watching for what's coming okay because I can't run anywhere without me turn do chicken Europe I dust myself off acting like I wasn't just a chicken so I try to kind of gain my composure I pull out Ignatius Ignatius and then I walked towards the tea okay in this section and I want to look down each hallway you see to justify weight as you come down the hallway to see an armored figure identical in construction two rivers Guardian he's wearing golden plate armor and bears a flaming sword and a massive shield engraved with it with a very stern and frowning looking face and it has like that kind of gorget style helmet and as you peer down the other hallway you can see the rushing water from the fountain coming up into a swirling amorphous form of a creature rolling down the hallway towards you I drank from my fountain we def filed it that's probably mad yeah we got company okay I and there's a wall behind me I'm up against the wall here Pluto I'm gonna take one step back and the first thing that walks around the corner I'm just gonna swing my sword at it okay so I want to be sort of hidden like into this hallway so they make the armored figure that I'd literally just made eye contact with yeah stepping back one and I'm like getting ready okay the helmed horror lifts off the ground and fly that's not and in a spinning cut makes two attacks with its long sword but what about you just prepared in action yeah yeah I was so ready and now I'm not ready you're ready action does occur yeah but like I'm not ready yeah it gets an 11 and an eight to hit and I swing back at it cool with fire sword I yell Ignatia save me 16 to hit less oh I'm gonna do a precision strike to get a 24 a 20 40 hit yeah okay that is a hit that's what I want to attend then that's gonna be 10 points of regular damage and seven fire okay ignatius clangs into the creatures armor and it leaves a deep rent and you can see that there's nothing but swirling arcane energy inside the plate armor this is just all energy and there's water coming cool next up is Sebastian I don't know what these things are capable of yet so until they start hurting us I'm just gonna I'm just gonna blast it with a fire bolt I see the thing spin around the corner fly home and I blast it 18 it raised shield and blocks it well that was bad now I know what they're made of blocking material apparently yeah I I do that I see it just bounced off his armor and I I dive into the room okay the water elemental rushes down the hallway like flowing water and it moves right up to pollute oh and that's this entire term hello honking yeah water it's like this crashing wave coming down the hallway towards you is you go to the top of the round with Vail I take out my crossbow and I take some shots at I'm gonna go the water elemental but I'm gonna use magic arrows smart ten the arrow just hits the elemental but it just doesn't even splash twenty-one that that does something to it very hard to explain what it might be and Pluto you're faced with it oh yeah where my my crossbow with the magic arrow do you have magic bolt oh no I don't okay so not magic okay regular bolts okay but I can use sneak attack yes yes yeah 24 damage ouch it looks like though with its amorphous body and its watery form the non-magical bolts don't harm it as much as much as they could I still take the same I now turn then to the other floating expiry guy 11 it deflects it as well with his shield and I go into the same room as fashion okay chicken I don't turn around so I have no idea hello doe it is your turn and I just keep on swinging now prioritized target Pluto would naturally fight fire versus water so I'm gonna keep swinging at buddy I'm gonna get it see I know what missus now so I'm gonna use precision strike again to get a like a 26 against the elemental or the had the helmet ever held in horror okay 26 to hit that is a hit for 15 regular damage and 5 fire damage cool you crash in and the front part of its breastplate bursts away and it kind of like the holes it back into arcane alignment around it it is not bloodied because it doesn't plead but it is effectively bloodied and I'm gonna swing at it again for a 25 to hit also a hit for 15 regular damage and 6 fire damage cool and then I'm gonna use a my bonus action - oh I don't know I'm just gonna stand there okay okay you guys I got nothing I'm I'm just gonna post up I'm fighting these things all right the hound horror makes us attacks against you carving into you with its sword getting a 19 and a 7 missmiss okay both deflected off your shield the clang of shield against shield I'm gonna use one of my reactions okay to repost cool and get a 22 to hit that hits four oh yeah these won't get rekt 22 regular damage and eight fire damage as his sword comes down you slam back into is his arm and it just collapses into flying armor and plate and the arcane spirit binding it just goes freaks me out so much because oh gosh oh I died I did that I'm really sorry about your spirit thing I'm really good cool Sebastian you're up I run out of the room and I wrap my arms around Pluto and I Thunder step back into the room okay the elemental has to make a constitutional statement girl yes 17 it fails gracias sometimes I get the hug from behind yeah and I yeah hands grab you and you just your mm-hmm and there's a big explosion I'm gonna use a point a sorcery point to re-roll two of those we're in the room because remember you have to end up somewhere where you can still see with under step okay back there okay good call and that's gonna be 19 damage nice very nice okay the water elemental flows into the room and flows over top of AO and pollute Oh enter your spaces the two of you need to make strength savings right oh good 23:23 I'm not strong enough I got a 16 you both succeed okay so you are both pushed forward in front of the elemental then because it tried to flow over you and engulf you oh you're both pushed out of it so like a wave just go on on the front in the room not out of the room though yeah yep as it tried to well well here's an excuse you we go to the top with Vail um I'm going to use my cutting action to disengage from it move across the room to a corner and I'm going to use my magic longbow to take some shots okay / 14 that is a hit great cool cool and I can use my sneak attack you should be sneak-attack able yes 27 damage there it is and then the second one also a hit that 120 damage oh it is muddy muddy yeah yeah cool great round veil Pluto we're over to you um being washed out I just stand up is ignatius still lit yep with the fires of the sacred flame fire against water really work 1910 is a hit 4:14 sorry I yeah it's +9 so 14 regular damage and four fire damage your blade crashes down into the water elemental and the the heat is so hot it turns the elemental to Steve boiling it so how much damage was that fourteen regular and four fire okay and then I come down again with a twenty something to hit also a hit or 12 regular damage and three fire damage but I want to use distracting strike on it which I think and then for another eight regular damage it is distracted to death oh yes perfect as the as you twist the blade at the last moment to deflect it you catch it in the essence in its quintessence a and the whole thing just it's like there's a membrane and it just collapses and just water crashes out everywhere all on the floor collapses all over the floor yep really you all soaked I'm so unhappy use the heat of ignatius to warm us I actually create a small campfire oh I yourself could you like blow dryer I can I consider that Nixon a puff of wind yeah thank you thank you yeah that's nice I have that nice blown back look on my hair and then my furs it's like like I'm a big poofy fur ball right now cuz I didn't condition properly after this is why I don't like baths the helmed horror is it does it like this is the armor anything that shields the essence of the creature it's what the essence inside is what makes it magical okay it is immaculately built full plate armor at shield and sword but destroyed and discombobulated the they're no longer magical okay well we have an orb here they were not allowed to touch it or else he turned into you no no that was the door oh the door turned us into chickens and the Rings burn you and everything hates us here or show me the basement level use the magic hand again I put my mage hand on the orb nice and when you place your hand on the orb you feel in your mind that you could cast the arcane eyes fell from this orb once today so you can send out an arcane eye and it will go out into the halls of the Academy all the holes you it creates an arcane eye as the spell so he then can control it with eagle with the only caveat that the arcane I cannot pass through walls but it can pass through the doors of the Academy trysting hmm should I do it where do you want to go I mean I can arcane I this whole place literally spend some moments just look at it if you guys can see if you guys can secure this room just make sure nothing else gets messed up I can do some navigation yeah I'm gonna close the door and begin to barricade it with anything in the room including myself and I I sit with my mage hand on the orb and I concentrate on arcane eye all right and that is where we're gonna end for tonight cool this this place is like a it's like a what's it was a thing at carnivals a funhouse yeah like it's like a funhouse yes yeah great great time good to
