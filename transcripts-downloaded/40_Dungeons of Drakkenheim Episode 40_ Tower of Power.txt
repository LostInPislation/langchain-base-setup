to the ruins [Music] Drakken I'm is no more struck by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed Wolf Aleve the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon Highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to woo the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches but now and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of the Academy Tower eldritch energy crackles through the air as the bright and brilliant explosion fades and your vision returns to you on the ground before you around the shattered Tower of the amethyst Academy are the bloodied and near vaporized remains of Oscar urine and the shards of the staff of power Pluto lies unconscious on the ground vayo and Sebastian grievously wounded from the explosion like parts of your clothing are in shreds there's just these bits of burns and soot all covering your faces and you go to breathe in and realize that the Delirium residue from the exploded delirium shard is hanging in this air so you hack and you cough and let you feel just all of this arcane energy is humming in the air you can smell the ozone around you and feel it in your skin almost all the hairs in your body are standing on end as if the most incredible electric shock has just shot through the area which it basically has Sebastian hacks and coughs and crawls his way over to Pluto Jackson's body and checks his pulse I don't feel it I don't feel anything I run over and I say he'll be fine just give him the potion and I grab a potion out of his bag whatever the IKE I sift through him like which one's the best one I also don't know how to take check pulses so he might still be good Hey I don't know what potion this is bag here you go buddy and I take one out of yours and I'm like here you go it's a team effort my dope oceanvale feeds me a potion out of my bag out of your bag and I feed myself what's happening is it I was a poet I had a potion of greater healing so I guess that's gone now I have a potion of superior healing how much is that that's 40 oh yeah I need that and greater is 20 mm-hmm what did you have I think I have a grater mmm as I finished feeding Pluto the potion I put my fingers up to my head to communicate telepathically and I say Eldrick hmm there's been an incident you hear in your mind this almost garbled mass of psychic communication coming back towards you and you can feel the interference of the arcane energy now in the in the area you might need to move to somewhere else for clear communication you want me to fly to the edge and down a little bit to see if it gets out of the haze you should probably get you guys out of the haze anyways let me just get Pluto up I'm still under the effects like a function of flying mm-hmm so I literally like run to the edge and like jump off the edge and I who are still under the effects of the potion playing yes you just drank a healing potion to 2013 okay all right and I run off and I jump and I like just kind of like motor in the air like oh not falling flying back down the library and then I like who down yes down the library as I'm going I'm like can you hear me now can you hear me now the reception is really terrible where are you are you I so we're in the library and we may have just killed Oscar and and he well he actually to be honest killed himself but we did did good damage good damage wait Oscar urine was in the tower oh yeah yeah yeah he was there was he was there he had the staff of power he blew it up I'm struggling to pull a semi-conscious Pluto out of the delirium haze as well by the underarms I'm like and I just like get you out an X channel open I I'm like guys did I miss anything look Oscar broken staff lots of delirium lots of dead things yeah yeah that's that's them yeah you better have a plan B because Oscar yarn had the staff of power and that staff of power was smashed and we all almost died can we fix it he destroyed the staff of power yeah with all of us in the room you survived oh pretty more or less Oh big deal I was the closest did you see his body his body is mush there do you have the pieces of the staff I can go get them one second and I run back in and I scoop up all the pieces and I like in a broom like into my bag of holding it's the staff has been split in Twain so the top part of the staff with the the orb and the flanges is still one piece and as is the base of the staff the mid section of the staff has broken into about seven large splinters right where Oscar you're on snap smashed it against polluter shield basically to blow it up you're able to pick up all the pieces but as you run back into the haze give me a constitution saving TRO I don't want to roll that dice that was fine eleven okay you take eight points of radiant damage and suffer one level of exhaustion okay all right as you step back into the area that of the Hays up there where the residual energy from the char that that veio destroyed is still gathering and you just feel it you're breathing it in now you retreat back with the pieces and Eldrick speaks to you telepathically through the telepathic bond and says you have the pieces I have all the pieces the place is getting filled with haze and I I don't know if we can keep fighting through this but we gotta get to the top of the tower I is there any way that we can use this staff the top part of the staff is still intact I'm hoping that I can use it as a wand or something the destruction of a staff power is not without precedent it has happened before in fact to that very staff at least twice it can be restored it will take months of work I mean we don't have months is is there a way I can activate the Nexus without the staff you can try you can use what remains of the staff and you can try the staff itself is both key and focus without the staff in complete condition its functionality as a focus to give you the full control to be able to channel the power of the Nexus could cause serious backlash the staff focuses and conducts the arcane energies of the Nexus and without it complete the only way the only place for those energies to go is into a body does it does it have to it's a you can ask does it have to be a live body or can it be a dead body it has to be one capable of pulling magical energy in of some kind a dead body of an animate undead creature perhaps could pull that power in provided it had some sort of arcane essence to it any living creature can in theory be used as a conduit as long as there was some sort of spell caster able to chant help channel that energy it may be that the three of you could work together and spread out some of the damage between you I'm in if you guys are in the only alternative is if you can secure the teleportation chamber we may be able to send some more support as well but at this stage a retreat is a viable option we need this tower if you guys are going to gain control I stand with powers and drunkenness no retreat I don't see retreat as an option I'll jump you know as well as I do the queen of Thieves is up to something there's a lot of things at work here in Drakon hime and time is not on our side and we need to start figuring this out and the least I can do I've made it this far the least I can do is try you can again well under normal circumstances repairing staff could take months there are other resources in Drakon hime that could be used to repair it there is more delirium in the city than anywhere else perhaps you could use that and you could go down to the deep selves and see if you can find someone there we could make a deal with I have so many questions what about that last sentence underneath the tower are the deep cells underneath this Tower this tower every tower has deep cells it is where we store the most dangerous creatures and arcane artifacts that the amethyst academy has ever could has ever assembled with any luck those chambers remain sealed and you could use what remaining to the staff of power to gain access to those chambers there would be very powerful creatures kept there with any luck and other powerful arcane artifacts of evil nature artifacts that and creatures that have it within their power to potentially repair the staff of power or be used to control the Nexus can we trust these people you've locked up for what is at least 15 years No so option a is we go up we share the potential threat we try to work together to use the power of the staff to turn the Nexus back on option B is we go down to the deep cells to try to repair the circle and try to find a monster to help us fix the staff is that the two options that you've laid out there are a few creatures that are down there that could potentially serve that purpose are you able to give me like a checklist because the last thing I want to do is go down there have like some demon be like your soul for the staff and I go okay and then the next thing I know there was a guy next door who was like I'll fix it for a sandwich like I don't it can you like give me like a top is there a name do you have like somebody in mind who who's probably the most willing to work with pain like there are two terrible creatures stored in the deep cells they have been there for several hundred years that would have the power to do it olga mac of the abyss an ancient hid fiend that was found and imprisoned here generations ago and the genie of tark here neither can be trusted and both will try to get the best of you but it is certainly within their power to grant any wish to a mortal oh all right now we have one other option yeah you know you said we could use a dead body we do have a dead I think either way there needs to be somebody holding the staff though that can cast a spell the three of us an Oscar yeah we can use Oscars body you mean like what's left of it yeah these are some arm up there I mean if I know anything about Oscar is that he's like mostly not even him anyways yeah so I should just make him again would he would the dead person come back to life we use him for this someone who was dead is not you can't use it just a corpse no you would need an undead sure I know how awful one at that we're not doing that no no I do have a book of necromancy not not nope what if we just found a subject that we made them unconscious what if you use them one more idea what if we just pulled out so many animals from your best idea I mean I don't condone animals filleting it - we're gonna be holding the staff there's gonna be the three of us and then we get like eight Apes also and we have animal friends I would have we form like a circle of trust around the staff the Nexus will assault you mind body and soul a weak creature like livestock will be likely well Jessica but most likely imploded instantaneously that doesn't give me much courage for myself what I'm hearing is tiny barbecue we're gonna make a barbecue tell you what Eldrick we're gonna have a little team huddle here and we'll get back to you one second I still think if we channel it through us three and several animals that might not be terrible but I mean it sounds like they're gonna just explode everywhere and it's gonna be the three of us anyway or do we go down to the basements and try to work out a deal with a genie or a fiend does it hurt to ask we could always say no to them we could always try to use the staff first and then if it doesn't work then the part of the genie that creates more problem more magical problem because the only other option is waiting for them to repair it but that can take months like Sebastian you're the most knowledgeable about magic so you're leaving it on me no I trust your judgment though what about this I may be the most knowledgeable about magic but I'm also my determination and sometimes get the better can we think of for another entity that's not super evil that also owes us a favor that can make one's purse snaps of power hold again I mean like the crazy horn demon it doesn't really owe us anything thank you maybe he thank you maybe he's better than a jeanny that's imprisoned you see though every time we've talked to him he has been a complete jerk he's got annoying riddles but I mean maybe yes it wants our souls maybe we can maybe the genie will not want my soul yeah maybe the genie just wants like some gold or us to set them free which also is a terrible idea do not set a genie three more opinions or if it fiend don't don't set any of them free cuz I feel like that's probably what they want right oh man if that's what they want that's gonna be such a problem could you send them to hell I mean technically it's getting them out of the cell but yeah and you've done it before you guys get the attempt dice turn on your sender he'll move just do it can reap or drag them to hell I mean it unless they punch Reaper and Reaper dies and goes back to Hell himself which is more likely okay you guys this is this is tough were like we got to do something this tower is just sitting here I mean Oscars dead but we don't have months to just try to get this tower operational a lot can happen in months a lot has happened in months mm-hmm that's true if we leave this for more months we could let our enemies get the upper hand is Oscar dead dead I mean I guess I dragged you out of there before you woke up fully uh yeah you got you guys retreated before you really investigated the area huh yeah pretty good you described him being mushy gross bits that I was writing in as I was greatly good like what if we tried to just like salvaged what we could have his body I mean if you want to go back into that haze I mean you want to bring him back though like maybe maybe we can think maybe when we bring him back we do like a mind trick thing on him you were good all the time and you like I do you also have I reach into my bag of holding and I pull out two hands with six rings on them if I can take some time to study Oscars notes maybe I can make my own clock with these hands on it and it can help us with this I don't know what else is gonna be the fastest way are some police our initial fastest conversation so do you want to go to that you want to go to the June first I'm gonna go talk to the two uh most people in the basement I'm open for and always say no hopefully do we have anything upstairs to finish yeah turning on the Nexus will the the Archmage we only got to see her right it's less through the arcane I drew yep you owe me served her through a yep through the arcane I can we also take a little break before we do either of these I I also have this thing and I there's also that um I forgot what it was the scepter or something there yes the librarians rod yeah I wonder if this could help us at all I I can cast identify but it's gonna take me a bit of time to do so how long 11 minutes yeah and what do you want to identify this librarian staff see what its properties are see of me Oh true sorry you want to identify it yeah if I can like wedge the staff of power onto either end of this thing and use it as like a conduit to bridge that I don't know but I think if I can find if there's some magical properties here maybe I can figure something out you know I'm all for this sort of like patchwork magic let's try it do you want to take a short rest or no I mean I'll be spending the rest can I take a short rest and also do a few things at the same time like can my rest be casting identify yeah I mean you if you all want to take a short rest you just add 10 minutes on to it to cast the ritual yeah sure yeah yeah I say we we give ourselves a well earned a little rest so we perch next to some library books I don't even think I need to cast tiny height I feel like this is hanging out we're just gonna hang out okay you all take your short rest so you can regain your your respective hit dice and all that jazz identifying this rod yeah this rod is a physical manifestation of unique form of magic known as pact magic it is a bond between a spellcaster and their patron and it seems to have been gifted to the librarian by an entity known only as borer haze so this is known as the rod of bore haze and all that you can determine through through identify is that bore Hayes's a esoteric entity that is said to watch over libraries hmm and functionally speaking it is a rod of the pact keeper [Music] interesting whoa it may uh because it is also the rod of the librarian it may allow you to access spaces in the tower as well functioning similarly to the key the key functionality of the staff of power is it a plus one right off the bat keeper yes I am NOT a woman but I'm gonna add it anyway so I know I have because we can swing it around at things and be like open your doors or what if like your mom's Journal has something or what if now what else do we know can channel magic well in in identifying this rod do I see any conceivable way to make a patchwork staff or would that be very beyond my skill level that is very beyond your skill level I try for a bed I'm like yeah tinkering with it I'm like I don't think this is gonna work guys well well we're bandaging ourselves up and eating a little bit of food that we brought why do usually rations seem awfully low we didn't love you then how are we you also need to eat sometimes I brought my rations I thought you were responsible for holding the party's rations I brought my rest have a have a ration never I appreciate you rationing out what are you guys what do you guys think should we go make a deal with the genie I think we should check out the area first because we could maybe we're powerful enough who knows yeah I'm really strong look but I think if we can find out what they want and if we say no then we can at least give it a go oh you guys so now all right so you got so Sebastian says go up one says go down what do you say ty burger bar we'll go up and see I put a card Pluto you know what I get the next vote I get the next vote autumn will go up this has nothing no will go up and we'll see what we can figure we're just so close it's just there's a ladder right over there all right friend of you know forever childhood that's right all right rations hoarder so you head back up from the base of the library to the tear and the power back in the space where the meteor crashed through the Tower of the amethyst Academy a field of rubble and ruin rooms that whatever their purpose once was is almost impossible to determine the books still fluttering like flocks of seagulls in the air finally trying to find bookshelves that are no longer there the rope-ladder dangles through the motes of rock that float through the air connecting the bay the bottom part of the tower to the top part it is a very precarious looking climb of approximately 75 maybe 100 feet the tail end of the rope ladder dangles down at the bottom the there beyond that there are the ruins of Oscar yarns makeshift workshop having it been exploded basically twice the racked ruins of Oscar yarns body and there are several bits of the workshop that are still relatively intact because they didn't get hit by either explosion but most of the place is a disaster in any case there still might be some there still might be something salvageable there I would like to hold my breath because the haze is still kind of prominent here because of all the things that went down so I'm going to hold my breath and run in and start looking around Oscar yarns body and his lab equipment okay since you want to do this really really quickly you can make an investigation check with disadvantage but a constitution saving throw with advantage so which would you like to roll first I'm gonna roll the Constitution save with advantage okay 24 okay managed to gird yourself you wrap it so something over over your face once it once again and rush into the the area to see what ever you might be able to find it's gonna be a sixteen okay so you rush into Oscar yarns workshop and the desk where you where you teleported in is the first place that you run to because that area was relatively free of explosions as you search around you see several potion vials that are still intact there are eight potion vials around here that are filled with various kinds of liquid not all of them look the same although you recognize at least to look like they might be potions of healing of some kind and to might be Oscars version of aqua delirium there are several you also see Oscar's spell book on the table and a small Idol of the demon I take all of the above okay grab it all and you run out does anyone else want to attempt to mate to look around anywhere well well so that was the exploded room but there was rooms beside and correct yeah is there a way to get in without going through the the actual workshop itself is there a way to get up to the rope ladder without going through a rope ladder I guess is in the other room correct yeah it's yeah so yes there's many safe ways safe ways to get to the rope ladder without going through Oscar's workshop yeah because there was like I guess a way around the other way that was open is there anything in that room that room has a few old bookshelves the remnants of what might have been a summoning circle of some kind are in here and you can see on the walls are several sets of shackles and manacles and what looks to be some the remnants of some kind of arcane furnace or machine what this chamber might have once been possibly some kind of summoning chamber I didn't find anything cool I just found a summoning chamber like you know knowledge magic I'm more like the instant stuff like sparks I want fire where's the razzle-dazzle yeah no resultado in this room I'm also gonna look around in the other areas that are not hazy okay I'll have the two of you both make investigation checks as well then if you're gonna look as well well yeah you're doing you're a totally well I'm risking my life you guys are just gonna casually browse yeah mm-hmm nine Pluto you find very large pieces of delirium those gigantic pieces of delirium look at that and you find a copy of a picture book that seems to be my children's book about the ABCs of magic and another book called casting your first can trip I hide both of them in my sack available on the other hand I do search search around and you manage you find scattered on one in one of the other rooms what look like the remnants of there's a pair of hands hiding in one of the corners and there the first year like are those rats and there's a pair of hands that are in one of the corners screwing around my feral instincts go in you know you know when you see a cat's eyes they go real wide like their pupils dilate that happens and I'm like guys guys weirdest thing but I'm slightly not surprised that this is happening I go after it okay make a dexterity check 20 you rush forward and chase after the hands and they start screwing away running on their fingertips away and you managed to catch up to them what do you want to do join I want to grab their wrists so that way their fingers are just dangling you grabbed them you lift them up and they they're moving and they struggle and as you hold them these hands they're these these pair of they're still leaking a bit of blood out of them but that you can see that both of them have been severed with surgical precision and so it's a it's a perfect cut like someone took a bone saw to the hand to the edge of the wrists and you can see that there are these the fingernails are dirty the hands themselves are the are they are probably a man's hands are kind of pudgy there's flecks of to lyrium and stains on the fingertips as as well and there are on one of the the hands there are burn marks around the ring finger are these do I recognize these as Oscar's hands they are Oscar's hands gross but also cool but also I want that keep them uh guys I have real moving hands that are probably Oscars make a because and I know your favorite enemy make an intelligent make a intelligence check and add double your proficiency bonus double proficiency yah27 so you know and you've heard of this before these are creatures it seems that Oscar has turned his hands into a creature called a crawling claw their undead creatures their animate undead hands they've been on the floor what are you what are you doing what did you find the hands are just trying to make like grabby notions that you're trying to strangle you I assume this is a parlor trick that you're it's like when you get like crab claws and you make them work with the tendons like what are you doing veo what game you're playing they the they're moving hands I thought I thought hands couldn't move unless they're attached to something um wasn't there something we could reuse these a dead creature can't hold the staff but an undead creature okay hands if we got all if we hold an undead hand while we channel the power through us that counts as extra magic they look pretty magical to me we'll just hold them by the wrists and we have two extra oscar hands he was a powerful magician yeah there's a powerful mage not magician can I just ask a magic question is most of it improv because that's what I'm kind of getting the feel of like it seems like sometimes you guys are like talking about like super crazy wild magic and then sometimes it just looks like you're winging it let me ask you a follow-up question Pluto Jackson when you go into a fight alright always winging it there's skill involved there's skill and understanding but every fight is different and you always have to improvise I like the magics the same okay and then I I go back to my little book of ABC's magic is improv a is for alchemy this could work though this could be extra power this could be I don't want to put them in the bag of holding mms my stuff cages are like that you know like I look around for like a box or like a cage or like something to put the hands in there's the manacles that are attached to the wall i i'm manacle the two hands together well the manacles are attached to the wall it was off the wall I can wear the back around my neck dangling hands you can you can take the manacles off the wall and you attach some of the hands and it's like a leash alright that's all we need the hands generally they get on the ground and one of the hands goes up and it basically tries to crawl up you and start to try to like just grab onto your neck oh no and I like no more the Train yeah you're gonna have to do some work they you know what they had a rough time before there were some people that didn't appreciate them they just needed love and some patience high five okay yeah keeping Oscars hands as pence now yes for you gotta take care of them no I'll feed them I'll clean up after them what do they eat what's the worst that could happen hey I feeling that they won't feed them she's kind of I don't know I get along another thing need i'll moisturize you know yeah like okay they've obviously been abused those burn marks so I got this you guys want to climb a ladder huh what yes when when Pluto's not looking I've started to tie a rope around me and him I hope I can notice oh hey hey this is just in case I fall I'm a little nervous about this ladder oh do you wanna um I mean I have climbing speed but do you want to use my movable rod as like extra support yes okay use the rope the right I use the rope but like yeah you can tell yourself you know rope move or odd just in case you following us there it is a precarious climb but working together with the movable rod and each other you are able to climb up the precipitous 75 or so feet through the and you can feel like the wind likes way across the ladder and there are bolts of electrical lightning that shoot through as you as you climb up the hair on your body stands on end and you might you know you might be be feeling it in the in the stomach make it churn as you swing in the air but you manage to all climb your way up onto the upper part of the tower like leaving the hands up [Laughter] mm-hmm well that was fun that's a bit I think we're onto something here we have hands we have half a staff of power like together that's like a full Oscar it's like one Oscar casting maybe I don't know he got pretty powerful in the end he was a he's not not a pushover probably should've taken care of him you know when we should have at the beginning when I was given the job to murder him mm-hmm like months ago yeah we learned so much from him we used him until he was used up yeah he's all used up now he's all used up you were in the hulls here are cracked and broken and there are still bits that are wholly collapsed but you are very close to where the elevator shafts are in the overall building and the halls here appear through through several of the broken walls on the lower level you can see through two chambers that appear to be well-appointed living rooms and bedrooms the apartments of the senior members of the Academy that would have dwelt here they all connect over to the rest of the main library and as you walk through the remnants of this room it seems that like groups of the mages would have their own private rooms and then a common room and then a shared workshop that they would all collaborate in probably some of the finest apartments and that you can see and there's there's still like broken brooms that are still trying to sweep through the halls and clean things up as well and once or once or twice you bump into a wayward unseen servant avoid the brooms what was that who was that a quick question was I able to discern what exactly potions I got from Oscar or those going to be mysteries annoyed yeah just you haven't looked at them yet but if you want to spend some time to check them out right now four of them are potions of greater healing there are two doses of aqua delirium and then one of the potions is a potion of heroism and one of the potions is a potion of invisibility potion heavy can I have a potion of this ability there you go yes and there there were two Scrolls that you found one was a scroll of animate dead and one was a scroll of create Undead that's scary no undead creatures can help us channel the power Barnum not use an Oscar because I'm kind of things Gary so he took the hands off the Archmage mm-hmm so she's kind of in need of hands right now some might say where are you are you going we have fun we have like brand-new hands that are like pretty active and that's they're trying to strangle one of us no yeah maybe there's I mean we can do a little swap arou the main problem is when you see the room that the Archmage is in hmm you'll see you'll see mm-hmm you'll see one coming in didn't you describe this I described it as dangerous oh and um this my place is dangerous I mean at this point yeah I'm a little nervous about everything it was raised undead in control and I animate dead and create undead weren't there also when my arcane I was up here there were mowed Ron's somewhere were they level up they were in at the Nexus and there was a fountain that was populated by them as well at the one of the fountains by the elevators well guys do you want to keep going I'm just gonna say do are we gonna head up to the Nexus or is it too dangerous you said it was dangerous yeah but we can go to the doorway it's just I was looking for like the swirling hurricane of awful yeah so I did describe it to you yeah yeah you kind of gave us like a brief overview I say we go up to that doorway and see what we can do yeah poke our heads in see what's what okay the way you head back to the elevator room where there is a fountain control where there are three mode runs circular creatures with small wings and little spindly metallic arms that dive down into the the into the fountain scoop up water with a bucket and then pour it back down again and they do so in in geometric patterns so they'll all in perfect synchronization scoop down the water flutter around in a circle then dump it all together there are the four elevator shafts here all of them when you look down the shafts you just look down to the mess below don't don't go in there yeah out of order yeah I use mold earth to put out of order on the guys I'm reading these scrolls I could create a few minions for us if we need more people to channel the energy I think we between the hands the undead that I can create the three of us I think we might have a good chance could we also use Reaper it might be the last thing I'm able to do for a while but yeah we can get along summoning energies if we can get enough undead then I think I think we should be okay I mean Crowley will be in there - sorry died hmm you know we bring it back undead power do you have one of these I can use to bring three corpses back as ghouls and the other one I can use to bring a skeleton or zombie back they could you use it on the Archmage I could goo Olaf I the Archmage potentially could we gula phi the library I mean there were also several corpses lying outside the Nexus there were dead creatures that had died there well so I might be able to animate them yeah again mm-hmm giving us a small squad because it would be it would be powerful people that would be up here yeah I feel like it would be like yeah like the Archmage or like maybe some of her like compadres yeah make sense it's gonna get weird I've never really risen the dead before well they will they be friendly to you or is they gonna start dragging us if I can do this correctly yeah okay perfect yeah perfect I've never doubled in necromancy it was kind of like not my favorite like a no-go I'm afraid if I'm dead be aware that casting create undead it does take one minute even with this role so you will need one minute to to do that and the scroll provides all the material components that you need but if you do wish to do that you will need to find a corpses and you had said that there were corpses in and around the entrance to the next hour all right yeah cool cool cool yeah yeah like it has to work what's the worst that can happen right right yeah I'm drinking another - no I'm drinking if I drink more than one healing potion does it also have science no it's only when you combine handling potions with other things I could also use an aqua delirium but I mean we'll cross that bridge when we get there I'm gonna drink another greater healing potion okay how are you guys gonna get up to the Nexus are there no stairs yeah yeah we only find the elevator shaft we could try to take the elevator when I was when I was flying the ayah Reinert oh I went up the elevator show didn't I can't we try to use the elevator like if we try to hit the button I pull a lever by the elevator nothing happens definitely out of order well let's look for some stairs right there's got to be stairs around here that would be a safety hazard if there what if the elevator goes down people upstairs in the Nexus need to be able to leave the tower they probably just like he's magic oh that's really good I even have magic that does that too so can we okay where do I have to climb up no can only help us when we go down so if we really need to like well let's look for stairs first that seems like the obvious choice okay moving has the apartments and down the halls you come to another set of doors that lead to the library which just as before has the set of stairs connecting the levels between them you could take this library out as far as it these stairs up as far as they go yeah that's fine yeah can anything up is up can i heading up through the library you eventually come to the loft of the library which is a the library comes up to the highest level where there is a massive set of reading rooms and desks where they fill the entire floor of the library here in the center of which is the other set of elevators and stairs leading up several more levels the spiral staircase in the center up and up up until we reached the nexus i yeah we're on a mission right now I don't have time to okay and we can browse later oh yeah we can absorb take pictures along the way you take these spiral stairs and pass through a set of heavy double pass by a grand balcony with a set of double doors that can only be the Archmage's chambers they are closed the stairs continue up to the Nexus about what I just said do you guys want to check out these Archmage's chambers one of these is probably a key we could get distracted easily do we want to do just to call you just want to see if you're doing your mom's stuff is in there don't you I mean she wasn't the Archmage anymore but there might be something never know there's history stuff in there well now you've talked me into it I pull out the top part of the staff of power and I walk up to the Archmage door and I like try to figure out how this works do I push on the door and like touch the staff to it at the same time there's a flash of light and the doors whoosh open no that worked well it's working at maximum efficiency it's fine what's in the room inside is a grand chamber it is at first lined with the Archmage's personal library heading up from floor to ceiling and in there in the Archmage's chamber here it goes out onto a great balcony overlooking the entire city where there is a massive astrolabe attached to a telescope and several and in fact as you open up the door and step in the room the doorway is still there behind you but the room continues around and the door is just floating in space and the entire place it's like the ceiling disappears and the walls disappear and it just looks out as if it's this massive platform overlooking the entire city there is a set there are several sets of bookshelves that form the borders of various rooms and other doorways floating in space with staircases leading up to them that some of which are at impossible angles and in this central chamber there is a large circular couch and there is a massive so there's the Atmos astrolabe which is a model of the planet with all the spheres rotating around it and the couches at the base of it looking up at the planet and then out on one of the balconies you can see this massive telescope pointed up at the stars with impact a cheerleading out to it and surrounding the astrolabe and the telescope you can see as well floating or between all of the doorways are these chalkboards that are covered in formulas and bits of writing and scrolls and books all floating about and you can see that there are these prominent designs and of the different arrangements of the planes of existence so you recognize one of the patterns is this machine that is like this great real churning not dissimilar to the design on the front of the clock tower itself but there's a stack of books all beside it as well there is another model though that shows this design of the planet and then all these other spheres rotating and orbiting all around it and you recognize that the runes on those planets are the runes for the different known planes there is another model that is a stack of disks that are all tied to each other on a string and just and they kind of loop in on each other like a mobius strip and each of them is there's a there's stacks of books beside them and as you walk up to them you can see that each of them are labeling these these are the different theories of the cosmology of the unit of the multiverse that they are that has been studied for four years and they're all like working models of the different possible cosmologies guys I need to become the Archmage I want this bedroom for the bedroom I walk over to the one that's showing all the different planes rotating around it and I want to look for any correlation can I like wind it back or forwards each of them has like a small pedestal and a wheel that wine and like the gear work that winds the whole thing up I start winding the planes back and I can see that as you wind there is a a there's a ring on the bottom and the ring has the dates going back thousands of years and you can turn the crank on each model and in fact as you turn it the wheel rotates but when it rotates around a full 360 degrees it's like the years have impossibly continued even though the one ring one rotation of the Ring is a hundred years but when you rotate it around the numbers on the ring change to correspond to that and you notice that depending on how fast or slow you rotate it it looks you look down at the ring again and even the dates are slower and spanned out so if you rotate it really fast it rotates through the millennia but if you rotate it very slowly it rotates through just the days and the minutes only out B and then it just shows all these different times when the planes layer in on top of each other so as I says I figure this out and I I'm like just puzzled by it and I'm trying to figure out the the mechanics of it I start to try to piece together I'm king of the clock tower and the two planes that it stuck on and I'm trying to think back to the date that I read about the clock tower getting stuck and also the date that the meteor hit which are two separate occasions but I want to I want to look for any correlations or clues in the planes which model do you want to try that try this with I'm doing it with the planes the grid so there's several different ones that are all the planes okay right there the one that was like the planes rotating around the earth is different there's the so there's several different models and as you can go up to them you can see them actually labeled one of them is called the Great Wheel and one of them is called the world axis another is called the orbit and another is called the conjunction I'm gonna try the conjunction so the conjunction is the stack of disks okay yeah and as you rotate this stack it basically shuffles the disks and so they overlap and they grind against each other and they move over top of each other as if in this constant rotation of chaos and dancing and as you come towards the and as you rotate around and through it you what do you want what date do you want to rotate to first I think first I want to try the date that the meteor struck okay probably closest as you rotate around towards the meteor there to the date of the meteor several days before it there is a flash of light and this additional rock appears and it rotates around the entire array and as you get to the date of the meteor it collides with the disc that represents the material plane what you guys saw that right yeah I think I'm onto something I'm sorry that I'm postponing Nexus can we but this I I feel like if I can just figure something out there's a clue here I want you to go to another one and see if it does the same thing I go to the one I go to what the orbit and I find the same date a similar thing happens the orbit one depicts all the different planets rotating around each other and depicts the planes almost their own planets and this one is the orbit and as it does so and as you get to the date this shard appears from an unknown source and it rotates around the material and then collides with the material if I go and check each one do they all do that yes what if we go to today's date and a follow-up question what dates were they set on before we started turning them they were on the current date so when you take their hands off of them they were set to the current day I go back and I want to wind it back to the date that the Clocktower stops with each of them as as you wind them all back making an Arcana check [Music] 9 ok you can't quite make sense of what's going on here but give me one investigation check instead to see if you notice the detail 17 ok you can't figure out what's going on but the only thing that you notice is that in all of these models as you wind them back the plains of mechanis and limbo are almost in lockstep with each other as if they are always kept at distance from for one another and as you wind it back to the moment where the clock stopped stuck you can see that pandemonium and limbo and mechanicus have been in this almost planar undertow for at least a hundred and eleven years and in each model they seem to be caught in each other's gravity and then as soon as you go back if you go past 100 million years that what happens between them is not seem to correspond at each other so the moment the clock tower stopped they became in sync with each other in this sort of orbit of their own accord for a hundred and eleven years they stay in that from the moment until and then what does that have to do with the meteor whatever okay I have a question we can ask Eldrick but what about if we try to go forward in time on these machines Wow what happens if you start to go slowly it stops at the present date because this is the interesting thing is that they wouldn't have known the meteor was coming because they couldn't have checked ahead right right so I'm trying to figure out where this magic is like what it's calling upon I'll trick you there yes we're all feeling much better we've had a bit of a rest we've put some stuff together we found some ways that we might be able to get the Nexus to work for us we've also gone into the Archmage's chambers have you ever seen these these chambers in dragon I'm no I new mode era but I had never visited her personal chambers she was a brilliant scholar of the plains yeah so we're looking at a lot of the plains here and you know the clock tower in in Drakon Heim how it's been stuck for a hundred and eleven years is that something you're aware of no hmm well this conversation isn't going the way I planned at all anyway toodaloo maybe your maybe your mother's Journal has maybe some answers it does it deliver reference anything about the plains or I flip open my mum's journals and start frantically flipping through the pages looking for anything to to do help mechanics or Panama I mean you need to spend some time to really go through this to find references to that alright so it doesn't go ahead in time it stops at the current date it predicts the meteor hitting I think for now the only answer we're getting out of this is that the planes shifted in some way but I I can't figure out how that corresponds with the meteor is there any feels like it should should the wall are they attached to something there are no walls no there's only floor how big are they how big are these yeah they range in size from from ten feet across to the the largest one the Great Wheel is about thirty feet wide I was hoping I'd be able to take them with them I feel like you know they're they're mass efficient I feel like if we can reclaim this tower we can always come back here and study this further this is another place that I would like to lock down as an additional lab for research you basically have like your like the Starbucks of labs in dragon hime you're like how do you have no labs everywhere I have a portable lab I have a lab at my dad's place I have a lab in your tower I have a lab in Oscars basement and now this one and there was that other one we found oh yeah the the juice lab yeah yeah what's elapsed well one more can I have one more thought yeah go for it we're just workshopping this lutely there's no stupid answer mechanis questions and limbo are the two mm-hmm what was their relationship when the meteor hit we'd go to that day because we know the relationship from the clock tower stomping yeah as you rewind the Great Wheel wherever this flash of light of purple light comes from that collides with the Material Plane each time you rewind it back it comes from a different place it doesn't originate from any of the it doesn't originate from any of the planes it kind of comes out of space and collides and the relationship between mechanis and limbo is it the same as as was for the hundred and eleven years prior yes okay yeah okay let's just stockpile this all okay I don't I feel like it would take hours maybe even days or weeks and I feel like once again once this place is secure we can call in much smarter spellcasters than me don't don't sweat it I mean I think it's teasing out something it is and we and I think we think we've got some you know I never thought I'd say this but I really wish I'd stuck it out in school a little bit longer you know well let's just cast some spells to him I never need all my planes classes and you skip them all the time don't skip geography never definitely skipped plane's class to go strawberry astronomy physics astrophysics yeah I really just went to like the cleaners Tech taught me how to shoot fire that was like the only class I paid attention and pyrotechnics yeah so yeah like when I want should we keep just taking a look in this room and then move on yeah we take like a last gander around the room is there anything else of interest or is that like the main focus there's a private bath what looks like Juby a meeting room in a bureau and stacks and stacks of bookshelves containing all manner of spell books rare tomes and other statues and artifacts if I become Archmage of this tower you guys are invited up here anytime I want the years for fun yeah yes that's one already other than that they're just books and I use a tub as often as I can no you use my brain drinking water do you want to continue looking around through the through the chambers or do you want to proceed elsewhere I think we should proceed to the Nexus go to the Nexus up in that way I pet the hands like good job guys you waited so patiently I'm ready the hands give you a thumb up yeah you proceed up the stairs that reconnect back up to a grand hallway leading towards the Nexus you are in a chamber where the all the pathways converge the stairs and the elevators there is a great fountain that is carved in the shape of several dragons and instead of breathing out water the dragons are breathing out their elemental types so the it is a fountain of lightning fire ice poison and acid that is all converging around but when it hits the pool it all turns into water again Cluedo don't drink from the fountain look what if I want to drink one of them like the acid one what if I'm like really or poison I can drink poison are we still immune are we still here oh yeah here it would still be in effect yet drink the poison before you is a scene of carnage there the grand double doors leading into the Nexus it's a short set of stairs that lead up to it The Doors have been blown open and you can hear the crackling noises and the whirling maelstrom of the chamber within looking through the doors you can see that all manner of oscar yarns constructs lie battered and destroyed on the or in in the nexus chamber and looking into the chamber as you pass through the doors it is a massive dome-like chamber that much must stretch up easily the like it is easily the last 70 to 100 feet of the the tower itself it is a huge chamber and it reaches up and then comes up to the final the kind of reaches up in this kind of geometric angled dome at the very top of the the whole thing so it's not a curved dome itself it's almost like the it goes straight up and then comes in at 45-degree angles along the edges before being a straight top and there are these great pillars that reach up all along the way and between all the pillars are these shards what are evidently the windows looking out across the entire city several of them have been broken away and as you look in you can see that there is a staircase and an arching bridge leading into a central massive large pedestal in the center of the room button tell you and but it's difficult to see what else is in the room until you actually walk through the doors there is all manner of crackling energy and sweeping winds howling in the in the chamber essentially around some sort of point or focusing lens which Sebastian had seen earlier and the undead creatures of Oscar urine lie scattered and destroyed around the base guys I think we're going to raise these whether they're enough to raise three of them you would need to retrieve them oh there's in the room they're in the room nothing else is the threshold very obvious like where the door is it just immediately becomes windy and in fact the it wisps out and crackles out from the doorway itself it isn't entirely contained within within there so even there's several of these undead creatures have been destroyed just outside it as well the the crackling energy howls through the area and it looks like several of the creatures were able to progress inside the chamber but eventually something destroyed them utterly and completely can I take my rope and try like are they close enough that I can try to like fish them out of the room with a rope you would need to noose them and drag them by the neck or something like that or even throw a grapple and just hold it I borrow the end of your grapple shot you can't use that on lots of drag things mal no but can I just borrow it for a second sure can I take like the end of a grapple shot tied to my rope and try to just throw a hook onto them drag them out yeah it takes a lot of work but you are able to grapple several bodies there are more than just Oscar yarns dead in here there are the bodies of several other dead mages oh you want them yeah we want the mages okay once I pulled out enough you know can I read from the scroll yes I'm just gonna ask you as you mentioned this before did you want these ones or do you want to go for the librarian and the Archmage hmm the Archmage is further into the chamber to be tip thank you I feel like the librarian would be good did the ropes get it that affected or anything by the space yeah when I throw the rope in does anything happen to the rope or does the whole thing just um you throw the rope in and make and it gets swept up in the wind and so it takes several attempts for you actually hit one of the bodies but you are able able to use it under some and and at a few points the the bolt the the grapple head gets hit by a bolt of lightning that comes out from from the storm and it and and you are able like it doesn't channel along the rope because the rope is not conductive but you it does get caught up in the environmental effects that are there the winds seem very very heavy and these strikes lightning and arcane energy seem random and erratic can we see the Archmage from the doorway from the doorway you can see that at the heart of the Nexus is a great the great base of the focusing lens so these there are these massive glass lenses and all and in many ways the lenses are very much reminiscent of the astrolabes and the Archmage's chambers they're on gears and massive pieces and they can be focused in different orders around this central orb in the middle of this massive pedestal and before the pedestal is a smaller control pedestal as well that is covered in our glittering arcane runes that are crackling with erotic energy and they're like her body is floating in the mouse drum itself near the pedestal is what remains of the of the Archmage and you can see that her her hands have been clawed off but the rest of her body is still floating up and about even though parts of it have been torn away gluto like something got in there and took her hands so I mean I could probably go in there and know I think that when her hands were taken perhaps the removing of the staff of power from her caused them but how's your arm feeling good think you can throw this grapple far enough to catch her is that a challenge what's the range on the she's about 80 feet into the room and I have a 50 foot of rope I have also we got to tie a good knot who's the best at not tying gluto I did some sealing what would it be for knot tying well we'll just have to hand if we lose this rope I mean okay we've already gotten enough bodies out here to do it yeah yes it's so I'm pretty good at ropes and tie knots okay yeah between the three of us we can figure it out we tie two of the ropes together okay and I hand them over to Pluto may your aim be true tonight attach it to an arrow and like shoo did it yeah can we just you can use shooter in the leg or something all right untie the graph like arrow and I put it in my longbow and I shoot it towards her leg sorry it is soft and squishy that'll take a matter about the chirps here I probably don't need to sharpshooter here known for accuracy 26 it hits hits her in the leg and it is held steady but and we all just start both and as you you you pull the the body backing and as you do so you can hear a voice cry out you Defiler you sick twisted man you what are you doing still dredging up my remains and the vortex in the room begins to coalesce into the massive for a moment into this massive this angry face and it sweeps around and coalesce is around the the core of the Nexus into a wraith like figure of the the Archmage crying out in fury wait wait wait we're not Oscar we're at old Oscar we're astronomers and we just want to we're trying to get you out of this storm tell her who your mom is I am the son of the previous Archmage Lenin Lenin Eventide I am I 11 I'm Lennis son her face shifts for a moment as a strange recognition comes over her features and that is where we're gonna take a break and we are back from our break big shadow to

where you can discuss role-playing games and all the other cool nerdy things we talk about Drakken hime and D&D and video games and all that stuff so come and hang out with that let's return to the ruins the ghastly visage of the Archmage straitens as you are still like kind of holding it we're not losing and she she floats back down to the ground and the arcane energies swirling about calm for a moment it's like being in the eye of the storm of her hurricane uh-huh there's still like the loud rumble in the background of all the energy and she says you are Lenna Eventide son yes I've come to reclaim the tower in her name and predict and for the Academy and for attractive voice no we know it should bring up Lenna 'the Eventide has been dead for how long has it been 50 no I'm older than him alright no wait yeah she died in childbirth so about how old am I how many birthdays have I had nobody celebrated my birthdays I'm in my late twenties Eldrick was my fav to me that you are her her child I pull out the staff of power and my mom's spell book and I hold them up at the door make your persuasion check with advantage twenty-eight something horrible has happened here I could see that come into the Nexus if I do well like will I die I don't know oh I did then why should I come in you have the staff of power it's broken there's been an incident with the staff this tower has become a place of madness but we might be able to do something about it would you be mad if we brought you back to help I can reanimate you or is that she is steps own you would just be turning my body into a mockery I've been cleft in Twain body and soul that is just flesh nothing else okay so we don't need her do you do we still need to let will be a bit late let let the Rope go just let her let her float the body floats up in the air you wish to restore this place yeah we have a broken staff but it's my understanding that I might be able to channel the power through multiple people to try to come the Nexus down and reset it is that what the Morgan I mean the more magical the better I have I remember that day shook through the tower I was here all I could do was grip the staff and hold the energies together hold this place together I have been fighting so hard for so long to keep this place but we can keep it longer we can do it do you wear rings boy I am told that I am of the level of a five ring spellcaster but I have not been granted my rings yet and your friends this one does simple magic this one is skilled at slaying mages but he has no magical skills himself he's strong in her time yes he's a strong everything's at home you have the staff I have what's left of it and I hold up both halves of it my rings oh yeah I have did we take did you I thought you did I have other hands do we take Oscars hands we we took Oscars hands but we didn't take Oscars in new hands oh wait hands your hands are downstairs oh we forgot your hand I remember he came that man that malfeasant I banished him I remember his face he tried to he took my hands before I would not let him come near the Nexus he was mean we took care of him not a nice person he's God very well the Rings are just metal you have the staff come should I raise more bodies up I can raise a few extra conduits dead flesh will help us not okay we need it but a strong spirit will I feel strong you feeling strong I do a couple push-ups mm-hmm guys I pull out the staff of power in one hand and I reach out my other hand to grab whoever's closest to me and then you reach out to grab Bao's hand and I start to walk into the room hold off power up she the ghost still we're in the tattered Archmage's robes she says I'm squeezed in real tight do you have the shards of the staff broken yeah dump out the bag and she's she she looks down at them and the shards of the staff float in line with each other and she puts her hands on them and these spectra and this the the parts of it that are broken or the shards are gone she fills them in with it like this spectral energy fills them in and she gestures for you to keep carrying it forward towards the pedestal I keep moving towards the pedestal we're all moving yeah linking she's going keep going across this will hurt oh my god you should do what you need to do now guys I have a potion of invulnerability do you think that will help do you have one - I do that I'm sorry do you want it I don't even think I want to use it do I want to use it I'm gonna drink my potion of invulnerability you're gonna be the conduit we're just yeah that's what I'm figuring is I'm at the forefront so I down a potion of invulnerability I grab the staff and I approach okay she says when we do this there is a tear in our world here and in order to close this tear and start the Nexus they will be able to open again are you ready and the great words beings of other worlds will try to stop us my name is sebastian crowe and i was born ready and i hold the staff out and i grew dramatically okay she places her her spectral hands on it and and as you hold the staff towards the pedestal it kind of twists upwards and this receptacle appears that locks in and around the staff and so the staff is being held level towards it and the receptive the the pillar rises up locks in around that and all of a sudden these four orbs come up out of the larger base of the pedestal so as you come up onto the bridge where the pedestal is there is this crack in the floor around you where this vortex of arcane energy is kind of swirling around and you look down at the shimmering waters underneath and it is just a wash in octarine color like a little lake of octarine cradled out and then these as you come close to the nexus point these four orbs rise up out of the pet of the large pedestal and the great rings of the nexus begin to turn and rotate around each other and lock into place and these beams originated from the orbs and they bounced through the various lenses and this almost like this dreamcatcher of arcane energy it starts pulling in this mau strim that is around that is the Archmage herself and it begins to rotate around and this crackling energy just appears everywhere and all of a sudden you hear this ripping noise like reality itself is tearing open and one of the great glass windows shatters out and as it does the spilling of reality itself spills out into the room and the shards of glass begin to fly around and as it opens up all of from it spill out these gears and mechanical pieces and about a dozen mode wrongs just spill out of it and fall down on on the ground and they all begin screaming 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 and 1 0 1 1 as as they begin screaming the small circular spherical ones fly out and begin flying around but then these larger ones that look like two cubes with wings coming out of them fly out of the rift and then another smaller rift appears and in the shower of gears this thing that looks like a giant flower on five legs falls out with a lump and another one falls out and another one does and as they begin to fall out of the the rifts as well another set of rifts open up as well and from them just appear this cloud of bubbles of butterflies and an elephant that explodes into smaller elephants that explode into smaller elephants that explode into smaller elephants that explode into smaller elephants and as the puddle of elephants falls on the ground the postulates mass of flesh gathers together into this lumbering blue skinned creature it is massive almost eight feet tall with gigantic claws and a huge MA and as it forms itself the mode Ron start going zero and they start attacking it and it starts fighting them and more of these creatures begin appearing as crackles of energy fly around all through the air roll for initiative what what so we tore a little piece of reality open is now a good time to mention that I'm very low on magical powers you're holding a snap at power what's the looser swinging it [Music] I'm like we need to take one of these cube ones uh yeah we're gonna take one of these Cubans home they're gonna be like that's like the bottom of the priority list right now so all the mo drones are helping against the blue guys so he said oh man okay what do we got what do we got I got a 15-8 17 I mean you're at the bottom of the line make sense that's it's a pretty shocking situation to be it it's a big space I'm happy about it so are you holding the staff anymore or did it leave your hand and go into it's like mode I'm still holding it okay actually do I need to keep holding it I don't know I'm thinking like just going to pass Archmage hey swirling vortex is it self sufficient yet a little here yeah are you just gonna do your own thing or okay [Music] so don't worry you're invulnerable I'm analyzing it so many options right now oh yeah I'm invulnerable half damage from everything cool okay so the creatures that appear howl with rage and Madara says that is a slotty those are mode runs they will fight each other but they will all try to stop us for what we do is an offense to both chaos and law Oh quick question do I keep have to I have to hold the staff here the whole time one of you needs to hold the staff at all times and at the end of the round here's what will happen whoever is holding the staff will be able to make an ability check to control the neck in the Nexus then because the staff is broken there will be a backlash of energy that damage will be spread amongst everyone who is holding the staff at the end of the round so as long as you are touching the staff you can share in that damage does that count if we hold a bad they also share in the damage you can only do this willingly okay okay the start of the round the slot II the massive hulking creature forms beside beside you it is gigantic in nature and it sees one of the orbs in front of it and it takes its massive fists and these claws come out of its hands and it begins smashing the orb like the ones that came out of this giant blue creature no I'd you it smashes at the orb crashes into it with its fists and begins bashing in on onto one of the orbs and he deals about 20 points of damage to it as he smashes into it and cracks begin to begin to appear on it as he brit as he attacks it the other slot rushes towards one of these massive petal-like mode ron's and begins to crack as to again take its fists and start trying to tear it apart and attacking it Pluto you are up heeding the advice of the Archmage I'm gonna let go of Pluto and Vale for now Ashton yes I'm Pluto you're Sebastian I'm a fighter and I'm gonna try to jump this acid okay and and rush the slot it's a pool of octarine liquid what it actually is you probably don't want to read it like acid okay you leap across towards the creature and I'm gonna pull out flame tongue or not flame tongue as I do I call out its command word and strike it as hard as I can as hard as I can as hard as I can getting a twenty nine to hit a twenty nine that is a hit not really great on the damage only to fire damage and thirteen regular damage okay and then I'm gonna swing at it again getting a 22 also a hit for 11 regular and 9 fire okay whoo you carve into this creature and as you slash into its body the the wounds open up and a bunch of buckets pour it like buckets yeah just a ton of buckets just miniature buckets fall out of instead of blood I my brain Oh guys they're made of buckets what do they week 2 holes what do they made oh um are the gente drones the gente drones spur into action and the the leap up in the air spinning like a top and one crashes up onto the platform beside Sebastian and Vey oh yeah the far one and it spins all of its arms around and it smashes into vayo twice and Sebastian three times with its arms Oh so they oh I get a twenty three and a nine against you one hunts and Sebastian I get a 23 a nine and a 22 to hit you to hit one okay so Sebastian you take a total of ten points of damage and lay out you take eight points of damage as it rears back and as it spins you around with its peddle like arms the metal plates that that compose the flower-like of its petal each have an eyeball that look at you disapprovingly and cry out zero zero zero zero zero as it smacks into you one of the other the other Penta drone smashes into the slot several times actually scoring a critical hit against it and fights back against the the slot dealing some damage to it and the final Penta drone it it rushes around over toward it runs around the side of the area jumping across the no not that one the far one and it runs up to Pluto and the other slot yeah hello and it it makes three of its attacks on pollute oh just roaring a critical hit now which you're immune to and two misses and then it attacks and hits the slot once as well so pollute oh you take seven points of bludgeoning damage and the slot also takes some damage as well Sebastian it is your turn as you focus your energies in here you sense that you might be able to while you're doing the stole you might be able to draw on the magic of the staff of power it's a cast staff of power spells yes however if you do so that would be siphoning away the or you could refocus your energy back into it so you have your choice if you want you can cast one of you give up one of your own spell slots and this will give you advantage on the check to control the staff at control the Nexus at the end of the round if you want to cast a spell from the staff of power you can do so but if you do so I will raise the difficulty class by five that you must make on the Arcana check to control the Nexus can I also just cast a spell and continue holding this yes okay I will keep all of that in mind so I keep one hand on the staff and I rifle through my bag and I pull out one of my scrolls and I spin it out and I hold it and I start chanting the words on it turning around you do cone of cold and those I'm gonna do cone of cold hitting one two three four I'm actually maybe five can you do that in such a way that you don't hit all your friends yeah day I was under that template or is she okay looks good so five of them have to make saves against cone of cold the the first two the Penta drone and the duo duo drone both fail and the three mono drones one of the mono drones makes it saving throw alright so that is eight days I have tutor so you pull up the scroll and you cast kind of cold from the scroll okay and I'm going to use can I use yeah I can use yep you can use so three points on sorcery point to reroll three of those cool well one of them got matter all right math time [Music] [Music] 39 okay the motor ons are frozen solid and shatter into pieces [Music] oh wow you did quite the number there they shatter into pieces in are destroyed by the mighty cone of cold anything else Sebastian I throw aside the used up scroll and I put both hands back on the staff and continue focusing on okay showing it the quadrants the quadrants fluttering in the air take back their bows and each of them gets to make four short box well and so all of you get shot four times Sebastian I get a third I'll start with veo a Vale again 13 and 8 nope and Wow a six and an eleven nope Sebastian I get a 19 and a eight and then 18 and a nine yeah to hit for a total of 11 points sorry 14 points of piercing damage what's happening and Pluto I get a natural 1 and a 7 and a 14 and a nut and a 19 they all just they just all bounce off okay some of them like land in the shield that I'm not even paying attention to okay Vale you are up alright I take a step towards Sebastian I aim my bow for three shots on my long bow at the big blue ugly guy alrighty alright let's do this ah 22 that is a hits a good one 42 42 there we go okay that is around the board okay yeah so as the arrow pierces through the slot and comes out out of its back a flutter of balloons accompany the arrow as it goes out the other side and it floats away and then all the balloons pop for now pop pop ii chartered 14 that is a miss it deflected as the as the arrow goes through the slide a hole appears in the slot and the arrow just goes straight through it and then 23 that is a hit there it is for 25 damage the arrow come strikes into the the slot and as it does so the arrow smashes apart and form several mathematical formulas before disintegrating oh and then I put my hand on Sebastian okay I'm here for you ain't running away this time alright the remaining mode Ron's I just have one Oh the remaining motor on and there's one away over there okay the two of them fly one towards Sebastian one towards veo and the mono drones each they try to smash you with their spindly little hands alright yes at a getting a 20 against veo and a 16 against Sebastian a cash shield wait I might not be able yeah I don't cast you okay Sebastian you take two points of piercing damage and veo you take four points of piercing damage as they punch you with their little spindly fingers zero zero and I'm trying to use like my tail to like swat it away I'm like okay wow it is the end of the round how many of you are touching the staff two of us okay so a surge of arcane energy flies through the chamber and Channel through the broken staff the two of you are holding it along with Madera you will there are now Sebastian yeah you can make an arc on a check or use your spell casting ability modifier because this is the this is actually your raw spell cast can I keep that role okay hold on a sec okay well it was it was a toy okay okay cuz the hosts awesome okay so you drive in the staff of power and focus all of your arcane power into it and there is a smash of energy and since you've roll the natural twenty yeah you may choose one of the three bonus options okay first first of all you may choose you can feel in this moment that there are more rifts of arcane energy about to open up and you feel the connection to at least six different planes coming in your mind if you wish I will tell you those six different planes and you may choose which plane a rift opens to and creatures will spill out from this is how the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man or or you may choose for this round to negate all the damage that you will that you will all suffer from the bolt or you may now for free cast a spell from the staff of power oh man okay if I choose to negate does a bit of random portals gonna random portals gonna open up [Music] where is my spell list for staff of power yeah I was looking at it to choose which spellers at random spell I am going to I don't mind taking them globe of invulnerability what does that do makes you it blocks all spells of sixth level and lower I'm going to take this opportunity to cast a spell for free from the staff okay and it's gonna be another cone of cold and ie it's kind of this way alrighty so I don't I think this guy escapes okay but one two three four five all of these guys thanks alrighty so the slot yeah gets a twelve which fails the Penta drone succeeds with a nineteen the to line ones one gets a crit and succeeds the other fails and the duo drones one succeeds so half of all the mode Ron's succeeded and then and the slod failed 31:31 damage that destroys one of the flying ones and one of the duo drones so one of the quadroons and one of the duo drones are destroyed thus 31 damage to the slobs and it does damage to thee and the other ones are all bloodied by that awesome yep Wow nice okay it is the end of the round and you have how much damage do I think all right good a total of a total of 10 d6 psychic damage is dealt this round okay how many dice would you each like to take and you can Shen you can also say some to take some to Madera yep and all of you have to you have to take at least two each I think but you can take more if you want to she takes two you take two take six I'll take six okay cuz that'll be like three yeah that's okay oh you take ten points of psychic damage Madera takes ten and Sebastian you takes [Music] you take 25 points of psychic damage have okay buy the potion of invulnerability that's a good drink okay top of the round and rifts open up whoo which of you would write to roll a d6 to determine where rifts open up from 5:5 a rift from the elemental chaos rips open rola d4 and let's find out what kind of elemental comes through you need to avail Oh water fire air one an earth elemental steps through this is fine everything's fine cuz I killed Oscar element already an earth elemental reaches up from the from the the portals and it's a it will be acting at the end of the round these slotty the slod attacks viciously into pollute oh hi making two attacks with its bite with its claws and one with its bite it gets a 26 and a 14 to hit with its claws 26 hits and then 11 to hit with its bite yeah okay the claw deals 10 points of slashing damage and you need to make a constitution saving throw oh oh no I get a 15 that is a success oh okay the other slot smashes apart the Penta drone with its first claw attack and its bite and then it leaps up onto the plat then it rushes forward towards the other duo drone and smashes it apart someone on the ground to the Dooley drone it destroys both okay so it's running around killing everything okay fine it's fine and you can take the flying stand away can I use this opportunity to repost his 14 yes I get a 26 to hit that is a hit for 14 damage of regular damage and 10 fire okay that with that riposte he is cleft in twain yes and collapses into a shower of musical instruments my brain can't comprehend everything that's happening so I just have a musical instruments then all grow legs and eyes and run away before exploding into fireworks I scream a very manly Caspian battle cry okay sound like a little Europe and then and then I turn around and I jump back over the acid or the octarine i Kyle take the opportunity attack if he hates one he gets an 18 to hit miss it deflects off my shield as I haphazardly jump back over and then I run through my friends and I run directly at the earth elemental okay and I yell Ignatius and I'm gonna use a 18 to hit 22 hits are added to his 11 24 17 regular damage and six fire damage nice and then I'm gonna hit him again I hit him again and I just start wailing on this ah and I miss dry dramatically oh and I'm gonna use my bonus action to try to shove him back away from us okay because I'm super strong I get a 25 to not I don't the earth is unmoved the earth remains its occasion to it and then it pops so the Penta drone only one remains and it hurt it bends down like a bends over to open up all of its petals and all the mouths on the petals exhale this spray of pollen and gas and all of you need to make Constitution saving throws against poison it is not poison it is a paralysis gas Constitution say yeah up for 24 though you're paralyzed for one minute Oh two of you are

with that I'm also going to what else do I have here [Music] can I quick in a scroll or only one of my own spells only one of your own spouse okay because you're still using an item when you use this roll yeah you said I could also use one of my spell slots - was there something about like supercharging the if you want to spend one of your own spell slots you can supercharge the staff and gain advantage on your next role to control I'm going to do that okay what so you're gonna quicken the spell and use it to supercharge yes okay gaining advantage on the next roll to control and then my fire elemental will attack the earth elemental yeah yes elemental combat in like the place of dreams where people are bleeding instruments and fireworks and buckets and balloons I got a 20 that is a hit and I do 8 damage Oh 11 damage 11 damage okay and my second attack well 8 to hit that is a miss yeah the fire elemental crashes itself against the earth elemental and bits of lava are formed as

infected with some kind of like tail thing I'm gonna action surge okay I'm gonna run to vo vo the ointment does it know I was gonna use that on you does it solve paralyzation the ointment how many doses of that you think one left one left it's it it boy and it cures any disease so it does not restore paralysis then I'm gonna run back over okay it does cure diseases of which you are infected with one yourself I'll worry about that later okay so youth action surge what are you gonna do I'm gonna run back over to the I'm gonna just turn them back around to the earth elemental and start swinging because it's got to die up the jar and read the instructions no way nope oh I'll need this later that's for later times for now we got to deal with this 29 to hit 29 to hit the earth

halter okay point yeah that's it okay we now go there's no more remaining mo dry and take it d you're holding mini Isaac the earth elemental is going to smash into the fire elemental it hits the fire elemental once for 14 points of bludgeoning damage he's fine and the Nexus fires right up and I get advantage okay cuz I gave up my spell slot what is that that is a [ __ ] Dynamix like a [ __ ] dynami well how did it how did it [ __ ] on your rolling high thing they're magic okay good wonderful plus Arcana so 25 that is the success the Nexus crackles with energy and a final burst of power reverberates out how are you spreading the damage out are you still touching me yeah but I don't have a lot left so I give you one you can give me one one wait we have to take two yes take at least two I can take two - well am i die yeah you take six points of damage okay I can take lots I can take lots I'm strong so you're for Pluto - for Pluto yeah and you want to take I'll take the rest you want to take the remaining four what about those Oh madera has to take two as well well Derek can take two as well thank you I'll take four I'll take four but then I don't take you know you know you still think to her - yeah okay let's do that okay you take six points Pluto you take you take 18 mm-hm and Madera takes seven and she shudders all the way through there is a crash of energy and the rifts seal closed and the Maelstrom begins to stabilize Madera says we've done it the Nexus is secure I can I can rest now and the power of the Maelstrom crashes around and the elemental creatures and the motor ons are banished back to their planes oh man we're all holding each other like looking around like we imagine that as the males the the Maelstrom kind of falls and everything disappears at the same time that crashes we all kind of fall over in a heap on the ground and are just like laying you get a single check under 25 I don't think so that was the DC to control the Nexus nice nailed it it was super high I run over to Pluto and I start slathering not wingman on your arm just there's something still inside me is it it is cured by the ointment does it come out of him it it does it comes out of the sands you slather the ointment it how it goes starts going up your arm you kind of slather it to cover it and then eventually it comes out your nose and starts getting away like like a slug and then it bubbles up and over and turns in and bubbles up and then it sprouts a rose which then opens up and a bunch of bees fly out and then the bees start crea start weaving a basket which then disintegrates and the bees disappear I hate this place how was in me that was in me for a minute really I just want to lay down for a bit I put my hand and I was like by the way we controlled the Nexus psychically Nexus is secured as Madera look looks it looks to award you and she says there's before I go if you are indeed lana the Eventide son i will give you this as one last gift and as her spirit fades she is drawn into the staff of power and the ectoplasm seals across the broken parts of the staff of power and holds it back in place and together the staff of power is intact however because it is broken until it is fully repaired any time you use any of its charges it cut or use any spells from it it causes a wild magic search so a bonus so you it's a better staff of you have to high role every time and everything's gonna be fine oh man do I replace my wand of fear with the staff of power the room goes quiet wizard we like have a nap up here that are you a second you know I mean how many yelling potions to go so long usually we found a bunch in Oscars thing so anybody needs one that one years yeah I'm again like I'm back down to being you know grinders 20 you're right graters time yeah I can give you each greater healing potion that'd be great and how much did the ointment give me 18 oh wow yeah yeah thank you that was a good call in the ointment there thank you anytime I got you guys backs I something except for when I get paralyzed and fall to the ground I really thought I could try to save you that's fine you tried it's good I try to keep everything kept hitting you and I feel really responsible like a nightmare you just like can't move and things are like hating you and shooting at you and poking you yeah I never want to go through that dream again [Music] I'll check are you there I'm here the Nexus is secured you did it yes fashion is very very good in his magic you should give him more rings yeah he needs like 9 more rings I need at least 15 rings kind of a 20 ring wizard I don't know how you did it but it was remarkable well done boy thank you oh no it's done now I still have to make my way to the basement and we've got to secure that and then you guys can probably teleport in here but the Nexus is secured I don't know if you've ever been in a Nexus but it was it was weird man maybe I saw things there were balloons and fireworks and buckets we can see these things I'll drink a beehive with since I can arrange for you to visit a mind mage they can erase yeah I mean just forget like 90% I saw everything I saw the real truth I've seen so much of the universe in the past 24 hours I don't think I'll be okay the real truth is bees is there's more to this world than any of us truly knows well I know more of it now the need that believed that the mortal mind can truly comprehend it is a lucky fool is there anything else that I should be doing up here or should I make my way to the basement next if you have reset the Nexus see now it from there if you can connect your consciousness to it and you may be able from here to allow us to teleport to the Nexus directly whoa okay I'll just go ahead and plug my consciousness in shouldn't be a problem there's give me a second I got thing on the back or something yeah okay 20 rings I take the staff of power and I put it onto the Nexus one more time and I do my best to focus my consciousness it is much like touching the orb feel yourself drawn up through the world and through the tower oh god here we go for a moment you become a spy and may become aware of everything in the tower so it's like the the whole tower and its entire layout which extends impossibly in all directions is where you are aware of it and the several things come to your mind as you do so the idea is like defense control expand contemplate look see these concepts that you could tap into but as you get close to them you feel the limits of your own power almost prevent you from fully grasping what the tower is capable of doing as if basically the best way to describe it is it's like you're trying to lift a weight that is too heavy for you but the the thing that you can tap into is you see where the teleportation chambers are at the bottom and your consciousness can kind of flood towards that and there's this notion of releasing what the way that it is set to open it back up to be received again do you want to do that yes I do okay I focus all of my energies on releasing that at that aspect there and opening it up there is a crack you and your mind jumps back to the moment and you're holding the staff the portal room is open again I think I did it I saw through time and space traveled multi-dimensional rifts saw beyond life itself and I think you guys can come visit all right meet us downstairs yeah sure yeah our way yeah we'll just go down guys there's do you wanna yeah beyo do you want to have a fun way down are we jumping down the elevator shaft yeah is it elevator shaft er you you want to go outside I mean I'd rather said the elevator shot can take us right down to the basement straight down all right I flew down there with my eyes wait don't we go through the Maelstrom we if we take the same elevator shaft I threw down I flew my eye down it so it's safe but you followed the the rope ladder not on my way down I went through an elevator shaft to go all the way to the basement so the elevator shaft goes all the way down conceivably yeah you want a feather fall down yeah okay it is extremely fun yeah yeah who can get down there first and I like the pull wires behind me and like dive face-first something yet not really enjoying it I'm just I'm enjoying being a buck spinning I spin you spin me okay the as you arrived down at the base level of the tower and head back to where the teleport we're now you know the teleportation chamber is it's almost like now you have a sense for the whole layout of the main rooms of the tower now that you've attuned to the Nexus you come down to this great chamber and it's that chamber where there was the strange archway that winked out the arcane eye and the doors on the other side of that are now open and on the other side of it is this massive chamber that's circular in size and has a large teleportation circle in the middle and all around the room on the each there's four massive iron golems with their arms crossed flanking the teleportation circle I hold up the staff of power as I walk in and I go hey guys boss is here just letting some people in they relaxed onto the walls and there is and as you step into the room there is a crackling of arcane energy and a portal begins to open up it looks like there might be something like as it does so it's very clearly like struggling to lock on to its position as if it's winking in and out and the still the disruption of the haze is making it difficult for that to do so as you look down as well you can see these scrambled remains of what looks like a previous group of amethyst academy mages that try to teleport here years ago in the middle of the teleportation chamber what do you want to do can I like try to use the stuff power to focus and help them through making our kind of check 23 you use it to guide the portal open and before you appear Eldrick River and six other robe mages of the amethyst Academy and after they come through I kind of slump over onto the staff pretty drained and exhausted good to see you guys you have done very well says Eldrick very very well I could not have a above and beyond you know if the rest of the tower is safe it's as safe as I can tell we got rid of a lot of undead Oscar yarn and the other mages we've secured the Nexus we've been through pretty much every floor of this place other than the weird traps and hazards of the tower itself I think it's safe to say that it's relatively secure I do have a favor to ask aldrick yes indeed this staff has helped out a lot with this tower I think it could help out further you asked for it I'm willing to give it to you but if you think I could borrow it for a while Eldrick looks at the others we will have to deliberate over that I am sorry to say you've done well but let me introduce you to the others he gestures you to the other mages that are about the the chamber here and for another six of them they're all clad in the robes of the amethyst Academy and mean one of them holds a staff of similar construction to the staff of power in fact it may be very well be another staff of power itself and he introduces the group of you to the to them and I just have to get my list of all the names how's everybody doing after renegotiate our salaries after this we did a good job maybe should get some extra hazard pay because um my mind is broken if you can make amethyst academy robes in a coat like fashion black and purple yeah he says he introduces you to them one by one they said at first to a platinum haired elven woman and she and he introduces her this is Messiah nether wind master of evocation this he points to a small gnomish woman and he says this is Grandmaster noodles master of

this because we knew you would need it we didn't know we don't know what the state of the accommodations here will be so he unfurls the scroll and reads from it and a doorway appears in front of him

food throw it in my mouth you have all you have successfully re-captured the Tower of the amethyst Academy you all level up [Music] long rest oh thank goodness long rest thank you feels so much better oh man now I'm like equal rogue and Ranger what does that make me nope that doesn't work Ranger and Rogin equal measure you guys know what you're gonna take for level 10 I haven't really thought what are you each of you gain when you level up I get uncanny dodge you're gonna use that a lot y'all get a new meta magic ooh what's it gonna be it's gonna be is it gonna be III had to guess I'd say you're you're torn between subtle spell and twin spells absolutely torn between those two I have to decide in this moment if I'm going combat-ready or infiltration ready well you got a week to think about that I do what do you gain some new maneuvers as well as my superiority dice are now a d-10 do fighters get a new abilities who are increase your feed at level 10 or does that not happen again to level 14 oh good question I think at 12 okay yeah so so you get some new maneuvers though yeah and I can always switch some out to I think one per level or one per you got some thinking to decide on so new some new moves yeah spells I'm checking to see how long thinks I think I got a new spell last time but if I do I'll let y'all know mmm very very freaky yeah I don't think you learn a new spell at level 5 as an arcane trickster no no I don't everything new to get 1/6 contra I think it takes a couple you get a sixth can't rip says here I got a six can't rip in another spell sweet yeah sweet well um with that I think you all have lots of thinking and decisions to make about how you're gonna level up yeah what is the next step what was after the are we just can we have our sit around the the fireplace like all in our bathrobes like drinking yes I mean we're just like kind of pondering the non-id like taking this the unseen servants bring you some cocktails Jr Jones is supposed to meet us back at the hooded lantern scare mm-hmm and I have to send a message to Eric I still haven't done that yet I think the next thing we need to do is start to establish our army dragon hunt which is going to be the amethyst Academy caspia if we can get Jupiter Jones you and any of the men that you guys have at your disposal mm-hmm your father who is in which cross cambering yeah or yeah your other father yeah family yeah he's my father's partner a while ago okay yeah smile yes other feller okay yeah yeah we're gonna we're gonna bring Eric we're gonna bring Eric and maybe he can bring some people to to Drakon Haim and we can all converge under the hood at lanterns bat banner yeah does that sound like a reasonable way to start building a her car track and I'm yes that's that's an idea that's our our Strikeforce and then Jack Reeves for the queen of Jack and forest at the highest level we we do have to deal with her we we're gonna sit down and we're gonna chat for a while but that's kind of the gist of the idea on where we plan to direct our movements next so assemble a coalition take on the queen of Thieves because with her out of the picture then it's just and what are your objective what are all other anything personal for each of your characters that you want to try and try you have amassed more than any different allies have come and gone but what the read some enemies now have been slain and big ones it's at a turning point now what you'll do next in the days to come I have to commune with my mother we can contact the other plane I can do that and I actually my plan was to do that here at the amethyst or Academy using the powers of the tower to help me maybe amplify that commune with my mother so that's something that I would like to do before we leave okay I mean personally I mean I have to pet hands now maybe I'll name them come up like that's important lefty in hefty or something like that yes that's it I think we should name one of them Kyle yeah just popped into my brain Kyle and hefty Kyle and hefty okay Kyle and have to do this all righty and Pluto what is your next move now I do have to reach out to my family in caspia I have to tell them everything that's happened I'll probably skip over some of the early bits where my everyone was murdered is there a tower in kaznia yeah there's some like we were mostly bungalows but there's a few like Academy oh yeah Academy like like building that isn't a tower but it's like a there there is an Academy yeah tower in caspia the the dragon hime tower is the only tower that is in a city all the other ones are usually far they're light outside villages are further out of urban areas it's the only urban tower at least in this part of the continent I'm wondering if your family should start aligning with Academy around them it would be good to share some of their like maybe I can name drop and get them in mmm-hmm now that I know noodles hmm noodles and everyone knows master noodles and and some of the other ones the necro guy and blue the divination one where she tastes like noodles what did you just she says that and we are we both like it's gonna join like I don't eat people the hands are changing you again no no no no they're fine sit hands and I tap them with my invisible nee-chan I'm DJ don't flat alrighty well I think that is where we're gonna wrap up for the

yeah thanks very much thank you I think one of the the side perks that I think I think about this once a while and I was talking to a few people on our discord the other day about how difficult it can be to make a D&D group consistent and get together because D&D groups disintegrate and people's schedules do this and streaming this has been one of the most amazing things for keeping a D&D game consistent and so the fact that people have been enjoying the show it's like we gotta play D&D because we we got the show and it's actually been a RIT's been the real gift for us because you know none of us are professionals were we're just doing this for fun and for us we've gotten to enjoy this fantastic D&D game and share it with all of you and it's it's really hard to keep dandy going as you
