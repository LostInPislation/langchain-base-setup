by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon Highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to woo the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches but now and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of dragon hein when last we left our heroes they were making their way up the grand shattered Tower of the amethyst Academy the tallest structure in the city of Dragon Hein which was which was broken in two by the meteor when it fell on that faithful day fifteen years ago yet the structure itself still stands rent through the middle with the upper reaches of the tower still floating in space over the city in defiance of gravity our heroes have worked their way up through the lower chambers of the tower and are now heading through the various classrooms and lecture halls of the Academy but they have now found a scrying chamber in the Academy where a great orb has been set which Sebastian now plans to use to conjure an arcane AI which they can use as a magical hall monitor this is the Hall monitors pass of the amethyst Academy cool and survey the halls to see if they can find the locations of the treasures that they seek their quest now is to reclaim the tower their ultimate goal to seize the staff of power the symbol of office for the Archmage of the amethyst Academy for this tower and use it to reactivate the Nexus at the top of the tower and also to reclaim the teleportation chambers below you are in the scrying chamber the orb pulses before you in this square chamber and the runes begin to flirt up all around lit up all around in the air as you go to place your hands on it it's a large crystalline or of about a foot across on a on a twirling pedestal made of filigree silver which is clasped in place upon it and there's this railing around it and steps leading up to it that you can reach out and and then touch it and interestingly enough as well in front of the the scrying orb is a small lectern and a pen and pencil and then as you step up the steps towards the lectern one of the the chairs one of the steps lifts up and becomes a chair I did not expect this to be this comfortable unit so I sit down I roll up my sleeves alright guys gonna take a look around this tower can you guys just make sure I don't get interrupted and I'm gonna close the door I'm gonna lock it if it has like an indoor lock and then mostly just kind of lean my back into it as I observe called Sebastian here getting his ball on yeah I also go stand by the door and just like keep an ear towards it I place my hands on the orb make an intelligent saving throw his mind is shatter start I'm gonna roll the dice that failed me last time and it won't do it tonight surprise failed me in fact I got a five okay Sebastian as you place your hands on the orb you can feel a wellspring of arcane power fill through your body Sebastian's eyes turn milk-white for a moment before streaks of arcane light begin to glow from his irises and this purple energy be to go through his blood veins from his hands and up his arms and then reaching up his neck and forming these and you can actually see it almost causing the veins to bulge out around his eyes and it looks like his eyes themselves are almost gonna pop out of his skull as he holds onto the orb Sebastian you feel this wash of vertigo take over your body as your consciousness is flung up through the floors of the tower so you just feel like your body your soul is being ripped out of your body and you fly up all the through the floors of the tower up up up and you suddenly feel like you are miles and miles over the city itself looking down on the entire city until you realize that gravity is still pulling your body and you're pulled flung down through all the tower floors and in this moment you almost get a sense of the entirety of the tower of the amethyst Academy and also somehow a connection to the other towers throughout the world as well that feel almost infinite in scope and as your mind opens up to the but the arcane links across the ley lines that stretch across the globe you almost feel like you are pulled under the earth and the world turns inside out and then you are looking down upon the entire globe itself before your slingshot metaphysically back into the tower the entire process causes you to take 30 points of psychic edge what do we do I like snapback after that am I still like holding you're still holding on yeah well uh hey oh he's just doing his thing right just watch it yep you know I get electrocuted and you need like a broom you're not supposed to touch the person yourself you have like a piece of wood that we could like well like does he just look like he's just normal or is he screaming no you see screaming man these orbs look painful so the two of you you see is Sebastian is scream and spasming and like there's this froth coming out of his mouth and blood leaking at both of his nostrils I am Mei Chen and like Mei Chen - like karate chop his arms off of the thing just to see if I move his arms so I don't have to touch him okay you go to mage hand his his arm and try to try to pull it away and as the arcane force tries to pull at Sebastian mm-hmm Sebastian do you want to release your hand I'm gonna try to control it you're gonna try to control it I'm gonna try to eat in control so as you as you try to karate chop his hand away he's gonna hold on he's trying to hold on so Sebastian you can make a the two of you can make opposed Arcana checks because the hand is trying to when I get disadvantaged because I'm exhausted six seven okay Sebastian's hand barely stays in place on the orb I mean I guess he really wants to do this but yeah I don't know what to do he just really wants the magic can I try to control it you you can but it's up to these two to decide what they want to do I'm I'm worried but without a frame of reference like I just assumed this is how they've always used arcane eyes so I'm watching gleefully like I know you're bleeding and stuff but I'm like wow must be must be really hard to be a hall monitor lotta they ask a lot from you but then process is a process you know what where am I to stand in their way of their their traditions so I'm just watching big smile on my face all right Sebastian yeah you can make another intelligent saving throw uh what dice what theis am I gonna roll I'm gonna I'm gonna roll all two of them old lady like the first set of metal dice I ever bought you're not gonna let me down I'm making it an ark Anna you're making an intelligent intelligent saving throw okay thank you nineteen okay as it looks like the tower is going to take you on another loop of this extra dimensional trip solidify your mental grip over it and lock your consciousness in into the orb yeah and you are looking at yourself guys I've hacked the mainframe are you okay I'm great hmm hold on I can see me I can see you you can see but I can see all of us you can see yourself and you are suddenly aware of your own body but when you look down there's nothing there I thought if I always look this good debatable pretty handsome you're bleeding guys yeah you're not at your best right now to be honest I've looked worse I'll do some housekeeping I'll go up and like get some of the blood the blood make me beer they hear him Jenny is he talking yeah he can talk it's kind of like mumbly like he's not all there but he can talk hold on I'm gonna try to move I'm gonna try to move the I can I move the eye you can oh this is weird okay guys I'm gonna I'm gonna scout ahead okay I'm gonna go up right that's where we want to go you go where you need to go big guy all right up and then if you can go down to the basement Oh check out the teleporter yeah I leave like I I can pass through the wall other doors within the wall within the amethyst Academy this arcane eye is capable of passing through the doors of the Academy most of the doors there may be some doors that it cannot pass through but it cannot pass for the walls I I go out the door that we came in what you actually notice is that as you when you are take on this arcane eye you can see that there is a spectral peephole about one inch in diameter that you couldn't see before on the doors that is the spot that the arcane I can pass through in all the doors all right now are we are we talking to Sebastian in his body there yes so he's there in his body but mentally he is elsewhere so if I mentally talk to you through this bond am I talking to the spirit that is going around or am I talking to still you in your body I I mean I'm still in my body but I can see more Eva where is Sebastian is he there or is he there everywhere like can you hear me now I can hear me now can you hear me now I'm just working on the man here yeah I out into the hallway and the first thing I'm going to do is look to see if there's any more enemies coming okay you fly out into the halls the hallway looks clear it's still quite wet from the destroyed water elemental whoops but cleanup in aisle four all right guys coast is clear I'm making a break for the library that's where I'm gonna head to on this floor yeah that that's where the entrance to the library is and then I'm gonna head up from there so I head towards the library entrance you round the corner and you come to a long hallway a hallway that almost spans the entire length of the tower except it seems to go on forever in both directions like you look down it and as you come into the hallway it just extends and extends and it sort of begins to curve at either side you can see that there are two there's the way that you came and another way leading off of this hallway and then there are two grand sets of double doors that you can see here so again the this hallway here is curved almost perfectly circular and then there are two doors that you can see see going into it and beside each of the doors there is a large metal plate with a handle on it with a small sign that says after-hours drop box I think I found the library guys but there's a hallway here that looks really weird it goes on forever I think I'm gonna avoid that I'm just gonna go for the library sounds smart I I fly through the dot one of the sets of double doors okay the two sets of double doors one here is the first one is carved with the motif of fire and there are great creatures of flame dragons elemental creatures salamanders all echoing around this doorway the one immediately beside it is carved with depictions of creatures of elemental air which doorways would like to go to fire as you go to the fire door you can see that further down as the hallway curves there's a third doorway carved in the depiction of elemental earth you pass through the fire doorway you step into a massive rectangular chamber float but yeah metaphysically step this chamber as before doesn't quite it doesn't quite seem like the ringed hallway outside it would actually be able to contain it with the circumference of the circle but looking into the the rectangular room that you are in it is is massive it's about 120 feet on each side and 100 feet on the other so it's a rough rectangle and as you look up you can see that high above you are is a mass of crackling energy and floating rock or the tower extends all the way up here to the base of the floating tower up above and then you can see through the wreckage it continues even further past that this room is the most gigantic library you have ever seen the shelves are lined and packed with myriad books and tomes on every conceivable subject all along all the walls and then in the center of the room are two great pillars which are holding up a bridge which crosses over the span and the pillars the underside of the bridge is impossibly holding bookshelves that have books in place in defiance of gravity the sides of the bridge are lined with bookshelves and then the bridge spans two galleries that look down and all the galleries as well on that level that you can see all are filled with bookshelves the the the area in front of you the floor is covered with rubble spill books and destroyed and destroyed papers all flitter through the air over the sound of crackling energy and there are several large tables and reading rooms over which you can see the emaciated forms of several dead apprentices still clutching their like clutching book bags and a few of them looking like they were trying to run out of the room a few of them have been crushed under the rock that fell here as well and their bodies look like they have been consumed almost as if something just sucked all the water and air out of them and they're still clothed in very clearly the robes of an apprentice of the amethyst Academy you see perhaps another that might have been a senior mage one that has a corpse that has a pair of glasses and has what looks like to be some sort of rod or staff and six rings on the hand and as you look up the rest of the tower the galleries and the bridges continue in this criss cross that as they go up all the levels through the tower there's another set of bridges and galleries and there are doors where some of some of the bookshelves are stopped by doors that just come in from no direction and it continues all the way up to the top where again there are these floating pieces of rock and you can see this almost the storm of a delirium in the midst of the middle of the tower where there's crackling energy kind of residual income where the tower was broken and pieces of the meteor still floating in the air and pieces of delirium in fact there's several large pieces of delirium all scattered about on the ground here as well what you see though in this chamber along one of the bridges is a small moving creature looks like a woman that looks strangely familiar might be a halfling or unknown you recognize her as gamma Oscar your ins apprentice and she is walking across the bridge and there are climbing along the walls and up across the bookshelves there is a pack of undead of emaciated undead creatures that are clinging off of the bookshelves and climbing up and down the walls and all of them are looking at books and they they look at one and then they stuff it into a bag that they're each carrying on a sack and one or two and one or two of them are on the ground picking up pieces of delirium guys we have company company like icy mages gamma naught gamma yeah which was which was the one I chopped the arm off of I think it's the guy that was the guy that he was killed yeah we murdered him I mean unfortunately Hope Maxim yes mark oh yeah we're gonna have to come through this room but looks like there's a lot of undead here so we'll have to be prepared for that now do we want to fight them or do we want to run away from them we have to get to the top of this tower we I I actually so I move the eye so that I'm in a position where I can see gamma mmm still trying to stay far enough away that like she wouldn't notice if she had like some sort of way to see the eye where's she headed she steps out onto the bridge and you watch as she casts a spell that you recognize she's casting the levitate spell and she steps off the bridge and she floats down and walks over to one of the one of the undead creatures the ghouls gestures over to gamma to where the the one with the six rings is and she walks over to it and picks up the rod and cuts off the hand and stuffs it into a pack she's collecting items guys she found a six ringer she's taking its staff and its rings well it probably means two that if you're seeing her now and she's just collecting stuff they haven't been here for long so I'm gonna keep going up yeah Oh from where she was coming down right she cuts off the head and then she cuts off the hand and then she proceeds to cut off the head as well and stuff it into the in the bag and then it starts going down the the back and pulling out what she can of this spinal cord this is getting intense guys I'm gonna I'm gonna look for four more but I think there's a fight that we can anticipate in that room hmm I'm gonna see what else I can find and I start moving up towards the the hole in the tower okay you fly up hundreds of feet towards the breach in the middle of the tower it is the the breach itself looks like it has carved a rent that might be as much as a good like one-sixth of the length of the power has just been blown out and it is this as you raise up you can see that you can very clearly once you're up here you can see the direction the meteor shard fell through because it carves off a direction that starts that the where the library is is the low point of the rent and so it all kind of rakes up slightly towards the point where the first impact happened and it is a sea of rubble up here several buildings at least three floors of the tower are all ripped open along the top part and also along the bottom part which is crumbling away and leaning down but it's all you can almost make out as the rubble floats around in space around here and this arcane energy is visibly cracking between the two pieces as they as pieces of masonry float about and when they come close to each other sometimes they slam into each other and a bolt of lightening strikes off of them or several pieces will get close to each other and some lightning will crackle and pull them close together as if each is trying to fight for its own sense of gravity and it lets you kind of see that the furniture so floating in the air there are several corpses of members of the Academy they're full of floating dead in the air grasping at books and wands and spell books the blown apart remains of several shield guardians and other constructs that would have guarded these halls and of course a swirling flock of books the pages of the books and the books just float around the air here like birds flocking almost as if they had a little bit of a mind of their own just this is the way that they're caught in the wind which is howling up this high over the city for you are higher even than the tower at this point looking up onto several of the chambers you see that one of the chambers here has been crashed open and there is a large arcane magic circle in the center of the room and they're surrounded by several tables and a few other and two hulking undead monstrosity with machinery coming out of them is Oscar you're in math and he is going across several different tables and he is taking pieces of the mages and you can see their hands their heads these body parts of them that have been collected and he is stitching them together and he keeps turning back over to this tome that he's found that he's reading and he looks looks at the tome comes back and start stitching things around again and as he does so leading the effort in his hand he is clutching an obsidian black staff to hipped with an orb of delirium it is the staff of power that he holds guys we have work to do I I explained all that to you like I'm saying it as I'm seeing it was he he was not he was lower than the break yes he's under the mark and he's in an opening in his workshop where were in the room that he's turned into a makeshift workshop there is a rope ladder that has been strung up from that room up to the top part of the of the tower and as and another ghoul climbs down the ladder and drops off a sack of body parts so we know where Oscar is should I keep going up higher to see what's up higher in the tower or is this like we found our primary target we need to get that staff from him when you get the staff but we're using that but how long do you have on the how long on the initial di for once a day right that you can only use this spell yeah so should i I should keep going yeah keep going and look at it all and make a noise so I want to float over to the rope ladder just because I don't want to mess with like all the crazy stuff happening hmm and my assumption here is that the rope ladder has a safe passage through the disaster and so I'm going to fly over to it and just go up along the rope ladder you fly up around the rope ladder into a series of halls and chambers that look like they are meant to be the apartments living quarters and personal workshops for the highest members of the amethyst Academy here you are in a hallway of similar construction to the lower levels and there are a few of Oscar urines ghouls that are collecting bits of arcane objects and items that they have found in the halls above and assembling them together to bring them down okay is there any way up further it continues there the the elevator room is still here because it continues over but of course as you come over to it it's a similar construction as it was before the four elevators all flanking a fountain this one which has been designed with several of the creatures from the clock tower the mo drones and they are working at they're active they're working at the fountain and they are they scoop the buckets and then drop them down and scoop a bucket and then drop it down and scoop a bucket out and then drop it down there's just four of the of these circular shaped motor ons doing this and they have the ones with the wings that they scoop down into the fountain with a bucket and then drop the water back down and they're just repeating the cycle the the tower the shafts here though are empty and all continue up another couple levels I want to find the Nexus so I'm gonna keep moving up I'm like I'm like reciting this all to you boom Oh Tron's oh maybe I am at this Academy you might have some idea about the clock tower too maybe we can take the mode runs and recruit them back to the clock tower to continue fixing it and then we build more mojo yeah because I have a feeling that if these morons are being controlled by I assume Oscar is that the power does it or maybe that you can hear something auditory that like gives us more information on how to like tell them what to do mmm can I hear or am I just able to see taken you can you can hear you you have to switch between whether you believe you have to switch between hearing and seeing oh no I think you can do both let me double check because I was wondering if you could hear like any like zero one zero are they saying the same words they do at the day maybe you could get to hear some like trigger word all that maybe I should go listen to what Oscar you're insane listen in yeah it's visual information on what he knows well would he know yep I can't hear I can only see hmm yeah so I continue up who's learned head like I can't I don't have time to read lips yeah I get right in his face say about him from so I'm gonna keep going on yeah you come up to the highest part of the elevator shafts which open which only lead to a single set of double doors which have been broken open and before those double doors there are you can see that the creatures have austrians minions have made it this far but they have opened up this door and there are several destroyed creatures all broken apart at this doorway there be before the doorway is a crackling mass of swirling elemental energy up there the other side of it is a veritable maelstrom of Elemental creatures and at the center of it you can see leading up towards this is this single focusing lens upon which is gripping the Archmage and a part of her body has been ripped away the Malstrom rule continues around her completely envelope a chamber beyond in mass of this erratic arcane energy she's she's dead right half of her body has been ripped away and the and she's floating underneath this focusing lens around which is a swirling maelstrom of arcane energy you can surmise from what you know from outside that the power probably continues further up from here that you're probably looking at the base of the Nexus guys I think I found the Nexus and I found the Archmage it doesn't look appealing it's gonna be tough to get in there do you think having the staff would help probably but what's more concerning is why has an Oscar tried maybe he has there's a bunch of dead corpses here undead creatures so he's tried something and it didn't go as planned hmm it's probably awarded guys things entering I don't know if I want to fly my arcane eye into what's going on in this room I'm nervous about what effect that might have but I think this is where we need to get to after we take care of Oscar and get the stuff yeah we need them do we do the Nexus first and then do the portal yeah the portal in the basement is afterwards we need to kill Oscar we need to get the staff okay we need to go to the Nexus figure out how to activate it and then we clear out the basement flying around in the Nexus as this arcane storm swirls around it it looks to be that there are several broken bodies of other creations of Oscar yarn that hadn't swept up in the Malstrom itself and as if they've tried to enter here but this arcane energy has been tearing them apart do you guys agree that so I think we're good with this part of the tower I think I've observed everything I need to hear I'm gonna head back down yeah I think so what I want to do just to speed up this process I also want to check out the basement mm-hmm so I'm probably just if I fly into an elevator shaft can I just like say thinking I love it yeah okay so now that I've witnessed this I don't want to go in that room with the ISO I'm gonna fly back to the elevator shaft find one and just go down and fireball all the way down yeah yeah you do so you fly all the way down to the lowest level of the tower which the elevators again and a single set of double doors here so there's the elevator room itself and then a set of double doors which you can fly through and go down a set of stairs that lead to a room that has a large desk and a mist filled archway and leading up to the mist-filled arch beside the mist-filled archway is this large arcane looking contraption that looks like it has a conveyor belt attached to it and there are several boxes beside it and then a attached to the boxes is this very large pane of glass in a circular shape and a chair and there is a set of doors that lead into another room off of this chamber and the way that the chamber is built is that there is a set of railings that would lead anybody from that set of double doors would have to would walk through this archway or the other other way around and it's the archways like filled with like a mist the archway is filled with a mist and then beside the archway is this along the other side of the railing is this long table that has a leather conveyor belt along and the leads the conveyor belt leads into this large metal box that has this large circular pane of glass coming off of it and several floating arcane rooms and a chair and then the conveyor belt continues out of the other side of the box and there are several trays of wood that are resting all piled up on the one side of the conveyor belt just like an x-ray machine for luggage so it's not what you're describing right now do you put your stuff in the guys I see I said this I don't know what this is but it looks like there's something you put something in a box you put it through a machine somebody looks at it through a window and then it comes out the other end should I fly through the machine no line to the box no I'm hearing both answers okay angel and devil on your shoulder yeah give in to your desire because you're already heard okay I'm gonna I'm gonna try something else here this also doesn't seem promising but I'm gonna go for it I try to fly through the archway okay you you fly through the archway and all of a sudden there is a crackle of energy and the eyeball pops and you're shot right back into your body yeah see that was probably a bad idea good thing it wasn't your real body oh man good do you need like I mean home healing it'll sit on the stairs a lot of blood you're bleeding here let me and I pressed it did you take the blood away I don't I don't feel great but we have a couple mages to kill ah is it is it bad that I'm really excited to I think we're all excited I don't think we need a short rest okay or I can just hold on i rifle through my bag but I'm gonna drink a potion of superior healing okay that's one of the big ones how much is that the superior healing that 184 plus eight so that that's the one that does 40 no yeah you need that I need it okay yeah does anybody have like a regular healing potion like not greater cuz I don't waste that I need like small amounts of healing I mean we could take a short rest I'm just worried we know exactly where gamma and Oscar are right now yeah I have a regular if you wanna give a regular I would love a regular and that's ten right just a regular old potion of healing Cheers perfect how are you I'm fine everything's fine are you guys ready to go kill I could do a short rest now are we I can always do a short rest let's go let's go murder something I don't want to waste any time we've we've observed we spied now's our chance to get the drop on them we know where they are if I'm not mistaken how long would it have taken me like okay also I don't know I guess which side of the room was he on in terms of when you saw him can you can you minor illusion like a small diagram a painted map of like and I'm like so the upper reaches at the tower the library continues for about another seven levels so the from the bottom of the library to where the break point is mm-hmm is almost 300 feet okay and then and the yeah Sebastian couldn't hear anything well he was an arcane I although I did say a few things that you could hear but my bad but so you don't know what though the conditions for hearing will be but the and then the library goes off and then the library is the low point so you can imagine that for what Sebastian describes there's like a slope sloping down into the library part of the tower which actually continues all the way up and past the break point as well so I have a potion of flying I'm thinking if I can get above Oscar that's probably gonna be my best vantage point to be able to hide within almost like the rubble that is above him you can use the hookshot to keep in mind that we probably like from me and Pluto we're gonna have to fight our way out so we're probably gonna have to fight through gamma and a whole bunch of undead to get to Oscar what other potions did we have though I got flying I do have the ability to become a gaseous form and we have a potion of invisibility do we not yeah and I have a potion of invulnerability making me involve all no but gas you your gas you turn invisible and clunk your way through confusing everybody and you fly cuz do we have a potion of invisibility as well or you have Scrolls I have I have a scroll yeah could we make what if I just was really loud and obnoxious like normal like what if I just I walk in I'm like here Oscar Oscar Oscar and I just clang everything and when he's looking at me you guys get the jump I also I do have another idea okay that might work as part of this idea I I see where you're going and I'm gonna make it better fireworks yeah I have other fireworks okay so do you guys remember this deck of cards that I found no yeah you don't remember the guy yeah I think I can make some pretty cool stuff happen with this deck of cards I've been looking at it it's a deck of cards yeah you're gonna play some cards I'm gonna you know like throw cards at him Monte do I know what the deck of cards is it is a deck of illusions it is a deck of illusions so I've been researching this since I found it okay if I throw a card down it has to be at random but an illusion of whatever is pictured on the card appears and acts and looks fully realized I'm thinking there's two sets there's multiple sets of double doors into the library how fun would it be to just slide one of these cards under one of the sets of double doors whatever it is appears that oh no an enemy then then Pluto burst through the other double doors ignatius and then we gasp and fly although do we want to go right for Oscar should we help Pluto seal I always thinking go for Oscar before he can get the jump because he has probably gained a couple tricks from being in this building and I feel like if we don't get the jump on him right away he's gonna get a few tricks out yeah maybe I might for the whole like sneak sneak and try to get get the drop on them because we know where he is how do we get the drop on him with gamma and an army of undead between us and him I have magical like passive Oh trace that room is open they're gonna be looking like when we walk through a door yeah they'll be looking remember it's 300 feet from the bait from the floor of the library to where the breach is we're off Yanis so the the bottom levels of the library are quite a long distance from where so if we start slinging spells and combating I mean that's why if we climb up before we kill under wave is audible up to 300 feet but not necessarily everything that happens and given the amount of wind and like the conditions above it is possible that the sounds of battle will not quiet might not be immediately apparent provided the battle is not protracted so I almost think if we can burst through surprise gamma and the undead get rid of them yeah then we sneak up to Oscar there's any time it where we wait till he's like going to the bathroom or like he's like sleeping is there a way we can like he's gotta be he's got to take a break at one point you saw him working diligently like what if he that goes to take a nap like he just rest his eyes and then we burst through at the same time he might be so busy working diligently that other than Klunk Klunk over here we might be able to get a early shot on him I'm even wondering thinking about an early shot thinking about Pluto you can teleport to people better to teleport from a like attacking from above yeah what if I okay I can dimension door and as long as I keep the vision I can go 500 feet so we could go to like above how far his nest like when we walk in we could just go open above I have a feather fall so like literally we can fall I'm not gonna turn okay how cool would that okay guys I can feather fall us so we get the drop on gamma and the minions I was even thinking skip skip them I don't think there's a way to skip them yeah okay we're breaking the game yeah we have to go plus you know what as much as I want to kill Oscar and we will yeah I also want chemical and dead dead I do want to look gamma yeah dead dead um okay so then is the plan to sneakily attack gamma not cause a huge commotion and then we're gonna cause a slight commotion but not a 300-foot commotion is there something you could do to her can you like charm her or like make your like I'm like what magic do you think I am some sort of spell caster well yeah this whole time I have a few ideas because if you could lock her down can I guess run up in the hooker in the neck I also have disguise self as well that's it right there that's it do you think I could disguise myself is like as gamma haha if we kill gamma and the minions she's like two and a half feet tall she is a oh you know a Mormon to gamma and walk on your knees yeah this guy self can't change your height no but if you walk on your knees well I was thinking of being in like one of their undead zombie night myself that much I guess like an undead you're not dead and then I come in and then they're just like oh another one of them and then I don't know I could make us all look like contact what are the options what are the options we were all undead yes all undead I'm practicing do it once I don't know this if it's gonna be one that it's gonna be the time that it's gonna work but I don't know if it's a problem yeah the painting just counter spells you if we attack Oscar first what I'm worried about is that he will alert there's others and then gamma and a swarm of undead are going to come meet us when we're fighting Oscar I'd rather take Oscar on Oh like his own yeah we're less less support less support that make sense but then we'd have to really like ninja our way in and like be again we don't have to grow ninja we need to not be heard 300 feet oh no screaming and neisha question and question we'll talk about that that's sidelining that this is important its form somebody yell ignatius the the elevators do they continue up past the library they do what if we just took the elevator out we just take the elevator up Bing and then we just walk down and murder Oscar start from the top work our way down into his larynx still again you know the elevators break at the breakpoint as well oh yeah and so we're the breakpoints right where he is right and so you may be able to take now the elevators from what you remember it with Sebastien's you using one the one that's functional doesn't go it the shaft continues but the elevator itself doesn't serve the top those high floors but there are there is the broken shaft that is crackling with lightning that does go all the way up we just climb up the murder elevator and we're free and clear how high are you gonna climb I as high as I need to or we could I could teleport up the shaft that to the very top hmm and if I took veo she could wait wait wait wait what about whatever I can turn into gasps you could turn into gasps turn I could take veo up veo could hook shot when we get up there or feather falls down to somewhere since I'm thinking like yet someone safe elevator would probably pick you one or two floors below where Oscar is but that still skips okay so now the question is what do we think is the bigger risk if we go straight for Oscar which sounds like we could take the elevator up and go for Oscar and skip Emma but Oscar could still call them for gamma and the undead and then we get a whole mess yeah yeah it's fine though because once we kill him and take the staff of Cour than how many undead were there there was a lot there were Sebastian probably saw at least a dozen ghouls hmm and then two more of those larger undead constructs that Oscar you are in has the building mm-hmm I still think I should slide a card under the door the gas thing is it not the party or is it just you I just it's a scroll it's not I can't make all of us gasp okay but I think even if you were gasps and then we again got you teleport us above Oscar and then we like write up the show and then we just mean even past it like up as far as me feather falled and like paratroop silently and and then just land and go you know I'm thinking what can we get or we could potentially just he not know we're there we just in you know and then I can fly if something happens and I can we we have literally never succeeded in surprising our enemy I do we're actually dude we have our insight we know where the people are it's got a work that's like someone saying like you know my dice never roll crits like they just do we're due for a correct dice we're due yeah the old dice games that we used to play yeah with the card of illusions I still use them all just throw the whole deck so you have all conceptualized several different places yeah which one are you going to go with so card under door bursting through the other one take them by surprise cuz gamma was on the bottom floor right she's currently on the bottom floor she might be making her way back up I mean I call dibs we all called there do you okay so vote what's better taking out the infiltrate first yes yeah I think so I think so too if we can be not huge about it yeah I feel like the head of the snake but guys I'm with you all the way whatever you want to do let's burst through those doors first do not pursue that me well Gowell go sneaky create a diversion divergent only when they discover us cuz until they know we're here we have the element of surprise as soon as they discover us we'll start throwing and that's why so slide the card under the first door commotions gonna start in there but they will think that that door is where the thing came from whatever it is that I pull out of this deck and we'll be on the I would say wait till we're in because then you can throw it at the door and it'll be like why isn't that thing at the door and we could use it to like walk past them because then we're already inside instead of at the doors well so if there's doors here and here we slide under this door they all go what's this and then we go yeah I like that yeah yeah but I was thinking wait until we go in because I just if they're just standing far away and they're just looking at the doors they're gonna see us coming they're already gonna notice though if we walk through some doors yeah that's true I think the card is a distraction to draw their attention to a wave on the door yeah I like the door that's why I like the shaft I have my votes for shaft but the shaft is just like you were with us I'm with you but still my votes for sham follow follow your plan now I like the distraction but I think even if there's a distraction on the other door if we open that door they're gonna see us unless there's something blocking our way to like sneak in but I mean if we're gonna go in we're gonna go in and we won't take these guys out we don't want to have them where they're like we don't wanna have them where they're all over the place and then one of them can get away we want to draw them together and then take them out so the the deck of illusion maybe we burst through the same door we throw the card under the door draw everybody towards that we'll just do a Pluto I'm going straight in why don't you just Huck the goo at her you still have some of that goo from them here just Huck the goo adder that'll probably do it and that's all been used to consume stem Oh no but I have a few tricks that can work really well with a group of enemies that are gathered around an illusion you know what I also have to i've fog cloud so if we want to create some confusion i can also do that as well too in order to like have a sneak in so there's gather them to the door I can fog cloud it where they can't see and we can sneak so then there's just this illusory monster in this fog cloud throw that throw that fire elemental walk in the fire elemental door we throw it at the door so they go what's the because I like to think of something that might convey that it's the mage tower up to no good rather than some outside intruders I want to try to guys whatever we do deck of illusions or anything I couldn't do the guise of its the mage tower going crazy because of I was saving that for later but it might be better you're right where their guard is down right now because if we do anything they're gonna be like what's up do you go to free illusion yeah I also have minor illusion could we create something with mire illusion without using the deck where it's not as a recap create a creature okay we create object object Oh or sound I guess I could create sound with your the illusion will make its own sound okay but we can also add more sound can add more sound okay so let's create a huge disruption disruption yeah but draws them all in yeah and then I do want me to fog cloud and then we fireball them okay do we have you know you're a fireball do you on a scroll oh no your ring Oh as far as Sebastian knows he still has it okay wink what do you think Pluto I mean make it a Bursar's aren't we always land on our feet yeah what's the worst that can happen we don't get is kind of to make not a 300-foot sound are you guys just like a 100-foot southland are you guys ready to kill some mages are you killing me just oh yeah I guess okay Oscar I'm dead yeah yes I am thank you for making that moment to truly epic now yep I do my job right we're gonna kill some mages I'm ready okay so tell me what you're going to you so we're gonna go in well we're gonna we're gonna go up to one of the doors okay we're gonna slide a card underneath it okay hope that hope that it creates a distraction okay that draws them closer to the illusion it's worse we have minor illusion and we can have a randomized deck of cards here on my computer what would you like to do it now are we are we doing it should the others get ready by the other door to go through you you - yeah and I slide the card under and you run over to the door I'm gonna listen at the door that we're gonna walk through the door same like me and you ready so you guys are at like the was it fire and the next to it down the hall was air or earth air fire earth which one do you guys want to go through um well we put the illusion on one and then the furthest one that we can get to probably earth from you're scouting was one of the doors do they lead up that's concealed by make maybe another bookcase is it we reveal right into the opening or is there kind of like little hallways anything that we could put ourselves between something that puts ourselves between the line site of where gemma might have been was there a door that looked like it was better suited to hot concealer entrance into the room if someone is up on one of the walkways Limoges there they will have clear sight to all the doors fair this might not work you guys ready like I said we need to fog cloud uh what's a pork chops just say pork chops and I'll fall Club don't we [ __ ] let our entrance anyway should I finish I just followed by us it seems we can't see the fog club yeah we need to be able to see that's why I was figuring if we put it somewhere else it's still [ __ ] we want to get the drop on them I really want so I'm thinking go up from above that's one above but again if we go up we're going up to Oscar yeah messes stuff up captain go right for the tickets go for the knees no the throat I keep missing that worried that we got piled up on yeah I'm worried about that too we gotta find him anyways that's why that's why fun yeah he's nasty get him good get him dirty I just say I felt like it skipped a lot of the it's like it's like it's like getting the cheat codes for the major okay you guys got to make a decision yeah we guys do it let's just do the distraction let's do this under the door yeah we know it's gonna hang hopefully things are gonna happen that's all we know is gonna happen Sebastian which door are you gonna put it under I go to the fire elemental door okay you're under fire yeah you draw a card from the deck I draw a card from the deck and we're gonna go in the other door drying your card you got the eight of clubs which conjures an orc so I pull the card out do I look you guys and I'm like oh yeah yeah guys we got this I'm gonna try to be quiet do we have to fight the orc oh okay good that's a good question though that's a good magic question good I'm glad we don't so what we're gonna do cuz I've drawn a dragon I know I won't yell ignatius until we're fighting something yeah yeah thank you thank you good I really want to yell it just so you guys don't yell it just so a medium it just a whisper run this okay so work out here's in the room from from the card and you can hear on the other side as the orc appears this low growl from the undead creatures and you hear gammas voice raspily cry out how did you get in here you all looks like you've got fresh meat get him yes they're all gonna gang up on Newark what did it give I I like do a sneaky run like tiptoe okay I do a tiptoe run back over to my friends all righty and then we open the door we wait it doesn't sound like there's like this horde of undead you hear footsteps padding towards it and the sound of a hungry cry as the ghouls leap towards the orc we got a hurry because you're okay you crash through the door roll for an issue do we get surprised let's find out 20600 that you could - no I can Sebastian I'm gonna have you make a deception check with advantage beautiful use those days from earlier today oh you baby they do owe me deception with advantage Oh buddy my dice tonight are haunting you that's the second three one you've rolled two threes and two ones I got a 12 on my deception you just don't like you let's gets fine it's pretty good for we here old yeah after a really high deception alrighty Sebastian what did you get furnished it 1414 beyo 26 okay Bluto 1919 okay you got a 14 you said yeah okay okay so I will get okay uh [Music] you can hear the rustling of miniatures being hundreds of undead as they be brought from Monte's hands to the to the table [Music] Oh what's what are you [Music] it looks like one all those things look awful what's he doing over there yeah surprised how he's looking right at us [Music] I need this three-dimensional okay so thank you three dimensions as you crash open the doors you see the group of ghouls leaping off of the bookshelves and bounding towards the orc as they do so you can see one of these massive hulking undead creatures that Oscar yarn has built with a patchwork of machinery tanks and flesh standing underneath the archway of the doorway and another up on the bridge with gamma gamma is there at the top of the bridge pointing down towards the illusion of the orc but as the other door bounds open she quickly snaps her gaze over the ghouls and the constructs are surprised but gamma is not yeah my goddess first to act is veil okay so all of everybody but gamma yeah we get head guy okay you know what I'm going for Jemma I'm gonna miss me in her lock eyes I'm like shoot oh god I am going to this Zephyr strike and aim it at gamma for I'm gonna take three three shots on my first go okay with my longbow great you fire the shots towards her 19 is a 19 as the shots ring towards her she casts shield on and deflects the first shots alright a lot huh 17 it shoes magical energy have the shield is still holding and blocks it I aim at the guy beside her than for me okay so Oh 19 that is a hit nice gather all my days okay 31 damaged beside dam okay the shot crashes through one of the hoses on the attaching this tank on its back to its face and the spray of necrotic fluids fly everywhere that's and it's heavily damaged anything else veo these ladders on the side near us do they go all the way up or there is a criss crossing network of ladders that connect up the bookshelves you could absolutely climb the bookshelves go for it use my feline agility to get to the bookshelves okay which we're over here yeah and then up how many feet would you say that is I want to get behind the tape at the table I'm like Roach down yes okay that's where I'm at sounds good we got a murder Gemma can you give me up there [Music] it is gammas turn however and she sorry no sorry anything going on you know I'm very I'm trying to think it's not happening don't worry don't worry you got this you got this okay gamma looks looks down at the two of you and looks over at veil and kind of surveys the situation between herself and she is going to point over at veil and cast light they oh no no so she she moves over towards you on the bridge so she comes forward and she says you're not gonna get that close that quickly and necrotic energy washes out from her fingers towards you veil and you need to make a constitution saving throw five five that is a failure I'm afraid you're gonna take 8 d8 in the product in Oh No so that's gonna be no actually oh there we go it's gonna be 30 points of necrotic damage as she reaches out towards you and this necrotic power grant like these tendrils of Puppets reach out towards you and you feel like life energy being pulled out of your body I feel aged are you still as hungry as you were in your youth yes if you're hungry some things never change Oh God okay okay how how high up is the first cross 30 feet out can I run and can i - up it can you - up the because you said it's like a crisscross of like ladders and snow yeah no because you don't have a climb speed you it cost you twice as much movement to go up them so if I - could I make it up well you're about ten feet away from the nearest one so if you - you would need you would need to clear 80 feet of movement to get up could I jump the start of it that doesn't give you any additional speed though that still limits you to the maximum speed although if you bounded and jumped and left up oh you want to go off flick to the table or something off at a on the diagonal to save okay sure if you give me an athletics check you bound off the table to climb up to spare yourself the first little bit of the climb 20:23 okay you run up a table and bound up and you make it 15 feet up so I'm gonna say that you if you'd now - and spend the rest of turn you're able to climb all the way up and get rate right to them I'm doing it and then I got an action surge and then I'm just gonna Ignatius yours and then just start wailing loud and now in you're up against gamma okay high gamma and um I'm gonna age Slayer I miss it's epic but I missed okay well I get a one alright that is an epicness but so I lose my footing on the first one I swing and like as I'm coming up I trip on like the last bit and it like lands right beside her but then I swing and I get a big old like 26 - hit 26 that is does she accept my 26 cannot shield that one ignatius crashes down on this poor little gnome 11 regular damage 10 fire damage oh and I want her to make a no just she's gonna take it and then gonna stand right beside her okay looks good to me well next are the ghouls who are summarized are surprised and do not get to act so Sebastian it's over to you alright so they both went up I'm going to hold out my mother's ring mm-hm and it starts glowing with energy as a little bead shoots out of it and lands in the middle of all these ghouls I'll have to make dexterity saving throws yes I are BA one succeeds but that's it do you need dice only two more the blossoming flame crashes into the ghouls and and as though as the flames reach out you can see that for a brief moment the bookshelves flicker and this barrier forms across the shelves that's so small that's so smart but they did that I'm gonna use one sorcery point to re-roll how many can i reroll up to my crown here because a lot of fire greedy greedy slightly better all right counting dice mental math the ultimate 31 damaged incinerated once even the one that's saved the one that saves survives and the the one reading table is also completely destroyed didn't have the same failsafe still there it's the illusion still there no the illusion is fried the illusionary orc screams no I just been born yeah and then I run and I dive behind the rubble here cool and the constructs are surprised as well so they do not get to act this round so you go back to the top with veil I'm gonna shoot at the construct behind Pluto and this time I'm gonna use my hand crossbow nope big old nope wincing in pain is the necrotic energy still Raxus through our body why did you pull out your crossbow the the first shot goes completely why but the second shot lands and Oh sneak attack sneak attack all right take your dice very nice 25 25 BAM okay and then my bonus action I'm gonna use crossbow expert so that third shot oh sorry no I don't get that let me release hold on nope nope nope that's do one move eh oh shoot and wine you know the blight the blade it's fine looking good and then I duck duck down behind the table okay hi Kevin Oh Gemma sees pollute Oh rate up behind her and she is gonna try to cast misty step excuse you I think it goes off allow you to yeah no no it's all unless it says like counter spell counter spells like it interrupts but I swing I get to swing my sword after yeah i teleport as long as you tell them you do use your reaction no she you can do it because can I swing at her yeah you get the swing at her and she's like verbally or like as she's trying to cast a spell you guys a concentration no okay I get a 20 no wait yeah 21 to hit that does hit damage for 13 regular damage and for fire damage okay she is very bloodied and extremely wounded she laughter and she pops over on the other side of the construct and then casts told the dead on Vale no I make a wisdom saving throw they are no oh you have advantage on wisdom saving throws - because of your heroes feast yeah good thing cuz 19 that is a saving throw you do not have to D twelve necrotic gamma grits her teeth and then she runs down the bridge 30 feet 25 feet get back here oh excuse you cool pollute oh you are up I'm gonna try to am I am I within 30 Sebastian No okay I'm gonna this this constructs looking pretty hurt right it is extremely damaged few shots have really wounded it it doesn't 18 hit it does so I taking ignatius down on it for 16 regular damage and seven fire damage you cleave it in Twain and it crashes off the bridge and lands crashing through the bookshelves sending books flying everywhere and then just there's this loud meaty thwack as it goes got support of it everywhere I'm going to yuck swing ignatius down it with the same stroke and stab it into the ground and then reach on my back and just hook my javelin right at Gemma nice I'm going for it yeah out of here 22 to hit that is a hit you can't lock that with shield oh pardon sorry 19 to hit she can block that oh wait no it's what did I say 22 21 20 because it's not the +2 so it's 20 okay then she cannot say yes yeah so is it 11 plus 9 so 22 hit hey I record going in get her and I'm gonna do I'm gonna do it I'm gonna cast the thing the the lightning okay javelin so she's gonna take she fails the saving throw miserably 16 lightning damage and for an 11 regular damage so you throw you you cleave down the creature drop ignatius in the end of the bridge and throw the javelin at her and she reaches her hand up to block it with a shield and the javelin goes rape it took like shatters the shield the arcane energy breaks and it goes right between her hands and the javelin hits her in the throat and then all the electrical energy over the throat horse of her body and she spasms and falls forward onto the javelin which which then it's very gory and as she's spreading her blood I look I turn just to Sebastian with a big smile on my face and I'm like I did it I got her in the throat it was so cool your head like oh man those mean and I'm really proud of myself in this moment he was a serial like from way below you hear like a table and I'm like cool I'm just really proud of myself right now okay the last ghoul runs as quickly as it can towards Sebastian but I think that's this entire turn because it needs to - to get to you seeing it was denied its meal it goes to him Sebastian but it cannot attack and it is Sebastian's turn Crowley flies into the ghouls face and I'm just going to fire bolt it with super advantage okay but that's negated because he's up the up to you and you've disadvantaged fine [Laughter] well no super advantage just right yes vice is that like how many natural ones have we had I've I've rolled four natural ones tonight jill has rolled two - yeah my dates just keep on giving it was leaving it all for Oscar yeah we're do that the ones out now against the ghouls so that I'm that's what that's my turn okay the contract runs up to Sebastian's big meaty fists you're fine though Sebastian getting a twenty five to hit oh no for 18 points of legend a damage yep as it rushes up to you and the ghouls just like right beside you and you step backwards and it just comes around and punches you in the chest I'm winded I'm wearing good you go to the top of the round with Vale I come over the table to the edge and I take my three shots at the big guy sniper position 17 that is a hit and he is based yeah yeah yeah I'll come to 23 do shoot that one first shot mm 13 that is a hit [Laughter] someone clip that someone clip that sounded also a hit Donnie dance so it is heavily damaged it is leaking fluids as the hoses and pipes and tanks on its body are broken in parts of its limbs are damaged and shot as you fire down upon it from above but it still continues forward relentlessly damn Bluto we now go to gamma who is very dead and Pluto I calmly pick up Ignatius I whisper I'm sorry I let me down I saw you put you down on the ground for a moment just know that it's just because you I can't throw you and I calmly walk off let me down again I calmly walk off the edge of the build and I and I just I calmly like just time the the arc of my fall so I'm gonna land right on the construct I'm just gonna drive my blade make an athletics check right you come just like I just take the one step I get at 26 okay you are still going to take five points of bludgeoning damage and soul and prone at the after your first attack worth it the look cool factors just too high right now 25 to hit that is a hit for 17 regular damage and 7 fire damage you leap down spring ignatius across the constructs back ripping open its spine and you and dry land it like in a crumble on the table and then I stand up and and then I'm gonna swing at I get a 2 at 18 dead also a hit for eleven regular damage and a prior damage and you cut the ghoul down as well and there's like pieces of table like stuck in my armor that I'm slowly just kind of pulling out like I stand up like bruised all over and I'm like I I'm pretty sure I had that covered thank you yeah I was just kind of cleaning up and that was so cool you just you just jumped on and I hold in my hand and my spear returns to me my javelin ice and it comes back could you look any crueler right now super cool right now and I just I just put on my hand as I'm looking at you and it just returns to me and then I attach it to my back all of a sudden I see a little hard ice I'll always be there for you as happening I'm like sliding down the ladder and like gulping down like a greater healing potion be like so that was fun and that is where we'll take a break oh and we are back we have finished our short rest and we are ready to

have slain oscar urines apprentice gemma who has survived through all from episode 2 yeah really makes it really makes you think and now gurgling dead with the javelin lightning in her throat at the top of the bridge here the halls the howling wind of the halls above and the crackling energy of the breach in the tower resounds overhead as the flocks of wayward books fly and flitter through the air all through the library seems like the books might be some of the books that were knocked out during the fight picked themselves up and then some of them like one just floats back into place another sprouts some legs and climbs back onto its place in the Shelf and as you begin to pick some things up the scorch marks from the earlier fireball one of those brooms comes from upstairs and again sweeping away go by mystery years oh my god all right eyeing it lightly talking me it should have brought me food on on Gama's person you do find more Scrolls three potions of greater healing oh I just I pick one off of her body and drink it that's 20 yeah I needed that I put one back in my bag because I already drank one of my mom's I'm gonna put one moon too she also in a head the hand and the head and the rod of the librarian I pull the head out anything significant he's very dead emaciated even with a stern looking face of what you can discern of the face it there are there's not much left of him at all but the hand I lost and then I pull the hand out the hand she's got both the hands which she's bound she bound them together because there were six rings so one hand with five rings and one hand with a single ring on it as well I pop those in my bag keep the head then - no no but it's there a pair the hands are apparent it's a bear the head is the or if we need them to get into another person there's so many times that we've needed a helping hand but it's never really helped us get ahead yeah there's also the rod there is also the you the rod that she took from the librarian as I pull the rod out it is it resonates with magic and it is covered in strange runes of of an alien language and looking looking at over there is is a strange kind of magical power here contained within it feels like the magic energy is almost like a conduit to in the in the same way that you would use a wand or a staff to be the conduit from your power for your own arcane power this rod is like that but the conduit the the polarity of the arcane energy is reversed as if it is meant to pull the arcane energy in to the person wielding it and not out I slip it into my pocket I'm gonna see how that goes pocket is that a rod in your pocket yes thanks thanks I don't think we have ten minutes right now but I could read the writing on this rod if I had time to cast a ritual but I think we should probably keep going yeah then we can get it afterwards it might have something to do with that doorway you saw way way up yeah in my well but we want to try to get the drop on Oscar yeah we can get it a literal drop didn't Jemma have anything else on her like in terms of rings or like she was not wearing any rings she also does have on her person several three syringes of aqua expert oh and a potion of aqua delirium as well I take all of those okay so you're those for us yeah she had like a bandolier of these vials around her and so that's that's everything that she was carrying how many awkward delirium just one one and sorry aqua exper go cool oh yeah beyond that the bag that she was carrying had several other there were several other tomes and books inside it of various arcane nature several of them are spell books containing spells of the necromancy school and others of the conjuration school just looking out like just at a quick glance its start you can't tell what spells they are aside from the school and other other spells related to the crafting and binding of magic items and elementals I uh I'm gonna actually pop those books into my bag as well okay they were up to something with the heads and the and the hands and the sewing like I think that he's trying to rebuild the majors yeah and trying to have them run the show I don't know how effective it would be but if he's got the staff of power or at least them the Archmage staff that could be scary even if you can have to it and has like undead mages running around the hallways that's not good no which is exactly why we're gonna kill him so yeah yeah how do you want to go about this you're the stealth captain so above him it's open correct yeah so I'm thinking if if we can you said you have a gaseous form yeah you can creep up all right she's got she's formerly you go up yeah I can I can fly I would I know so all I know all I have is this scroll but what I know from being magic is guys you can study the scroll and understand what the for what what it will do the the potion will transform you or a willing creature that you touch as well as everything that's wearing and carrying into a misty cloud so it lasts for one hour as long as you concentrate on it and you gain a flying speed of 10 feet you've resistance to non magical damage and advantage on strength dexterity and Constitution saving throws you can pass through small holes narrow openings and even mere cracks will you treat liquids as if they're solid surfaces you can't fall and you remain hovering in the air well in the form of a misty cloud you can't talk or manipulate objects and any objects you're wearing or holding can't be dropped or otherwise interacted with you can't tag or cast spells ok ok so I can do that and I can get into the room with him yeah you can and again because it is roll you can use the spell on yourself or someone else so what I'm thinking is Pluto if you can dimension Doris it's far well you know as far as you can but I've even say a hundred feet above right and we feather fall you essentially can drop right in and there's debris above correct there there is debris and floating chunks of rock okay from where we are can I like look up and be like Oscars just like over there like way up yes he is straight up on the other side of the tower so like we could dimension door and be like dimension door above that area and drop it you can certainly try okay so what I'm thinking is if we can feather fall if you want to try to get down to the room where Oscar is I can almost stay up in the debris I can take get further down but take a potion of flying and stay up in the debris and take shots and tie between stuff it's pretty magic up there so don't go into like the debris too far like where the break in the wall is yes there's like magic shooting all around that it's like yeah you might get messed up but I like where you're going with that I'm just giving you the cautious yeah it's pretty magical up there okay not too far so how far would you say up would be that section well see where the electricity is like going down between all the rocks yeah what have you under that okay from from what you recall so the the entire field in the midst is filled with bits of the tower mm-hmm chunks of the meteor and pieces of delirium hmm and the whole thing has resulted in a crackling Corona of arcane energy that the area along the base of the TAT along the tops of the towers are sensibly safe enough for Oscar yarn up there but like there's raw delirium up there and the haze and mist as well as the crackling energy hmm there was a enough room for the ladder to go up and but when Kelly was floating around as the arcane I he didn't go into that space he used the sate he you latter so what could happen if you go in there could be dangerous in addition there is all of the the influence of the delirium and the haze because it is outside turn as well now so that that should be something that is in your mind where's the ladder the ladder is near Oscar where Oscar you are in Santa's workshop and it just goes up from him yeah right I'm also a little concerned if I can defer to my magic people what's gonna happen if we dimension door up there and there's like chaos energy what if it like screws up or dimension door yeah or what if it like throws us outside of the tower yeah true yeah I didn't think it shuts it down like maybe maybe finding a way that's a party maybe then we just get up to this level and sneak across as much as we can maybe you have we moved closer I also have a scroll of invisibility greater invisibility that would be great for the day oh yeah what are you gonna do clunk clunk I might do what I do I'm gonna do what I do best and that's kill mages and I want him to look into my eyes as I murder him but I want him to look into my eyes while I murdered her well let's make him let's make his eyes face two different ways then while we do it yeah okay so as I said before it's a couple hundred feet to climb up not impossible but certainly a difficult climb up the bookshelves there is a spiral staircase that connects to the the room as well that you could take up all and there's all the bridges and everything that go along through floating books wise when does that start they're just flitting around just being flying books and can I can I fly like I try to flutter with them like is the is looking gravity your arms and guy to fly but you don't know I'm still treating potion for that I'm still too heavy grab a book will it fly I grab books I grab the biggest book I can when you touch the book it just gently rests in your hands and let you read it I can't read okay as you throw it it just writes itself in flutters off or is that too dangerous I think it's too dangerous so we have to grab it there so we have to go up from here do we still want I can make somebody invisible yeah I can make somebody gasp yeah I think you should throw the more cards does that work you have anything like silence or something I have pass without trace which word that gives us extra tend to moving but it doesn't make us invisible yes I was gonna say something to stop him from casting spells would be great um I have a few ideas it's called murdering him murder him well if we make our way up the staircase that'll help and then we take the books the bookcases for the rest of the way like we work we go up like 5050 how he's about a hundred feet above us or several about 300 so we can go up like 200 feet on the staircase oh my god they're coming like 20 stories on a bookcase oh no on the Serkis yeah okay that's good it's a Stairmaster are you ready no I'll be fine I don't know you guys I got a good Constitution uh I can fly I can fly I could play and the potion that does that so I'm probably just gonna fly yeah I have it for an hour so okay do it I like that dude am I gonna gas and I'm gonna walk why do you want to stay with Pluto or no door do you wanna make you gaseous and mute invisible hmm this is an invisibility no scroll haven't been a visibility or potion of mobility because remember after you can you scroll you still need a concentrate on it so the the other thing too is that invisibility only lasts for like a minute oh yeah because I think one of us got a potion of invisibility one of us got flying and then you got involvement of invisibility and a scroll of Greater invisibility Oh yep greater would let me pass spells while remaining invisible oh so you could give him the potion of invisibility and you do the scroll on yourself sure yeah and then you could cast also being invisible like that's that he can't see me when I murder him that's only yeah I know or you take the sorry scroll of gaseous form right yeah is that and that concentrates okay that doesn't work it works well if he's gonna be gaseous and then you take a regular potion of invisibility cuz you've a scroll of greater right you can't do two Scrolls yes I am yeah we now have to overthink it hey you know we I think we have a good plan walk up there murder Oscar collect reward I'm just gonna walk with Pluto until we're closing all right I'm gonna fly she can fly I can fly she can fly so veo drinks the potion to fly it begins hovering up the tower will the two of you begin walking up the stairs yes okay the climb all right you begin your way climbing up the stairs as you'd all do that do so I will get you to all roll me a perception check I got a 1911 1124 okay as you are about 200 feet up the stairs about two-thirds of the way up Pluto and Sebastian you spy it there is a ghoul watching over the ledge about a hundred feet away and it sees you and it turns to bolt is it like okay where it is is it away from Oscar's platformer is it like it would be bolting in the direction it so where the where the break is where the library ends and the broken part begins it's looking over the ledge and it sees you and it turns it growls lowly and it it goes to bolt what is it standing on it is standing on the broken edge of the tower would you say it's a little rubble II yeah what do you want to do mold earth to collapse the ground on the ledge so that he falls okay I will do you can do an opposed spell casting ability check against his dicks again and or what's your spell CDC 17 okay are you gonna roll against that and make it Dexter he's gonna make it next area Majorca it's a natural one and he falls so I see him turn and I just go and the granite masonry major and he collapses and as he turns he howls out and cries out my Falls all the way down but a court card throw a card somewhere no she just fell naturally okay hi doc behind is there something to duck behind um you would need to dive off the staircase towards one of the reading the reading nooks I dive into the nearest nook okay make a spell check yep diving they are you gonna do against the wall itself where I'm kind of loading up with are crevices that I can hide against yeah there's some bookshelves that you could hide in a book yeah I'll check you got six 18 19 okay as you dive for cover you see another ghoul look up where the ledge fell down it looks at the ledge looks down at the ghoul and as it looks down at where the the google has fallen all the way down it sees would you get 6 I think 18 19 it sees all 3m here and it's it's just with these the sharp senses of a predator it looks down at the Fallen ghoul and sees veo she dives it in and essentially as it comes up at catches sight of all three of you as you've done all the hiding spots on I and try to crumble it even further you can make it we're gonna roll for initiative to see if you can react that that quickly oh man I got a natural 20 I got a natural one okay so the ghoul sees the three the three of you you turned them oldearth and it turns and it bolts back can I throw a javelin at it that's if you beat its initiative of twenty sorry 22 specifically cuz its deck I got an initiative of I can't uh 21 damn yeah it's got a 22 with a natural 20 stop it so we got a run we have to hurry okay how many feet down over we're still a hundred feet away from roughly where Oscars mm-hmm Pluto just teleport up there huh where we going Disneyland where you're pointing so we're not doing it I just I'm just gonna go for his ledge I don't know man all right ideas it's go time we have to beat the ghoul to surprise Oscar I remember the plan of of the minor illusion where you showed us where everything is and I'm like I am one with you and I grab your temple I grab your temple and I dimension door as close to Oscar urine as I can and I try to make it look magic II but I really don't know what I'm doing just holding your alrighty so what did you guys get four initiatives 21 21 prevail is that the initiative we're using yeah because you guys have decided to go go forward with this onee you got a 20 okay three 300 yeah there it is guys there it is okay so Sebastian's got three so he's going dead last I was not expecting to be grabbed by the temple it threw off my whole game I could have just done this to 21 okay sorry Sebastian it's not hard to beat a three I'm not upset I this is my gift we should someone be at home how many one have enrolled tonight and then Ludo you said you got a tour not 20 okay so let's roll off as Oscar tae-jong 18 yep on the dice okay top of the rat Oh what yeah cuz the ghouls got they're doing great they're doing good okay so and Val you're a hundred feet down I'm still okay so here's where we're at [Music] hi I hope you can get up there quickly where did we teleport to he said right but close as you could get as I I grabbed your temple and I tried to envision everything that you saw and everything you told me and I tried to go right beside where Oscar urine was sewing things holding up a staff I don't know if you want to just hold off on me right now cuz I'm still looking book and I embraced you with your mother's cloak so it really felt at home oh when I did it this is a good idea this is warm this is a great idea so you have a tell that you have attempted to teleport to a space that you cannot see well in the environments of the amethyst Academy oh my you can intelligent both of you can make an intelligent saving throw oh that's not a good one 11 11 16 okay Sebastian you succeed occlude oh I need you to roll me 80% happens oh I have a feeling I shouldn't if I'm gonna end up you're gonna tell for me into his room 33 33 okay dirty three I'm not I'm home man oh no everything's fine no it's great it's all gonna work everything okay so you got a 33 correct yep okay you have suffered a teleportation this happen okay the way you said that makes it sound really okay well it might not be I need you to roll me a d8 followed by 2d sixes I got a 4 ok a 4 and a 4 okay so first of all you land so you know where do you think Oscar yarn is now what you know will land and sorry roll one more d6 as well please so form the eight four and the four four and four of all fours so you land in the air 30 feet in the air 40 feet over hey that asks me the flight stamping that that way and immediately fall 30 feet down taking ten points a bludgeoning damage and landing prone now and your brain is scrambled and you are stumped oh and I appear in the room and Sebastian you you do you appear i an't are completely on target in the room so work like it's all real grabs me and it's just like unlike we got this we got this and then I just appear by myself and you hear a loud thud in the other room and I mustered yeah and in this moment I muster all of the confidence that I could possibly have and I just try to stare at Oscar yarn as I pop into existence there and I hold out my wand and I go Oscar yarn my name's Sebastian Crowe and I'm going to kill you fantastic nice okay so the the ghouls are the first to act sorry actually oh yeah the ghouls are the first act responding to the crash in the scene several of the ghouls rush forward hello ghouls and the two in the room leap across the table to assault you Sebastian they leap across to attack immediately and they both attack with their claws oh you had teleporting when you can't see I remember now okay ever so you see before you I remember now the firt here's what you see as the ghouls leap before you you can see Oscar urine but he has become a before he was a mockery but now he is something completely different Oscar urine scene clearly and this up close now you can see that he is still the obese large man that you remember with his kind of like 5 o'clock shadow scraggly pockmarked face but there are strips of his flesh that are peeling off and as he raises his hand up you can see that he has cut off his own arms and replaced them with the two desiccated hands of the other mages of the amethyst academy so you can see that one of his hands has someone else's arm like one of his arms had someone else's arm on it with the five rings on one side and the other hasn't four rings on on the other and you recall now that the Archmage did not have either of her hands so he so and they they look like they actually look like women's hands that he has put on to him and one of them grips the staff of power he has embedded shards of delirium into his chest and back and they are shutting out of him like Armour and his eyes are just burning with this with these purple fumes as he looks he looks over at you and the ghouls leap across the table to attack I need a hero moment here I need I need dice rolls in my favor the ghouls get a 15 and 13 hit shield you block them with the shield and they're repelled off next up is Vail so I'm a hundred feet down with with my flying can I use my feel an agility um if I run up the wall I don't see why not okay never seen a cheater run I'm a cheater run up the wall yeah and I and I I - is my bonus action using my cunning action okay so if I so you clear a hundred and twenty feet yes pass through theirs and then do you like bounce off and fly into the air yeah the idea is that I push off I fly up and can I see okay making acrobatics check with advantage because as you're pulling yourself forward like if University astronauts on the space station when they're pulling themselves up without any gravity yeah you kind of tap into the fact that there's the gravity's a little weak here as you start pulling yourself up the bookshelf so make an acrobatics check I do have a level of exhaustion okay so does that give me like equal equal out yeah sixteen okay so you can increase your speed by thirty feet oh okay yeah with with the result of your acrobatics check so 120 plus thirty yeah okay so I want to get that far in the air okay so you're 50 feet up yeah from the from the ledge from here you can see Sebastian you can see Oscar urine you can see all of this going down what will you do you notice that there are at least six goals you see pollute Oh stunned in the in the corner over there yeah two more of Oscar urines constructs and Oscar enriching himself in a workshop where he has been carving up all the corpses of members of the amethyst Academy and I see this giant thing of delirium in the room correct you see shards of jaiku it get much like the river below there are shards of the meteor and pieces of delirium just as large in this area I take a magic arrow let me take my first shot and I shoot the Delirium Oh piece of delirium a big one right oh yeah yes yes BAE oh oh okay see unfortunately the shot goes wide and does not strike the Delirium sharks it's a natural one yep i'ma try again another magic arrow with another magic here we finally got him off my list okay oh my god probably gonna be okay roll your damage against the Delirium crystal I see this happening and I'm gonna shield my eyes for whatever you shield up keep your sure that okay I got a shield and I go I see you're shooting [Music] 26 damaged okay The Shard bursts in eighth Corona of shrapnel in a brilliant corona of shrapnel arcane energy and pieces of delirium which fly about the entire room rays of prismatic energy burst forth from the exploded crystal out to a range of within everything within 30 feet of where the crystal was [Music] that looks like pretty good measuring to me okay the desk the desk in front of me gets happy effect of this is like a prismatic spray this is amazing yeah it's it ring and it rings out across the entire room I need so veil you are going to roll a d8 for each subject that has been hit let's go let's start small and work our way up to Oscar the ghoul to you author ghoul 8/8 big guy come back to that one eight eight five five okay Steve a little thing beside Oh is there a little creature next room it's a hangout there there is a little creature next to him yeah that little guy one one okay two eight eight five and one I think one of the cool one of those are ones besides Sebastian that's probably get hit by it yeah seven seven okay so here's what happens Oscar the first rule takes oh and the other construct is actually out there as well yep three three okay now the whole area is now going to be covered in haze for the great the throw the duration now and as the arrow resounds out the crackling light I'm going to have you I mean if you and Sebastian both make [Music] dexterity saving throws you really like rolling 27:27 for okay Sebastian you are blinded until you succeed a constitution saving throw at the end of your turn oh do you need to see things to cast I know the approximate area yeah I just carried on the firewall yeah and Austrian makes well he's caught in the area so he suffers whatever happens to him so I'm not gonna make saving throat so Oscar urine is gonna take 10 d6 cold damage which he does make his saving throw but he still takes half the cold damage 10 d6 yes ayo is the greatest gross okay [Music] it's still awesome that's amazing no it's like I can already see like three sixes in 39 okay so okay he cries out the large construct it suffers special it's struck by two rings rolled the eight two more times a da two more times yeah - so and one it takes ten d6 fire and ten d6 acid and the ghouls the the two ghouls nearby are utterly annihilated mm what do they think what did they get hit by two and the one got hit by 10 d6 acid as well yeah the other got hit by two rays as well so we'll figure out exactly what happened him but they're gonna be annihilated oh it's okay that had a lot of ones it's a beautiful me half of the damage but it will be done 20 d6 it's like a 38 38 yeah hey and then 10 more d6 that's amazing that's so much damage Irish Ritalin now on rolling 10 dice at a time we're here with Jill and she rolls 10 dice at a time to determine how much we kill everything in this room I'll take being blinded I'm glad I didn't get hit by you don't want to see what's gonna happen ya know my eyes go blank and I just hear like 41 so 4079 damage was it 79 damage totally it was 41 and what was the other one 38 38 so yeah so 78 damage it is perfectly damaged but still stand oh yeah he's another one had to and just rolled the DA it's to see what happened to the one that got hit twice by to raise seven okay that's interesting and seven Oh so ignore the duplicate result reroll it - yeah it's annihilated by acid damage but it also technically would have turned to stone and the last construct it takes I'm just gonna have it take another 39 of the damage so just because I don't want to have your roll that many dice again so much man so it takes the light now but one little bronze one was very nicely done well done the potato that you'd like to hold there I did all my movement so okay yes I will stay there run as fast as we teleport Pluto you are stunned but the stun is over now okay yeah I stand up yeah Oscar urine clutches his side as the frostbite grips through his body and he looks at that and he yells back do you have any idea how valuable that was my work I'll kill you die he said that before any cast finger of death at you they did I make the Constitution say 400 make the Constitution saving for oh you can do it 1818 that is a successful they'll pick half damage oh gosh I did a lot of damage them it makes sense that they would do a lot of damage to me yeah if you die from that what happens I don't know I'm nervous I'm really nervous no the full damage of it would have been 75 damage yeah I would so that's half which is 33 necrotic damage handled couldn't have handled what was gonna happen yeah fires it yeah he's got to move closer to get you in range so he waddles across the room storming forward like he's gesturing at his ruin'd workshop and carrying the staff in his hand and he just points it because this black and green beam comes straight from his finger it strikes you in the heart and you just feel like okay and he's walking through the haze in the smoke and he just breathes in the air of the crystals as if he's completely unperturbed by the the radiant energy coming off of it and anything else from Oscar urine I don't think so that's all from him this turn we go now to Oscars constructs the first of Oscars constructs it picks up a boulder and it throws it at you they oh dear but it goes completely wide and the other rushes towards Sebastian and gets a Sebastian you're blinded so we've got advantage doesn't help him he only gets a 13-2 hit and I still have my shield oh yes yes oh yeah I'm unlucky I'm I can't see but he punch it's my shield cool Sebastian is your turn knowing that there's all this commotion happening around me I am going to oh no I can't Thunder step if I can't see ya you're blinded okay that sucks I'm going to okay so when you see through anything that you have like familiar oh my god can I see through you need to spend an action to see through your phenomenal things then I'm going to in my blind confusion I'm like oh Reaper get'em and I pull Reaper who jumps out of this like fiery pets yeah at I think technically you need to see this see it to stop to summon it but I might allow this yeah you have to see the creature within 120 feet yeah yeah so it doesn't work yeah it doesn't work because you have to you have to SiC him on a creature you can see with 120 feet of I gotta use these goggles at one time yeah okay that's why you just you're always blind man okay you've really you've really stumped him that's great you got something keep looking keep digging okay I'm going to I'm just going to like so okay so I step back and I pull my wand out and just blindly I'm like all right Pluto I don't know where you are it's gonna get weird and I point and I'm just gonna shoot a hypnotic pattern I was frog okay so the construct and Oscar urine are in the in the area incidentally the contract is not immune to the term and it promptly fails it's in trouble Oscar though he gets a 22 on his wisdom saving throw that'll do it so the contract is incapacitated anything else Sebastian you know now with the construct incapacitated I'm gonna take the opportunity attack from the ghoul it gets a natural one and just stomach light I run and I probably smashing it's like stumble and like try to find my way to where I heard what you want to drop Rome not really okay okay sounds good I just imagine me smashing smashing over and stumbling like holding the bookcase falling oh my god and can I roll to try to unblind myself yep make a Constitution saving throw 20 your vision returns to you oh thank god alright gods we go to the top of the round I only think I have one ghoul left and it runs to pursue you Sebastian's getting a 16-2 hit oh there's one over there too Oh way over here way over here okay yep two of them oh yeah I forgot about them before so they're gonna climb up and they're gonna they're just gonna climb up and they're gonna get where great where you put them there gluto is there another one um and I'm gonna cast shield again to block the ghoul okay you do so yeah that will climb right up okay so you blocked the attack from the from the ghoul yeah sounds good to me as my vision comes back I turn around I'm like okay just in time hey oh you're up okay question there's another crystal there sebastian is technically within 30 feet but he's got a big stone thing blocking him will he still have the same effects oh you betcha okay I'm not gonna do that yeah don't don't don't then I aim my crossbow at Oscar urine and I take a couple shots at him okay go for it uh 17 Oscar urine raises a shield of his own battle hmm alright then i Rea my crossbow at this construct okay 22 that is a hit nice the one that's incapacitated yep and extremely wounded fair fair Oh no sneak but you will get everything else 17 damage you're incapacitated there you're able to land a critical a key shot against the its spine and it drops over the table and and destroys what remains of it okay then I get my third and I'm gonna go for the ghoul that's can I see the Google chasing Sebastian yep go on gonna go for that one ten that is miss and then I'm gonna fly down around where the bridge hits and around the corner so that way I am okay out of sight sounds good I don't mind not really out of mind but you know but I'm like around the corner all right Pluto it's your turn I recover from what I can only assume is [Laughter] humiliation like what happened like I woke up and now there's like this pink haze yes and you see so this is like all these lights came flying out of it's like you just fell out of the boat it's like the shots are ringing around the explosions or oh yeah waiting in your ears yeah and I just see like Sebastian like crawling out of them nestle following around this yeah they fly around debris at ghouls chasing after me and I'm like huh I'm gonna just like pick up the pace and run toward an intercept this ghoul that's coming in front of Sebastian okay and I'm a-gonna Ignatius and I get 15 that is a hit for 11 regular and 7 fired and caught the ghoul down the Burning Blade already cauterizing what is left of its undead flesh and then I I just looked just Sebastian for what's going on what happened we're gonna kill Oscar Yard where is he right over there point back into the mess I'm like somewhere in there and that's the end of my movement ok we go over now to Mardin Oscar urine who turns over - he dies behind the wall but there and sees that the two of you approaching and casts cloud kill that's not good and a rolling bank of fog appears over the two of you I'm gonna try to counter spell it you cannot you've already used your action right I did you can get out of this one compared to the last one we were in you know so that's not good right no you can see now you can see your death it's fine everything's fine and magic is hard there you can remove the steps for down to make it yeah flat yep cool okay Walter it does get the ghoul and in the cloud kill good okay and you hear him yell out my minions I hold them down and let them choke on their treachery and he crouches behind the the wall phosphorus constructs are there's still one going and it's gonna run up it's gonna - right out in front of Oscar yarn and Sebastian it is your turn make a constitution saving throw you are in the area of poison oh oh wait is it poison it is poison we're immune to poison because of hero's feast breathe it in and I just like is that the best you got yarn and I am going to just casually walk to the other side like I've passed the ghoul okay and I look Oscar in the eyes and I'm like you're not getting away this time and I go to cast what I think is fireball but what starts to happen is my cape not cape my cloak starts to bellow back behind me and I lift into the air and my eyes turn black and I call forth a synaptic static okay oh wait sorry before this happens as I'm raising into the air the hound jumps and grabs Oscar yeah bonus action okay and then as the Hound jumps and bites at Oscars throat I erupt with like this scream of energy as synaptic static explodes all right here all righty Oscar your and see it sees that and he says your magic is feeble pathetic sorcerer and casts counterspell he's got to try to counter spell it so it's a fifth level spell so I got to be 15 yeah yeah if can I wait until your role to decide if I want to counter spell as counter spell no okay he has to beat 15 yeah I'm gonna try to counter spell as counter spell okay your counter spell is successful because it's matching his level and his counter and his story fail is negated it's worth it it's right synaptic static goes off and they have to make intelligent saving throws him with disadvantage okay he gets a 19 with disadvantage he's so good I was I was hoping for intelligence I know I knew it was written but that's why I threw the advantage and the constructs utterly fails and so does the ghoul okay all right so it snapped ecstatic so it's 86 so he'll still take half damage but he won't have muddled thoughts which was really going to impair him do you need that I got it I'm gonna use one more sorcery point okay get some of those yeah I got a few ones in there this is a cos die so I'm actually gonna re-roll that and go one more yeah I got a 1 out of that okay it's okay nicer the dice are making just work harder in the real 26:26 damage okay that destroys the ghoul yeah yep construct is still going and Oscar urine does have to make a concentration check which she succeeded Sparko not that it matters too much because she's not gonna be - okay great anything else Sebastian uh reaper bites him okay Reaper get him get him boy who's the goodest dog good as dog gets 17:17 that that will hit and he's already used his reaction because of his counter spell seven damage seven damage every little bit everything helps okay and he continues to concentrate on on Coghill however great okay that's it for Sebastian yeah yeah top of the round with the ghouls so I do have two ghouls remaining the ghoul turns around and it tries to grab you Sebastian make us make an acrobatics or athletics check and it the other ghoul also tries to grab you hey I got a ten I get a fourteen you are grabbed where is there should be oh the no yukio the ghoul was killed yeah right I killed okay yeah so like no the one he killed yeah I got really tries to grab Sebastian that's it it still tries to grab me but like its upper half and I just can't pick it it's gone okay though you're up okay so I'm behind the thing yeah and there's no angle that I could see Oscar I know cuz he's right up beside the wall the solid wall there so you would need to either fly much higher than that or much closer than that well cuz I'm on like ground right you're on ground level which is actually 10 feet below so you would need to probably fly up about 50 feet to be able to it's actually even then you have to fly 50 feet up and far further forward to be able to get a shot on it over the wall um so and right now he can't see me no he cannot okay I'm gonna do is I'm going to go through this door okay I'm gonna sneak closer so that way I'm there's a little kind of nook here yeah I want to hide behind the wall and I want to ready my longbow so that way if Oscar comes into play I let go a shot okay and you want to use the cutting action to hide yes okay cool make a stealth check okay you are definitely been a proponent good natural okay 32 alrighty Pluto you are up I see veo getting into position I know you don't cuz you're in the cloud kill oh and I'm sneaky I breathe it in hmm good okay I'm gonna run up the stairs okay leap off the stairs I want to jump the construct okay as you go you're running up the stairs and you leap over out of the cloud kill give me and because you're you can't see the stairs as you run up them give me that athletics check with disadvantage I know I get a 16 okay you are able to run up the stairs but the stairs will cost you twice as much movement I accept okay so you can make it here can i running jump off of it yeah and leap down onto the contract can I get to Oscar I think from where you were you would run it unless you're dashing you're gonna run out of speed I run out of speed so okay I'm gonna just try to get to the construct okay you leap down I'll give you advantage on your tackle against the contract oh is you burst out of this cloud kill again epically 21 to hit 21 to hit that is a hits for 17 regular damage okay and 10 fire damage nice you cleave it in twain and it is destroyed and then oh man [Music] like I can't make it to him I'm just so close it's so far away no range yeah I could I can the Hakka javelin but then I have to drop my sword I'm just gonna hold my shield up and stare at him all righty my hope is just to run up and shove him I was too far okay I'm just gonna stand there and look at him okay Oscar you're in hey husband sees sees the review he takes a step back behind Reaper so loops around does that make him visible to Vale for the time being it will make him visible today oh okay take my shot you're gonna take your shot yep yeah as he steps back and there's nothing because he hears me do I get advantage yeah you have a bandage on the shot [Music] 22 that is a hit let's twist one girl hug you man yeah I just like I've been like pushing him around the whole time you're fine yeah he's 30 damage he turns around and catches a glimpse at you Vance's I thought I'd killed you never mind nine lives still with these three first and he taps the staff of power and casts a cone of cold no I don't I don't have any counter spells slow um shields no hello Reaper no I'm gonna get Reaper Pluto and Sebastian you can owe me I believe that's Constitution saving throws against the cone of cold yep Reaper gets a four okay Reapers dead okay maybe I mean I know we'll see we'll see Sebastian Constitution yep 1919 and Pluto I got an 11 but then I used indomitable and I got a 23 so you both succeed and instead of taking 50 cold damage you both take 25 what about the ghoul the cool the ghoul gets a natural one and is frozen solid yeah yeah I gotta say it's actually it's still it's frozen solid so it's still holding you in its grasp and Reaper is turned into an ice statue and shatters into pieces No summon another one and then Oscar urine is going to step Russia back behind the rocks over there so that he know the the bigger rock yeah yes and he's gonna take cover behind that away from ya evilly yeah so that he's holy behind offer la nothing yeah and then turn it back to what he's so scared yeah he's hiding he's hiding behind the rocky okay with that oscar's constructs are both destroyed and Sebastian it is your turn can I like try to squeeze out of the grip now that he's frozen solid can I like and like Joe say you could use your movement to try to squeeze out with an acrobatics check 19 okay it will cost half your movement but you can squeeze out nice nice I kind of then kite along here to the point where I can see Oscar yarn mm-hm and again I stare them in the eyes and I'm like you're trying to hide you can't hide from us Oscar and I lift my hand up and again out of the pit here Oscar were your nightmares now and it jumps at him so I'm just gonna do a quick attack with with that Reaper who crits Thatta boy so we burn unexpectedly the dog reappears jumps and bites him in the face so [Music] how are we doing Koretz right now we should have discussed it before the session yeah yeah that's good that's good 15 more damage nice that leaves Oscar urine bloodied and then I'm going to throw a web between the rock and the wall okay all over so at the start of his journal he'll have to make a that's dirty sir I don't really need that you've got the idea there's web all of it looks good looks good okay back to the top of the round with veo and I rise so I can see Oscar which is only actually like what 30 feet yep that far and I look at him and I I'm actually I'm gonna take my two longbow shots but I am going to Zephyr strike just like the wind picks up make it more dramatic so I get advantage on my first shot nice not long but um 16 that is a hit [Music] this is okay 33 damage Oh beautiful I take the second shot 22 to hit that is also a hit 23 damage [Laughter] he gasps out as the as the arrows ring into him just for the record though you need to come like 50 percent forward not gotta get make that shot get up like so that she's on the platform okay like I mean you've been up and forward but I don't I don't even have to be on the thing I guess yeah yeah basically she's deaf that's there right on top I'm probably not that vibe yeah okay and I keep chokes for a moment nee grits his teeth is like I'm going to kill that cat and anything else yeah uh with my bonus action actually I'm going to use your bonus actions after strike oh I did yes you're sure no that's it good loot oh you're up I'm gonna I can't get close enough can i if you if you measure me out Sebastian but I think you could - to him okay I'm gonna - right up to him okay hello and uh and then that is my turn he looks at you all he says to hell with you all and he snaps the staff of power in half no triggers a retributive strike all of you can make a dexterity say vitro alright [Music] 28 I have a question 8 does my mage Slayer count for this for advantage 3 ok so the staff of power he has used it twice so it has remaining inside it 10 charges so polluter you take 80 points of force damage else they owe you made your save and your a 30 feet away so you take 20 points of force damage and Sebastian you are 30 feet away so you and you failed your save you had an eight yeah you take 40 points of force damage I'm fine everything's fine I have the pure upped of wound closure it just I just lay there oh yeah you do I'm just laying like 2 percent better he has that thing that like helps him stay alive he has that amulet that he bought we forgot about it you should have taken your potion of didn't bother ability I don't need it I stand beside him and he just breaks it on me it's my turn I think that's where we're going [Laughter] but wait don't we need this to have a power yeah oh you really shouldn't I've got an exit strategy if we need it next week it's my turn next week it's your turn is this like giving the bomb to the Queen did we fail no no me and Bale we're doing so alive as the dust and smoke clears mime see the what the shattered and savaged remains of Oscar urine bits of bone fragments and blood and the shattered pieces of the staff power on the ground before it and I slump over to him and I take the pieces of the staff of power and I grab Pluto in my arms and I look up at Vail are you okay okay and for the record for he did not get teleported to another plane of existence I am so disappointed oh you know you know what's the most upsetting he died thinking he killed all of us I stand up that loser I'm sure we can talk to the demon later and find out what happened we'll just figure out a way to go back in time before this and well just do the old man MC you I am I was so scared when you broke the stuff I'm still scared I couldn't get close to him that's you only had a little bit of help sorry no it's okay oh my god Wow Cristal was really
