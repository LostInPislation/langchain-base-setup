videos to our heroes look out from the high perches of the clock tower of dragon Hein where the after in the aftermath of the Battle of this water and slaughter stone square camping out at the clock tower with some of the survivors of the hooded lanterns including the Lord Commander our heroes have now won a great victory but at great cost together with the hooded lanterns in the silver order and the help of the executioner the Lord of the feast has been slain although what that bodes for the future of slaughter stone square and the enigmatic engine of destruction that is the executioner only time will tell but for now the scourge of the temple ward of dragonhide the lord of the feast is dead and the power of the Noles the what the uniting force behind them has been broken well scattered war bands individuals scavengers and survivors will stalk the streets until every last one of them is slain their ability to represent to unite as a single force is likely broken for the foreseeable future and now the sights of our heroes are set upon the Cathedral of st. petrulio which lies vacant at least of the great threat that is the lord of the feast sounds like we're on the home stretch guys yeah we still though that one Knoll who healed and brought back the chuva I don't think that's gonna be a an easy task well I happen to have a few tricks up my sleeve to deal with that it's me he has me there up his sleeve and I go to like a look of the city and my my hands up your it was it was fireball we don't know was fireball fireball was my trick usual now I keep wanting to do so I guess yeah where we have a final push to make we got to take that Cathedral and reclaim it for the city yes and to find the wheel and the badge mainly for that yeah with the Lord of the feast gone it's gonna give us a huge advantage and if we can cleanse the cathedral and keep all you allowed we can go to raiding this cleansing process hmm does it does it get rid of like all evil beings does it what are you worried about yourself you're evil but no your hound and your horn and darkness darkness is kind of a thing that happens around me and I just hope that I don't get like a clan I don't know I I could picture some weird stuff going on likeness Lee I just want to let you know that it's a risk I'm willing to take well what's the lipstick it happen right yeah if you want to stand in the doorway while we do it and then it's and then kind of tiptoe your way in just to see or stand right on the doorway to see if you get launched out you know I've never really tested the whole like consecrated ground thing we like me having kind of shadowy background I don't know we'll see gluto bring the popcorn yeah I want to see him get launched I'll bring the snacks we're gonna try to just drink some holy water and see what happens as you assemble your equipment get your gear back together and prepare to make out to towards the Cathedral the Lord Commander Elias Drechsel approaches you all and he says I'm gonna round up any of my soldiers who can still stand we've got a lot of wounded we've lost a lot we haven't counted the number of casualties yet I'm getting reports in there's a few people that have been able to make it this far into the city well you're gonna go into the cathedral in one last push one last push strike them while they're weak yeah yeah and distracted strike while the iron is hot yeah back in cast fear we don't have irons we we dry our clothes by the fire oh it's you just you just wear wrinkly clothes in fact in caspia wrinkled clothes are all the rave right now it's called the crinkle cut very well I am going to assemble my men and we are going to patrol the area around the cathedral and make sure that if you get there no other Knolls come anywhere close to support whatever might be remaining there we're gonna start mopping up the streets as best we can and hopefully we can keep the roads clear and safe through the day at least until the silver order and the flame keepers can arrive at the cathedral so you're gonna protect us from the outside make sure that no gnomes come back and if there's not nones normals I'm not here for killing gnomes aha make sure that no nulls come back Freudian slip you want to kill knows and we're gonna be your strike force that goes index into the cathedral clears it out leaving an opening for a philia to get in there and start the ritual to cleanse the place indeed ok are we thinking barging in the front door yeah it's probably the most act I leave it up to you way to decide how you want to get in the cathedral itself has the main entrances around the front I personally don't have a problem if you want to break in through the roof or any of the stained glass windows but that's up to you if you want to take other ways in it would probably be through some of the windows or anything else if you wanted to take a route like that to get in it's really up to you the silver order and a few people might be upset if you do break any of the windows on your process in but we're lucky that most of them are still intact anyways do what you have to do get in that place isn't gonna burn down at the very least speaking of burning things down there's very important documents do you know where in the Cathedral they are like if I walk in and start blasting fire all over the place should I be concerned or are they deeper into the cathedral will I know it when I see it from what I understand the document the documents that we're looking for anything that we what might need would be kept in the undercroft of the cathedral itself I don't know what sort of state that's gonna be in the scriptorium 'he's the storerooms the vaults are all underneath the cathedral along with the other crypts as well okay they should I should be good to set off a few explosions in there clearly had some final NOLs just maintain maintain the structure that holds the ceiling up I'll try it's made of mortared stone the cathedral is a durable building it's no fortress but it almost is but he's Sebastian Crone he's he always tests the structural integrity of everything he enters through fire my own house you know things like flame things not your fault it was a complicated scenario yeah I didn't have my glasses but from what I know from the entrance in the back near the altars is where the stairs down below are so you do have to go into the most holy areas of the Cathedral to get down to the crypts below we can do it yeah this is like easy this is easy mode I mean with the nulls broke and this is gonna be a cakewalk cake cake there's cake afterwards there's cake inside they are you but you only it only unlocks when you kill every last Knoll in there done that's motivating that's motivation if I don't get cake afterwards I'm gonna be very upset I make my way back to the barracks and assemble some of my soldiers he points to a few of the few of the soldiers who can stand around him about half a dozen hooded lanterns are ready to go he says these six are gonna start start scouting the area and pulling away any groups of knowles that might be nearby so that you've got some clarity around around them you but you've got the run of the space do what you need to do that's what we need and he then turns to you and says and hands you a few more canisters that are painted red green and black few extra canisters if you need help I'm gonna shoot someone with one of these it's fun to Battelle you so if you are gonna be moving in to the cathedral fire the green flare if you get there and the situation looks bad and we need to re-evaluate fire the black one and if you think that we can handle it but you need some help fire the red one obviously if you fire it inside the cathedral will it have enough force to break through a window if we fire it out a window you can try all right I always climb up to a window I like Tron or the door fire one green flare that you're going in once you've clear the whole space fire a second one do you think that firing the flares is going to attract more Knowles hopefully they haven't caught on to what they mean yet I think if the end if they do we'll run into our patrols okay let's do it Jack and force force Dragonforce we ain't scared of no Knowles what if like guide your path oh thank you might be with you what's the what's the common child let's say flame guard you flame guard you flame guard you I'm learning them flem guard you get burned look see you later with that you set out I think so yeah there's there's not much we need we have a full rest right I think it's better to leave first thing from no time to waste the Lord of the feast has fallen and we'll probably never see him again I can feel confident saying that by the way remember when we were requested to get his Pelt mm-hmm what are we doing about that who requested the pole was it I think oh oh did he Ellie I do it was although your dad your dad yeah well if if we find it they come down but I know where it is and I that's why I don't want to find it it's and I don't think I'm going back there anytime soon not recently although it's raining near the entrance so I mean like one of us whoever's the fastest the fastest one I volunteer as tribute although can you lift the lord of the feasts body I don't need to lift his body I just need to cut his belt off how long that is well I probably already got thrown in the well really that's the case let me to do is jump in the well doable we can find the fish people this is a later quest I think as you leave the clock tower you do look down slaughter row you could take that down to slaughter stone square if you do want to scope out the situation or you could head back across the marketplace towards the cathedral square I don't want to scope it just like a little look take a look in all right let's wander that way we'll get you onto a roof top you can scope it out you can tell us if you see the lord of the feasts body and if something bad happens pork chops if something bad happens you get out of there like we're already gonna be out of there yeah you don't even need to go near there you're just going close to that I'm just going close so I can like I scope it out and see what if any spirits show up I'm out of there I'm out of there I'm running yeah I can always jump off the building okay so you venture down slaughter row towards slaughter stone square they are running across the rooftops rusty on the streets the streets are littered with the broken bodies of Knowles putted lanterns and a few members of the silver order it seems like as you pass through the through the streets you're regarded by a pair of hooded lanterns who are trying to collect some of their own dead and bring them back towards the clock tower because that seems to be the closest place for most of them you head down slaughter row along the rooftops to where the remnants of the hooded lanterns barricade is omits piles of corpses of Knowles and even you can hear the dying whimpers of a few wounded Knowles still in in the area and down a few of the alleyways you can sense that you might be being watched by some lone strength the stragglers but they dart out of the shadows only to see the three of you and scurry away you made a name for us they know better as you head down slaughter row towards the square and they Oh from the rooftop at the distance you can see as you look out over one of the high steep over rooftops on to slaughter stone square you can see this seated form of the executioner as it and you hear the wrenched metal as the executioner drags several corpses and throws them down the shaft of the cistern and it's moving back and forth picking up several over the bodies and tossing them back down the cistern but as you look out to see to see it it's large axe has been slammed into the ground by the headsman's block and instead it is it has wrapped around its wrists the broken remnants of the Lord of the feasts flail oh and and looking very carefully give me a perception check twelve it looks like parts of the chains are fusing themselves into the executioner's arms which is like totally normal pork chops pork chops such bad pork chops pork chops as you look up the the the form of the executioner there is only there are only two corpses impaled on its body that of the Shiva and the Lord of the feast darn it it has kind of taken the mangled corpse of both of them because the Lord of the feast was beheaded and the Shuvo was bisected and it's kind of mounted them up the parts of it up on its shoulders like a macabre display haphazardly hanging as even the the Lords of the the feasts head dangles on kind of like right beside almost the head of the executioner impaled on a spike beside it do you see the palp I shouted miss I just back away off the roof towards them crawling down the building and I walk up they say guys yeah we're gonna have to fight the corpse collector if we want this this Pelt where's the pail it's on its back he's wearing it he's very fashionable corpse collector now with the pelts all new shoulders got two good shoulder pads I mean you're probably fast enough to just run in there and gray he also has the chains from the his weapon fusing to his arm oh no the flail why he's got a arm now why would you think that was a fun idea why I'm just wondering how he figures out to do it he's obviously more than a robot yeah that shows a sign of intelligence well does he gain the intelligence of the spirits that go into well now we're just making wildest no look okay we will just we'll just kill it with a bigger robot if we've learned anything about our structure we just have to find something bigger in Drakon I'm to lure there's always a bigger fish all right and then we let that problem be figured out by another thing down the road operation find something bigger problems by causing more problems I'm adding it to our list of things to do and Jack and I solve executioners bigger problem we just have to practice and then we can take them on later yes fine okay so we know we know what we're in for we know that we now need to eventually gear up to categorically kill the corpse collector yep for now you guys want to go fight something that isn't a corpse collector knows it's killed orestes Knowles yeah that'll make us feel better maybe two kills an old I really want to feel like an uncompensated good in a fight you know it's it's been a while that chase scene was pretty rough I was falling all over the place me and Pluto ended up on a horse together lessor horse and died to the end true I fell often because my horse although all the horses died those are like the fastest horses also our friends oh maybe we were Pluto you're under estimating the attachment I grew with that horse within that short time that's the first horse I was ever able to ride okay this is a big moment for you Yeah right I named it what it was their name Billy the horse good yeah I think you spent more time bonding with it than naming it I did I just I just wanted you to know that I came up with a name about five minutes ago and yeah pretty sad that's where you pass by the corpse ability to use it with the other I kick it as well I'm like the second dragon I'm horse the second when in tracking hime and I do some horses well give it a food all right guys that's our good luck for the day actually that brought up my spirits I have looked down at Billy one last time and I'm like I'm glad let's go onward so the front door yeah well I have a thought and I hear that it's one of the best strategies when you're planning an infiltration yes we all take different entrances I like that yeah might go for that are you were you were you joking no I have it written down here always split the party just hear me out here damn listen yeah you're probably best hitting up one of those windows probably can I break them I don't care well it should look for one that's already broken the Paladins might be mad but I mean look at the city look at our clock tower eight broken window look look at the building over there that building is a piece of wood and some stones to the ground you know if you break a window we'll just say an old did it they're not gonna know okay they're not gonna show up and be like did you three break that window like know that it was inhabited by Knowles I'll look for a broken one if not I'll break one yeah just find a window entrance Pluto mm-hmm I think you're good at front doors I like the front door it makes me feel welcome and I don't know where I go probably one or the other maybe the other side I can't get to one of those windows though Ohio I think well I will recap for you you arrived at Cathedral Square the whole place littered with the corpses of the trampled Knolls fallen members of the Silver order and the trappings of many dragged bodies and you can see that there are trails of blood and entrails leading back towards the entrance of the Cathedral and as you pass by looking amongst the corpses you can see that there are bits of armour discarded weapons from the silver order but the corpses of the silver order Knights that fell here have been dragged away as have their horses Virgil Virgil was ripped to pieces what about the flame keeper I run to where flame keeper Hannah fell and I start investigating the the ground there so you come around to the front of the grand Cathedral where there are the ruins of the Bacchus tree so the whole plaza around the cathedral is the actual Cathedral of Saint Vitruvius self which is a very large Basilica building almost 500 feet like it's it's gigantic and the height of the building itself is almost you know it's almost 300 feet itself up to the top of the dome because there's the the large kind of basilica front of the of the cathedral itself and in the large Basilica the large dome that rises up over the back to about a height of about 300 feet and then beside it is the bell tower known for the $7 of saying for trivia which rises up about 275 feet not quite as tall as the clock tower but one of the tallest buildings in this part of the city and then in immediately in front of the cathedrals entrance other ruins of the baptistry which looks like a piece the meteor hit here and destroyed the building utterly the building itself is a massive basilica style Cathedral it was made of white marble that was painted in intricate frescoes all across the outside and all across the top of the rooftop our chimneys for in the heyday of most worshippers of the flame there's lots of fire that goes on during the religious tons of candelabras piles of candles and more rising up so always the rooftops are had these high chimneys all going up along them and in fact the the way the windows are here is that there are several arch arch nooks where there are statues looking out of various saints and figures religious figures people who have contributed past flame keepers all going around the sides of the building and the whole mode of the frescoes all around tells the story of the found the the founding faith the foundation of the faith all around it is famous scenes of various martyrs Saints and paladin's being visited by various angels throughout history over each of these scenes there are about 60 feet off the ground there are these large circular stained-glass windows that are all in the shape like that have kind of this wheel like spokes of the glass painting looking into them and they're these three this style of window is also at the very front of the facade so above each of the three doorways our big windows like this above each doorway there are dozens of statues alcoves and niches all around the outside the entire building is incredibly ornate and there are hundreds of figures and statues that decorate the the entire outside of the cathedral many of them have been marred and disfigured particularly the ones that the lower levels but the lower the interestingly enough the lowest window is about 60 feet off the ground are any of the windows visibly broken or busted several of them are damaged there's a there's a couple things that we should do before we just go barging in there of course I can send Crowley to get a little bit of a view and see if he can peek through one of the broken windows mm-hmm but also I'm kneeling over where flame keeper Hannah was are there signs that she was dragged there is a red smear that leads from where she fell to inside the cathedral am i able to determine how long ago the dragging occurred make an investigation check seven sometime between when she died in this moment you're really good at detective work Pluto I was being I because it's relevant so the back half of the Cathedral flares out into several shrines essentially in three kind of bulbs that come out from the dome and each of these bulbs has its rooftop but the windows on the on the south part of the cathedral itself aren't until actually the base of the dome at the center of that so the the window the windows to get into the chancel part of it you need to go up onto the rooftop and then climb partway up the dome to get in all right guys give me one second I'm gonna go Scout for us okay is that it's not cool do you want to do anything before I do that all right well I like where you're at with the checking the bodies so I know we watched Virgil get torn to pieces but flame keeper who is it thank you for Hannah Hannah yeah she she might still be alive and she might be a prisoner yeah seem with any of the other ones so we should watch out for president and try to rescue them this could be a rescue mission and it could involve a shooting the the flare early to maybe get some help to get them out yeah I wouldn't I mean no but uh we'll keep it as a side they can only eat so much like they're probably storing them for I mean we can hope I'm hopeful if we go in there and there are people alive that becomes one of our primary objectives is to get them out you said that their equipment was discarded is any of it maybe like without knowing its true power like did like Virgil sword or flame for Hannah's like ring or something get left behind um flame flame keeper Hannah had a spear and a shield and her spear is here it's snapped in half it was a silver sphere and Virgil's long sword and Lance are on the ground the Lance is broken but his his long sword was made of mithril not magical but made of metal I'm gonna take it just to maybe reunite it with him I mean dorms of the cathedral are closed as well now well that stops our whole plan Pluto I'm gonna I'm gonna go check it out okay okay suddenly the bird I take shadowy crawly off my shoulder and I whisper some stuff in his ear I'm just like hey go check it out okay and then I toss them up into the air and then my eyes roll back in my head and I go into Crowley vision do you can hear as you come up to one of the windows you can hear the sound of low growling and actually the clash of chains and metal and the bitey and and what sounds like a fight and as Crowley perches up in the cathedral you look out into the scene of the cathedral floor this is the the nave and the aisles of the cathedral the worshipers of the flames stand and so there is a great nave here so several hundred feet long borne up by massive pillars of stone to a vaulted ceiling that rises up almost 200 feet over 150 feet overhead sorry the highest point is here is about 200 feet high so where you are the rooftop has been 100 feet up and then it raises up again into this kind of steeple part about 200 feet up make sense yeah yeah and the whole thing is all stone except for the very tops of the roof which are would that even that is all support I would but there's stone arches that are bearing up the whole building itself it's masterful stonework that is about this thing together on the inside is a mosaic the mosaic floor of the grand Cathedral and the white walls had become a charnel-house inside several large tables of various sources have been dragged in here and there are deep rents all across the mosaic floor from clearly the furniture being dragged in here it looks like several wagons have even been dragged inside here carts chests and there are bits of bone splatters of dried blood and fresh blood piles of dismembered corpses and chains butcher chains hanging between all of the pillars that hold up this building the whole room looks like a charnel-house of slaughtered human bodies but also no bodies and other undescribable even parts maybe of a Minotaur and there are several fires that are burning inside the building of which there are bits of meat burning over top of them there are rows upon rows along the aisles of disheveled nests that Knowles have been sleeping in and all of the builds up is that in front of leading up to the altar room is a grand staircase and there is the platform where the sermons used to be delivered to the public and around this platform is a McCobb sight of blood bone body parts assembled treasures and weaponry Lara and then be flanking it are two large graziers and a very large bubbling cauldron and a makeshift throne has been built on the platform of what looks like human skin put up over several bits of bone and several large old chair but behind it a top overlooking the platform is a balcony that the stairs lead up to and overlooking this throne is a macabre effigy made of flesh and body parts in the shape of a bloated humanoid figure with goat-like legs and long and a face that is just several skulls all pressed together and this large jaw that makes the appearance of its face almost indescribable and where its eyesockets would be our two human skulls that are like eyelids that have big pieces of delirium jammed into it and it looks out with these wings that have been made in effigy that have kind of been chained up again of bits of human skin and fur that have been drawn over a mesh of bone and it perches over the throne almost blocking the way into the the shrine at the underneath the dome at the back of the Cathedral before the platform are about half a dozen nulls and two and four of the nulls are standing over the bodies of at least a dozen other nulls and it appears that then the nulls that are here are taking turns biting each other and as you as Crowley looks up one of the nulls is slain by its combat partner and another Knoll steps forth and the two of them begin fighting each other in a completely feral fashion and as this is going on that Knoll increase the robes that you regarded before she is looking she dips her hand in a vial into the cauldron in front of her as she holds out the head of flame keeper Hanna and her blood drips down into the cauldron and the priestess looks over through the the concoction that she's making and looks up to the Noles that are fighting looks at a piece of delirium around her neck that she's also holding and regards these Knolls that are fighting each other and the and the brew that she is creating as well when you say the head of flame to keep her hand oh you mean it's a savage severed yes okay rescue mission failed [Laughter] [Music] so I observed for a few minutes she's not like the Noles that are killing each other she's not resurrecting them they appear to be doing and dying two of the Knowle one of the noses just slain another and the two that the survivor and another null are barking and yapping at each other in a threatening way it looks like they haven't yet come to blows they're kind of killing each other without being brought back so I snap back to Sebastian well guys looks like this problem is taking care of itself the Noles are killing themselves in there or they're probably fighting for whoever's gonna be the next lord of the feast yeah yes and that's it the mission to save flame keeper Hannah is going to be more difficult than anticipated they are using she's got a pretty good head on her shoulders so I really trust that she knows what to do in these situations yep you could say that Pluto you could say that great her head was severed toldja don't get your hopes the only survivors are us well I didn't see anything too crazy in there and nothing that a few arrows they do have there's that priest in there oh I think they need to be diggin Oh first guys I know that we've never been good at this Pluto I'm looking at you okay I'm listening I think they oh if you can get up to one of the windows as quietly as possible and me and Pluto can get up to those doors we're gonna want to double check to make sure those doors aren't locked when I was looking through Croley the doors at the front of the Cathedral did they look barred from the inside or anything they did not know so in theory those doors are able to be pushed open so I think you and I could burst through the doors and catch them off-guard quick yeah if you if you could even get the drop on them with some magic I could and then I could follow first open first then I got an idea yeah before we burst in if--like Rolly down just hurts him right in the middle of them squawking all of them will turn to look at this weird bird yeah and be like what is bird and then we burst in and blow them up can you make Crawley save things I've never tried I don't think I can just sleep through him I don't so you could use minor illusion to make him seem like he's talking yes maybe I could but I would need to kind of be able to see what I'm doing hmm I think that he's enough of the distractions yeah good I like it now does that bring their attention - yeah does that ruin our surprise or does that enhance our surprise we time it perfectly and it will enhance so like as soon as he squawks you're either testing something or I'm throwing something or they are shooting something okay so we all need to get into position now with the windows that are broken is there a perch of some kind or is it essentially the window and then you're in there is a perch because they're in kind of embedded in an alcove looking through the windows none of them are completely destroyed with the windows that you see around you it would probably necessitate to make one a good enough firing platform that you had full range of shooting you probably need to break part of the window first part of it okay yeah or we can all burst them depending on the window I mean we could all burst through the front doors and I'm I'm doing that if you think that the windows gonna be too much of a challenge I'm just worried if somebody hits me and it gives enough force that I'm falling 60 I mean I do that further how many doors are at the front of the geringer redoing interesting it's meant to be a coincidence all burst through I mean that's our classic move and it's never failed us I called dibs on the middle door okay you want mill I'll take the left David yeah I'll do Phil I'll do right operation kick down front door let's sneak up though what's up yeah I mean I'm so loud like just really move at this well that's why I think it's if if I burst through the front door and you can come with me or not but then if they are sneaking around she can maybe get like a couple shots doesn't have to be up in the perch I I say we just moved to the doors like they're not out here they're in there okay if somebody's like walking casually in front of your stone house through thick wooden doors you probably are fighting in there I don't think they're listening it's sure sure there's a lot going on in that so I say we just try to move up without them opening the front doors and being like quit making all that racket okay and then we'd burst through the doors throwing spells throwing arrows throwing everything we have how many were there shooting there were about half a dozen they were standing over a pile of bodies now here's the thing that I'm not sure of that priestess can resurrect people we saw at once yep but I did see one of the nulls kill the other null and waited a minute there and nothing nothing happened do anything I think you know what if she's my target I think if we can get her down first then she at least can't resurrect anymore get her down yeah I gotta focus on her - I will focus on everybody you've got the best area-of-effect stuff yeah yeah hmm laid it up you guys want to do this yep I'll keep them off you guys and I'm gonna focus on getting her they probably heard of us anyways the broad ligament yeah you taught me how to kill mages run away school weird that's true you can kill magic things gonna go kill her please don't kill me okay I promise I won't kill you guys thank you but it's been really hard because you taught me how to do and I haven't been able to do it yet so now I'm gonna go kill her yeah and it's gonna make me feel really good like it's gonna be a big release it's like learning how to cartwheel and not being in with a cartwheel weeks I got a cartwheel all over her gluto I bet you I can kill her before you go my gosh okay oh it's on or tag-teaming we're doing it she's done can we go up to the doors okay guys clunk clunk go tiptoe tiptoe tiptoe I probably louder if I try to tiptoe okay just walk clonk clonk we attempt to approach quietly to the three front doors of the Cathedral okay I'll make self checks Pluto 22 oh that's not good I got a 16 that's the best still check ever made Sebastian I get it 11 wow you're yelling at me yeah you're like well we'll just have to hope that they're distracted by their little internal feud squawkers you're up to the doors which of you will be by which door Center for me okay and I'm gonna give me give me that right action should I be right behind you so that way when you burst cuz you're bursting through right we're gonna go all once burst okay you guys are alive okay imagine all the doors are just fiddling with the door so you stand in front of the cathedral doors the massive double doors of each filigreed with gold and the scenes of angels at creation carved into each these are really big heavy doors you'll be able to push them open though no problem hopefully what are you gonna do so I think we should all do one one door and have me maybe ready with my arrows but if we do all three and two of them don't open we can do two of us can just run through the third door okay I mean I understand your look cool factor but I'm with veo I'm gonna walk over to sebastian i am not strong and i also walk towards your door - and i and and i have that give up look like that's true I just gotta push you aside and I get in front of the door and I look at me and I push you aside and I get in front of the door and I get my leg open it I get my bow ready because I'm like I'm not gonna open this door okay I go first I'm the big strong one you're right okay you want to open it no you go ahead together together it's your moment I feel ready to cast something I got it I'm ready wait wand oh wait my wand wait am I in my County should I Tommy account yeah there you go okay three two one huh you kick open the doors or push the doors open and they open wide with a loud crash roll for initiative yay surprise 24 nice how do you do 18 I got 19 I got 24 yeah cuz this works something my distracting strike will go back to veo on her shots on I'm I'm sassy sassy which lady I can revive people I hope you can revive yourself with a spells decapitated and you're a giant pincushion bring it on okay so establish the order with your stealth checks you have the the no lords the candidate Lords they are surprised but the null priestess who you remember the name Craig hora being yelled by the Lord of the feast she has heard you and she is not surprised fair enough okay like not surprised in context like that were coming to kill her or like not surprised in like the terms of like the stealth not not in terms of the condition the other gnomes are and as you kick open the doors you can see that the two nulls are poet in front of you are all poised to fight but Craig hora herself has this look of almost peace about her unlike the savagery of the other Knolls and you can see that the robes that she wears are tattered and dirty but they are the robes of a flame keeper and you can see that around her neck is the seal and the prayer beads of the high flame keeper of Dragon Knight so there is an amulet of prayer beads that she is wearing that has the seal of the city and the symbol of the sacred fire and she bears that around her and she's almost holding it in like that prayer like pose I think I go before cleaner oh you do the church er okay all righty are we ready though you're up first what are you gonna do so the null beside her is surprise correct all the nulls are surprised but she is not okay I'm then cuz I see the look on her face and like nope and I I just to to the knoll beside her to get advantage okay first 11 as the shot rings forward it bounces off the chainmail armor worn by the change shirt worn by the null hmm is it advantage on all the shots in this room they can see you so you're not hidden so you just have an advantage on on the attack it like you cast as at first I kid you not know I thought it was cuz I'm surprised you only get surprised because of the nature of your surprise yeah they can still see you so you still have to be hidden from the enemy right in order to gain oh sorry yeah okay um joinery role that want to know what were the results on both the day six and one six and one I neither would hit then anyways okay so I got one more than well it's still surprised round so you got your gloom stalker shots yeah another six cool cool and then five no no I'm not hit not any of these so as the door opens up vales arrows fly into the cathedral and go wide just a casual hide the doorway I mean one of you go I like hide beside the door okay let me do like the left um I walk into the room and I yell your boss is dead my name is Sebastian Crowe and I'm in charge here now and you're all fired and and I whip out my wand and throw a fireball right into the middle of all of the Noles you said that there was like a big pile of NOLA bodies there no I launched it right into the middle of the null bodies so you want to hit these five Knolls down in front yeah okay because the fireball erupts with a lower roar in the middle of all the feasting tables and there's like plates and entree there's an entree of on trails on one of the tables and the fireball just erupts in flame engulfing five of the Noles and what do I need to save it's a 16 D 16 only one of the nulls succeeds on a saving throw the one closest to you I am going to use a sorcery point to re-roll four of those days okay that's good reroll yeah all right yes pretty solid 34 damage whoa okay so all four four of the nulls these nulls are substantially larger than the others it looks like they've been gorging themselves on the fallen all of them survived the fireball Oh No the four of them in the middle are bloodied and scorched but they still stand and they turn with a look of rage on their faces as the fire dissipates and I see all of the nulls still standing I kind of look over my shoulder and make eye contact with Pluto and I'm like oh man do something and Pluto is my turn oh well here we go ha I run in I let it like a sigh and I pull out my trusty I'm gonna use um I I yell for Virgil and I'm gonna pull out Virgil's longsword and just just point and charge and charge it the closest Knoll and just give it a big old swing and 22 hit for 14 damage that leaves him bloodied and I'm gonna try to finish him with a 15 to hit it just bites through his change shirt it's a hit for 12 damage he's still standing and I'm gonna slam into him with my shield to knock him prone for a 17 uh he gets an 18 why so strong uest stands it wounded and burned the Knoll withstands your onslaught and then I grit my teeth okay here we are we're doing it good good job guys good job good job outside grigora turns and a lick of fire reflects across her eyes and she opens her hands and a wall of fire is conjured along the back wall no fire [Music] anyway it is facing that way no it's hot it's so hot and so it's it's gonna appear basic effectively on your ear so you're not in the area of it Sebastian because she's conjuring it to block the exits but it is burning towards you Sebastian and she she's then with that she gestures to the other Knowles who are still surprised though for this round so we go to the top with Vale so I peek my head around the door and I say ah there's a wall do I see any windows above me there are windows above you but these windows are 80 feet up and a hundred feet up respectively because they're above the high doors okay and you said there are 60 feet up on the sides correct yeah how tall are the doors the doors themselves are 15 feet tall and how tall is the wall fire the wall of fire is 20 feet high oh man so it's in God's totally takes up the door and it's right across the front there's no way for me to climb over inside correct it's blocking all the doors okay 60 feet up here I'm going to use my feline agility to get to the side and I'm gonna start to climb to one of the windows okay on the edge climbing speed cannot be dashed correct you could - sure climb climb speed so you're gonna go to the side - one of the first windows yep so the first window is here yep so however much movement it cost you to get there and then you can - from that okay how much is that approximately one two three four five six seven eight nine it's butthen squares so 50 feet okay um so that is at least my walkin and then I can I guess - as a my action whatever your hook shot to start well actually I could - as my cutting action as my bonus action mmm and then I can use the rest of the way as my hook shot yeah you could yeah so you can fire that and you fire the hook shot and it brings you right up to the window Suites nice is it a broken window it is harsh it is broken but you will you will need to smash it to get essentially from your vantage point you can fire straight you've basically got a firing lane right here but in order to fire into the room you would need to break the window okay yep okay okay that's it Sebastian you're up so I'm not being hurt by the flames I just can't back up in let you'll only be hurt by the flames if you stay there yeah okay Sebastian the pillar darts behind one of the pillars and looks out from behind it and it's like Pluto I hope you're ready and I'm always ready um once again black time girl shoot out of my hand and start wrapping themselves around Pluto and slowly morphs into a shadowy t-rex in the middle of the room [Laughter] Jurassic Park banner drops down [Laughter] and I duck and cover okay pollute oh it is your turn you are a t-rex I accept my new forms and my hunger for no flesh as I let out a mighty roar [Music] start finishing off the first Knoll that was very great in front of me okay yeah you got a bite in a tail attack but you just can't make them against the same target so I'm gonna bite for a 25 to hit okay those forty twelve plus seven piercing damage you think I got him do you mean poor dice I do just about you're not using my b12 so every fifty 1233 damage yeah the Noles most of it is gone wait a single bite just just legs I treat him like the lawyer and and then I'm gonna do I'm gonna start to charge forward and give the one on the table a tail attack a standing on the table you get off the table and I crit him oh man that's 3d 8 plus 7 so you might have been 68 he's just gonna be two more two more deets please and thank you so 19 plus 20 37 damage but the tail lashes out smashes him in the in the chest breaking his rib cage and sending him flying into one of the pillars where he splatters spraying limbs and gore across the room and then I let out one big like roar again like it's very intimidating I'm adding the pillar just like it worked it's working it's working this time thank you for all the days cool thank you for being a t-rex alrighty so uh we now go to grigora who cast dispel magic on the t-rex no i counterspell okay oh she now Unni are you up casting counter spell what i would have to do i think it doesn't matter if it's an up cast spell so i'm gonna have you in this case we'll look it up afterwards because she has to up cast dispel magic she uses a fourth level slot didn't spell your polymorph but i want i ahead are you gonna up cast it or not i love cast it if it's gonna just nullify it it will if you if you use a fourth level slot will say it nullifies it outright done i don't know if a third level spell slot if a third level spell nullifies the third level spell regardless of what level they're cast at but i don't i'm too lazy to when you cast the spell using a spouse lot of fourth level or higher the interrupted spell has no effect if it's level is less than or equal to the level you use yeah but i don't know whether it's that the spell magic is a third level spell but i'm not casting it to fourth yeah so what a third I'll just use a fourth level spell slot we'll look at after yeah that takes care of it okay so the counter spell a little bit of counter magic actually I got I got a I got a you know what I gotta check it check you on one last thing well before we let it go are you within 60 feet of her do you ever measuring I am not sixty feet right there you saw your fourth level small slide seems should remake me she dispels so the dispelled does go through yep dispel gone through technicality I'm not a t-rex anymore man you keep killing my T Rexes yeah I spit out as human Pluto a big chunk of no warming back in oh my god what was i eating okay and seeing this once intimidating t-rex reduced to a mere man no the three Knowles dog pile up Olivia Jackson epic flying of Knowles I pictured it like and the last Knoll comes around the side and viruses longbow at at Sebastian Sebastian so Sebastian you're gonna take too long bow shots I'm ready that's gonna be a 22 and a 704 10 points of damage long bow that's a good hit and the three Knowles rush in towards Bluto hello attacking with their claws and their bites pre they've got an assortment of weapons glades flails and each of them rips into you Pluto so we got a 21 and a 22 both hit and a 10 from the first one so the first guy comes in slashes at you with his claws and that is going to be a grand total of 15 points of slashing damage the next rips in as well getting a 23 and a 7 and a Wow 24 23 and 24 walk claw and bite Wow a claw and bite hit for another 11 points of damage mass gets double natural ones on his claws and a 2 on the die the last one stumbles across a table it's just like reaching out towards you as he claws across the table it's still intimidating alrighty wow that was fun you're okay and they oh you can make a perception check 1515 there is something hiding in the rafters yeah you see a ruffling and there are some feathers that you can see in the rafters some sort of large bird is perched up in the rafters of the very top you can again the ceiling is very high here and it's not as illuminated as the rest of the space so your dark vision doesn't quite get that far but you can see that there's this flittering shape of a large bird of prey in the rafters of our bazooka eight heartbeats allergic to their feathers I sneeze yeah is that your telltale you'll know what it is if you start sneezing can do I have I guess a line of sight where I could pick it out through the window or I stop smashing it around yeah and you saw it kind of fly through the the overhead rafters and arches out towards where you and Sebastian are okay but I still won't be able to get it through the window you dive-bomb but it's it's approximate position so if you imagine the roof top comes up like this and then comes up like this so where you are on the roof like if we're thinking three dimensionally it's hard for you to see anything that's up over here okay okay I'm still gonna think to do what I thought I was gonna do so I see this bird but I'm still seeing Pluto get pounded on by these Knowles and then I see this also this big guy come in here correct uh yeah so from your vantage point you have a clear shot to the Knowles here in the middle and the Knoll over there but not to the priestess oh I do have a clear shot to them you would have a clear shot to the one like the ones in front here with the way or the way the pillars in the building and the 3d architecture is so yeah if you break the window you could probably shoot any of them okay but from where you're I think you need you might have to jump down to be able to get clear shots to the priestess okay I've got a I've got an idea so what I'm thinking is I know I have to break this window I know have magic to help me land softly if I want to as a reaction I'm thinking can I use my movement to rush through the window and shoot as I'm in the air yes yeah you've got two options if you want to smash it bodily into the window and fall down as you as you do so you can either accept disadvantage on your attack roles okay or you will take slashing damage from the breaking window I will take slash so just like okay these guys need help okay cats always land on their feet and I okay so as you burst through the window roll a d6 to determine how many shards of glass cut you three okay so three d8 damage how did you shoot the green flare you take 17 slashing damage as it as you crash through the window a large shard of glass basically catches your back and slashes a deep gash across your back as you break through the window okay I'm like ah but then I and I'm aiming towards the Noles that are against Pluto okay start to take some shots yeah there's a shower of glass that that drops that drops down you the the shards of glass breaking and falling beside Sebastian and I'm gonna as my bonus action casts Zephyr strike okay so I can get advantage on okay at least one shot I'm gonna let you know this yep because if you cast a spell as a bonus action you cannot cast another spell on your same turn except for a hand trip with a casting type of one action which would prevent you from casting feather fall okay I will not cast ever straight this I know you wanted yeah I know I'm not dying okay so I will just shoot there there 21 that's a hit Wow the one that has the flail kind of in the air okay and these guys are still kind of hurting from the fireball oh yeah they're all bloodied 21 damage the arrow lands rate in his neck and he drops to the ground dead oh that feels cool and I'm gonna take one more shot at the other guy with 21 to hit yes Oh max damage yeah 25 it hits him right through the heart in the yeah the arrow Pierce's at the front and then I can cast as I'm falling him like Oh comes in as my reaction I still have your bonus action which you can cutting action something today oh okay which you could like use it to - or anything else options um yes I am going to dash across the room I have if I dash I have 60 feet total okay see - over here yeah that's unless you know the fall doesn't count against you so yeah you definitely have enough movement to get over to here cool that's good yep you just hear this cat explode through a window yeah and two nulls died in front of me yeah the speed is such that you're not sure whether the shots were fired here or here as she ran across like it's not exactly clear when because by the time she gets over here the nulls are still falling to hit the ground [Laughter] Sebastian it's your turn Sebastian runs up and hops onto this table and it's kind of wobbly himself any points at the priestess and he yells I'm sending you back to hell and I'm gonna use sorcery points and a little portal opens up in front of her and a demon dog even dug grim now leaps out or Reaper Reaper Reaper and grant leaps out and attacks does he get to attack on the turn that I summon yep well yeah but after your turn is over okay so now that that's happened let's see wonderful with Reaper up against her she has disadvantage on saves against my spells so I fling a web at her web blorp okay and she and she rolls her save against that at the start of her turn correct yes with disadvantage because of yeah anything else you'd like to do on your turn bonus action actually moving everything's done yeah that was bonus action action and movements okay yeah Pluto you're up or weight can Reaper attack yeah Reaper might as well get that attack in 20 that's a hit nice Reaper bites into her while she's getting tangled up in the webs for six damage okay does she make her concentration check she does okay do we need to kill her well I mean is it do we need speed on this my question is is she a mutated from or from the human where she actually an OLE Yeah right hmm questions guess we can ask the matter I'm gonna hit this Knoll with my sword oh I get an 11 that is a Miss he blocks the attack I'm gonna swing again for a 13 a hit solid hit for 12 damage he barely stands I'm gonna use my bonus action to push him away for a twenty six he gets a 18 so I'm gonna push him five feet away okay and then I'm gonna rush at the priest lady as far as I can as much as I can get okay gracias and that's so I'm going after truck was the gap it is her turn she has disadvantaged on her saving throw against the web's getting a big old 9 she is entangled in the web yeah entangled back in the webs she grits her teeth and a bead of flame originates in her hand as she hurls a fireball at Sebastian inve oh no bang it hits the last remaining I counter spell bat today I see the fire coming towards me and then it's like yeah yeah got my wand and the fireball just like evaporates into my wand and I'm like standing there a concerned cat nice I gotcha she looks perturbed at that there's no stopping us today and so she is entangled in the webs in that as you absorb the magic from the counterspell [Music] figure leaps down from the rafters above guys I think we're doing pretty well oh and as it it flies down oh no it's screeches out emitting a horrific scream and veil and Sebastian I need both of you to make Constitution saving throws 5:20 Sebastian you succeed there you fail you're stunned by the screech as this awful creature that it looks like someone took a vulture and ripped out spindly limbs from its breasts from the breast of the vulture and extended its legs and grew it forth to monstrous proportions it has boiling purplish skin and these dirty grey modeled feathers coming up from its back and these awful tail feathers this horrible amalgam of vulture imp like goblin creature as it has this gnarled beak of a face that screeches out as it flies down oh no that leaves veo stunned and the last surviving null is that still - no he got fireball oh no he didn't get fireball did he I absorbed it yeah okay so he's still alive he got pushed he gets up the first no rushes over towards Pluto Jackson hello this one yeah dropping his longbow and attacking with his claws getting an 11 and a 9 and a 19 with his so close okay but I I'm able to keep him away and the the other null also races towards pollute Oh leaping over the table getting a 11 and a 16 and a 22 with the bikes that's a good one that's a good one the white does five points of damage as he leaps over the table bites into your shoulder Wow my shoulder nice seriously and we go to the top of the round with Vail who is stunned I'm stunned so I'm incapacitated I can't move I can't act so I just stand there like it's a bird is there anything I can do as an action to be unfund under the effects of the stunning screech you are hanging on to your head as it resounds out through your mind it seems like you'll be able to shake it off after this terminal okay so I'm just still like Sebastian you're up all right wobbly table I hop off the table back here and yeah Crowley comes flying in from his perch and flies up to this dude right here just back into the back of the head of that Knoll and I'm going to cast a scorching ray do you do you pull out my wand and I pointed a bad Knoll and I'm like cruelly geta they give you advantage right that's exactly why I did that oh hey cool all right I'm going to use a sorcery that's a little better that is 11 damage alrighty he's still up he actually has not been wounded at all yet oh he was the rogue one on the side right when I shot that and I missed three times I'm a survivor he's gonna make it oh I'm gonna shoot him again okay that is gonna be a 19 it hits for eight more damage okay nice and my final shot hits for 99 more damage okay he is bloodied well done I'm ducking behind here hoping of the bird didn't as the barrage of flame reaches out towards him Pluto it's your turn I'm kind of surrounded but I'm still not in reach of grigora am i no you were not she's still a little bit ahead of me yep she's she's based with at least the Hound right oh right the Hound can the Hound attack oh yes it can I keep forgetting sorry I'm trying to get to her like I'm trying to close the distance my wolf would have an advantage if you were next to and things keep dying around me which is helpful 14 you do have advantage if she's stuck in the web right thanks guys 18 that's a hit Reaper bites down into her and she falls prone in the web's because she gets knocked over yeah and that's seven more damage she succeeds your concentration check oh that's better all righty Ludo you're up I'm gonna try to make it to her I'm gonna take a couple hits from the Noles yep you'll need to take at least one opportunity attack the far north he gets a twenty two hit that's it already he claws into you as you run past dealing six points of slashing damage he gets me in the back again and I and I kind of stumble but then like I catch myself and I'm just gonna just drive Virgil sword into her prone cool you've got advantage twenty twenty-one to hit that is a hits for eight damage okay I'm gonna hit her again for a like a 25 to hit for 12 damage okay that one I want to do a I want to it's a natural one on our concentration check all of fire dissipates yeah and I go Sebastian taught me this and I want to use one of my I'm gonna use distracting strike on that so she takes an extra three damage and the next attack against her that's not me is advantage the attack has advantage is a different maneuver oh my oh you know what I'm gonna use manoeuvring attack and I'm gonna let Sebastian you can move up to half your move on a reaction if you want oh cool and you just don't provoke from her okay and I'm gonna action surge nice I'm just gonna keep on and I crit she's gonna take another 12 damage okay that leaves her bloodied critical blow leaves her bloodied and it's 17 to hit also a hit and now when I'm gonna use another superiority dice and I'm going to do another maneuvering attack and that was 11 damage okay is she dead yeah she is still alive I'm just stabbing her in the wood yeah I know how to kill me just why would you die and bonus action just gonna hit her with my shield just hit her and she is already at her own because I'm just like wailing bash bash nice okay so it is her turn okay why won't you die okay she uh she's gonna go out like a boss she is going to up cast fireball using a fifth level spell slot rate in in the midst there getting herself and all the others in in the aura and myself yeah yeah oh you can all make dexterity saving throws her eyes fail she fails her own saving throw I got Oh 1111 that's a failure I get a 13 also a failure that is gonna be 39 fire damage Oh No and she dies herself blown up by her own fireball as do the Knowles I just Reaper make the save yes okay and the annex does grim make the save Crowley curly probably not Crowley is blown away by the fireball as well as are the other two nulls as she as she howls out and and in her her who she cries at the last words an infernal I'll see you in the pits so neither of us got to kill her technically I think I like to think I cook because I also died I'm also at zero you died we got zero I had exactly 39 points I could have I guess used my bonus action instead of slamming her to heal but it was funnier to slam her in hindsight all right who's up yeah the the bird seeing the this situation the the rock it flies forward towards her remains and pulls the amulet off of her no stoppin flies back up into the rafters what no wait see where it goes you can see it's up there yeah oh it is your turn um am I still stunned no knots done whoo okay I say you know what you may not have gotten you know burned in the fire but I'm gonna make a skewer out of you and I take my bow and I cast is ever strike as a bonus section 15 that is a hit 27 damage nice yeah that was a terrible and I take my second shot at it 12:13 that is a miss I'm afraid it goes wide darn it good track betray and I use oh no I'm sorry use my bonus section I just kind of slink behind the table alright you can watch Sebastian you're up so it's flying up to the rafters holding a amulet yeah yeah it is 40 feet it is it had to fly 60 feet to get there and a 60 feet up in the air I run and like power slide over to Pluto and I cradle Pluto in my arms and I take a potion of healing which I believe I have I hope I have one oh yeah I have a greater healing potion and I'm gonna feed it to them okay but I'm also gonna quick in a spell okay so I feed him a healing potion and I look up at the rafters and I'm like you can fly but can you swim and I'm gonna try to polymorph the frog into a fish so that it drops the amulet and then I'm gonna attempt to catch the amulet it's a wisdom saving throw yes magic resistance yeah and it gets a 15 not enough fish and the amulet drops okay I'm gonna try to catch the amulet make an Xterra tea check 14 catch it and the fish falls and so it takes falling damage so it takes a 60 feet fall it takes 30 falling damage eyes turning it back into a froth turning it back right because the fish has one hit point so it all carries over and bloodied and angry rock is now on the ground beside your back how much health was that on a grater 20/20 Minds prone on the ground I'm by the way when I come over and you open your eyes and I'm looking into them I look like crap like I'm bleeding out of everywhere are you okay buddy Oh oh my gosh did I kill it no okay I don't know I need help I stand up I stand up and I without try without missing a beat like I was just stabbing a lady in the web and then I stand up and I just see this bird and I just start stabbing it okay is it prone it is prone Virgil's sword guide me I get a 24 to hit that hits for 11 damage nice seems like even though Virgil sword is well made it can't penetrate the demonic hide of this creature ah as well it does damage it but not that much so I stab it with the sword can I throw the sword aside and pull out the javelin yeah and you jam it so on the second I go oh this this bird needs a lesson or two in sharing 26 the hit also a hit for 12 damage okay magic damage I know and I'm gonna stand over its its body and this time I'm going to use a second wind okay with the old bonus action getting a 15 health alrighty the rock leaps to its feet and reaches out with its talons and its beak to attack Hey attacking pollute Oh getting a 21-2 hits ow that hits with its talons doing ten points of slashing damage it then attacks with its Talon again getting a 16-2 hits miss and its beak it lashes out to bite at Sebastian's arm that is gripping the the amulet getting a 13-2 hit like a shield and then I'm gonna stab it with a sentinel Sentinel at 12 that is a Miss it does not penetrate a time alrighty top of the round with Vale still taking shots I'm like why won't you die uh a 23 to hit that is a hits 18 damage nice as it begins to lift off to try to fly away Oh 909 it that is not a hit to Sebastian what are you I'm gonna just I pull out my wand and I just try to stop it from taking off by blasting it with a fire bullets okay go for it 26 that is a hit eight more damage seems like it's resistant to fire I come back over here Pluto bring it on home bring it on home steady steady 21 to hit what happens as it tries to take off I'm gonna stab my javelin through it's like upper thigh and just kind of like bring it back to the ground so it goes through like it's its upper thigh and it's leg and as it gets on the ground I'm just gonna grab its head and just snap it nice and just and kill this bird thing and

we've worn on the stream like troll killer as well as our bestseller yes SES so take a look at them designed by us and I hope you join me it's mostly yeah and with that we return to the ruins where a silent Paul hangs over cathedral square once more as the last of the Knowles and their demonic companion lay dead in the charred and fireball main hall of the grand Cathedral of st. petrulio surrounded by piles of gore butchered Knowles and the flayed and torn up remains of the silver order members who were part of the raid that fell here and all manner of spoils that the Knowles have collected in their time ruling the center and heart of dragon hein the great throne that the lord of the feast had made the effigy which looms over top this massive bloated demonic figure with wings spread wide and human skulls for eyes bearing Shara's of delirium in their teeth loom out sick and twisted blasphemy in the heart of this whole once holy place as you lick your wounds I'm hurt let's drop our guard and have a short rest I can drop no i can i can summon us a little protective barrier to actually have a short rest special a very important question for you yeah when when were you gonna tell me that you could turn things into fish yeah you can't you can't just do that in front of her just throw that I don't know yeah I tried it for the first time just now so when was I gonna tell you right now when I found out I could I just try turning people into things that I've seen before I turned him into it into a dinosaur monster because I saw one what was her name you turned the rock into a fish because you're like bird fish bird veil has birds fish veil likes Bert fish it was a logical action nice bird fish fish bird distracted slightly perfect for a second so do you guys want me to bring up a little Hut for us to sleep in okay I know that you're fine mrs. I smashed through windows Knowles while I'm in the air but do you want like a healing potion I have a healing potion I also want to grow back I wouldn't mind a little short rest if we can afford it though we didn't even put the flares oh yeah you should shoot that green flare to let them know we're going into the Cathedral I'm gonna just calmly walk over like all the corpses and stuff towards the entranceway and I just like like I forgot do you want to do a rest and then do the flare because if the flare brings more people yeah they disturb our rest it looks like we just took a really long time to do the first part took us an hour all right I am I go and I sit on one of the chairs the comfiest looking chair is there and there's like meat on these tables but probably human meat it's definitely people I pick it up and I go to eat it and then I look around at all the corpses and I'm like that's probably Virgil well can we resurrect him from this smells like pork chops I'm gonna storm in a little tiny Hut okay guys come on where are you gonna conjure it in the middle of the blood and gore okay guys come lay on the gore come in the gore before before I go into the hut I want to check the lady's body that we grabbed grigora okay other than the amulet is there anything there little remains of her except for charred remains having imploded herself from her own fireball the the broken and bruised remains of a flame keepers robe are all she was wearing as well as she had like a dagger on her person in her end the it seems like she had several defaced holy symbols that had had a Ching's of demonic runes grafted onto them symbols of power and worship calling out to fiendish in worlds beyond rather than the sacred flame and the prayer beads of the high flame keeper of Drakon hein she was wearing them which now Sebastian holds in his hands okay and any sign of Hannah or Virgil or at least like their remains like maybe there are more yes sir best left to the imagination what remains of them but you can certainly spend a bit of time to figure out you know it's it's bad my idea was to bring like a token back like Virgil's sword and if there's something we can bring back up Hanna you find flame keeper Hanna's holy symbol okay I'll take that I'm sitting on a chair inside of my tiny Hut and I'm gonna I take the prayer beads and I'm gonna try putting them on does anything they are magical these these prayer beads so the this amulet essentially is a large phylactery with several silver beads embroidered all along it and then essentially the it has similar construction to the badges of jacket I'm the large shield but in place of this the symbol of the city essentially layered over the symbol of the city is the symbol of the sacred fire almost as if the flame is engraved on it to protect the city itself and as you put it on the it is magical in nature the various kind of hanging charms of it all ringing out as conduits for holy magic but this the magic of it rejects you oh I was weird it's too late for you no you cannot attune to this item well here let me put it on oh are you in the hut now yeah I'm coming you're walk-in and I'm like sucks here you try this on yeah I also come into the hut and I sit down but not on chair just on the ground okay there's dead bodies all over okay it really doesn't I mean it's just not the worst place we slept yeah it's definitely not the worst place absolute right putting these on they they felt uncomfortable on me so maybe they'll feel uncomfortable on you too then we can rejoice in our uncomfortableness yeah holy prayer beads if you spend the rest of your short rest investigating them it seems like the nature of the magic of this of this badge is that only a flame keeper can attune to it just they're so not for any of us can I also spend my short rest resurrecting Crowley you could do you can cast their casting that will take an extra hour because their ritual to summon your familiar takes one hour how long is a short rest one hours 72 hours yeah curly off to bring him back he fought well he's a brave he's a brave bird yeah he did you did it is good you good it's been an hour yeah if you spend your short you spend your short rest in the protection of the dome warded by it when I I want to come out of the hut and start inspecting the raised section before the statue okay before the effigy it is not a statue because it's not native it's made of meat bone and wood this thing the meat statue meat statue it smells really bad as well just the the air and this whole thing is you being inside Sebastian's magic dome the air is clean inside and so when you step out of it like the the smell of the whole area around temple gate it smelled like death before so the the the kind of that air of kind of dead meat in the air wasn't as a parent but once you step out it's like Oh smells like blood and gore and of course nothing is rotting but just that smell of death hangs in the air yeah and also there's like lots of null fecal matter in the corners and yeah the familiars know the smell of the old piss we've read that on ourselves before we're very from surrounding the around the platform here our all manner of treasures that the Noles have a mask over time swords weapons various bits of equipment in varying states of repair but also a fair amount of gold small bits of treasure silver silverware and other odds and ends and bits of treasure that they have amassed and collected over the years I just start dragging my bag of holding through the gold and treasure like waking up the tables is just like Shh you know when you're like cleaning up leaves like I'm doing that I'm helping to like I'm just just shoveling it in how much do we get it's uncountable all told there's there are a fair amount of objects that are here the the one that you can find in and amongst all of the other things that you find are where I have it sorry I have it written down here I just have to pull out let's play a game start throwing gold coins and I'll try to catch them in the bag huh yeah nope fun will last about is still hucking like I'm throwing big and like I'm looking through like silverware big shiny throw it in anything shiny anything shiny possibly anything that looks like it belonged to a human is shiny enough I think it's somebody's glass eye good Virgil or the class sign is that as mustache get the mustache no sorry that's just burn old hair sure what's in this what's in the priestesses like potion here it one touch it there was should I touch it no no don't why are you getting a night why you didn't that redrawing she's saying don't oh I don't know I just how do you know what it is if you don't touch it I'm gonna do a lap and just try to secure the air yeah oh and shoot the I'm gonna go shoot the who you agree to shoot the flare so I'm gonna go outside and just give and very very stoic Lee now like what was the the green one green flare the second green was when it's cleared downstairs to make sure that's clear first I think that before yeah before we announce it's clear we should maybe check out the rest of the Cathedral maybe we should deal with the effigy you have this statue looks it probably wasn't made by the people that made the Cathedral my eye it looks may be made by the Noles afraid of like skin and bone I know there I know that you're not from here but I can I can guarantee that this is a new addition to the Cathedral well I'm a Mason by trade and judging by the work of Bones versus stonework this was added after I'm a historian thank you for the light caspian history my full this seems to be escaping me right now of all the of all the things that are in amongst here but there are several art objects that several smaller statues bits of golden where golden statues bracelets amulets and other phylacteries there's about five larger intact pieces they're each worth about 250 gold pieces and another thousand gold pieces in coins and smaller gemstones as well how do you want to divvy that up 325 each with 25 left over you you take the 25 I think that both me and Pluto have taken overages in the past in and amongst the cauldron are also several bits of all chemical ingredients and in addition to seven shards of delirium each worth about a hundred gold pieces Sebastian as you're looking through the Oh chemical ingredients ingredients that are assembled here are uncannily familiar these are uncannily familiar what are they all the components to make the concoctions in Oscar yarns notes that you've been given to the Queen are here coincidence probably not let's just assume that they were trying to make also potions for the Queen but how would they learn that what what they have been brewing here seems to have the addition of human blood and bone to it and a few other highly toxic components that you would that are you scary even for the concoction that you that you were making before yeah I'm not going to touch this I want to get a vial to analyze it you should because my thought is like we always thought Oscar was making these but what if something is instructing these things that that's how Oscar learned I have a theory I'm gonna pull out a vial and I don't know some clamps or tongs and like take a sample cork it pop it in my bag and then I'm gonna step towards the where the throne is and look up at this effigy does it look familiar to me uncannily so after kind of eyeing it up and down I and look back at both of you hello demon the effigy begins to breathe and now it's going to try to take the Delirium out of its eyes your and the the mouths of the eyes clack as it opens and blinks them and the various jaws and skulls in its body all begin to speak in whispering tones forming one coherent voice well it's been a ride we haven't heard from you in some time I tried to reach out a couple times you weren't answering my calls how things been with you busy I'm sorry to leave you hanging it's cool is this a new rendition of you that we're seeing like you weren't always here no I wasn't always here but he looks across regards out it seems like you've made a slaughter of those who put me together here didn't you just send in more souls your way friend you know he's better to be my friend than my enemy so I'm just going to go with that until he asks everything but there's some goo down here I have a vial of it are you are you kind of giving this recipe out is this your doing cuz I you were in your Oscar yarns place and now you're here both places were brewing the same potion from delirium this you're doing I have many eager students of late what or you teach you if you'd like to learn oh I already know how to make this actually learned on my own smart guy really would you like to know more if you figured it out for yourself I'm impressed it's a keen mind you have there maybe you could master some of the more difficult concoctions this mind is not for sale yeah what do you know about contacting other planes don't worry I'm not interested in your mind what are you interested in you can keep your mind I am interested in a much more different type of currency my soul that sounds like a compelling offer but from what I understand there's already a mortgage out on yours let's say what Oh what can you elaborate on that no they did a credit check and it turns out you're you oh so well that's neat so you can't have my soul carrot-top who has your soul but you've got two others you can bargain with here No Deal No I deal with my self and myself only these two are out of the question but you can't be they should speak for themselves what he said no no no my soul is for my feline self what's on the table mr. demon effigy and I'm not giving up your soul let's hear the demon speak didn't we already hear those sort of demons I like to just I just like to hear what he has to say what what's my soul gonna get me what is it that you desire are you looking for what you want in in this Cathedral you go walk and get it yeah we I don't know if you can give me what I desire PMON statue everyone has a price and I'm sure you might be interested in accruing some interest on investments those really times no no I don't do deals with demons I murder demons and although your path seems tantalizing and very easy I choose the long way well at the end of that long way is darkness all the same but at least I'll have a little bit of a light during my path sorry believe what you will sorry demon no sale you like this town don't you my only place I've ever been so the people that were here yes yes not the ones that were just here a minute ago but for the most part yeah a lot of the other people you would give your life to save this city I would give my life to save aspects of this city I'll do what's I don't think it's always that easy my trade my life yes and you would trade your life it seems to me that the price of a soul is only one step further you don't know what lies beyond and I can tell you that yes you would suffer but then you would this price of the soul is a bargain that pays dividends if you are willing to keep that investment for some time but you said my soul is off the table because somebody else has claimed to it so I can't offer you my soul can you tell me who has claim to it perhaps I can undo that so I can offer it to you the credit check shows that there's only a hold on that's not who has it I would very much do you like games demon you might not like playing games with me okay we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do this I'm gonna say a name and you're going to say whether you know where they are or not mouse [Music] that's a good guys I'm really uncomfortable I'm starting to sweat here just at you over I mean I'm sure if he falls apart we can just I kind of like step back off the platform after saying that with the laughter it's kind of mocking you is that it yes no mr. laugh like did you assist someone else tell you a joke to another effigy it's like you're picking up on multiple phone lines I know speak I didn't think you had quite that sense of humor she with you she's suffering whose Mouse statue is she she's the one that I sent to hell when I was in school then got expelled that's that's heavy yeah remember that story yeah I do now yeah and then what your prayer Pete's back they don't work with me prayer is not gonna save me man would you like to freer yes well you can't sign the deal but if your friends are willing to co-sign I'm not I'm not forfeiting my new friends for my old friends that just puts me in the same position I was willing to put myself out there you were the one that wanted to play a game before but the choice really isn't yours if you two would like to help out your old friend maybe we can play some little bet no I'm not asking no good uh what kind of bet I like your soul where it is Thanks sorry but I don't know your friend I don't expect either of you two to give up your souls for my mistake that is my burden it was not yours I think we need to now find out who owns your soul so we can get it back yeah this just keeps getting more complicated every time I talk to this team in got more confused I could grant you your wish not you why do I talk to you if your friends are willing to gamble their souls you win I'll grant your friends each a wish if I win and I'll grant you and I will release her soul and if you lose well I would have their souls but if when your bodies are done if we win they keep their souls if we win they keep their souls we each got a wish and you give me my friend back you don't get much okay they get a wrench and I get my friend back what are we betting on [ __ ] what are we betting on a soul what are we bet what's the game if it's something I think I can win she doesn't want to play the game no scaredy-cat we could win but we could also lose is this the same sort of lining that you got you two trapping your friend and the hell is that we could win no I thought it would be cool to impress everybody if I summon a demon and it didn't I wasn't you like showed up that day wasn't was that you that took her it's funny how we keep running into each other [Music] he's your oldest friend if you change your mind and wants to play a little game sometime you know what's at stake and if you want to cash your chips in and lay them on the table then I'll deal you in and tell you the game how do we how do I contact you because I'm pretty sure I'm going to destroy the Statue once you're gone you know my number my soul was available last time we talked was it claimed between the last time we talked and now we're how was it always claimed and you were just messing with me maybe he's messing with you now just so then you bet your friends souls instead of your own the guys we could well demon as usual it's been a pleasure you make a compelling I don't know your you never give me the full story it's very upsetting sure we'll run into each other again in the future I'm soon he's gonna have no more followers cuz we're gonna kill them all do we do we tear down a statue of a oh yes we're going to pick apart and destroy this effigy and I'm going to as you wish to part it laughs the entire time I take the Delirium out of the ice we're more after the did the case these are large crystals you want me to carry them holding so two more crystals guys it's really frustrating they were fragments it's really frustrating being at the doorway that I could bring my friend back from where I sent her but there's this jerk in the way well it's the bouncer it sounds like if you summoned him once and he took her away when you were young what if you summon him again and we were ready for him and we tackled him and murdered him I was playing with things that I had no idea what to do I don't even know if I if I can and now you're such a stronger like you're so much of a stronger sorcerer yeah keep in mind that there are even people in in in this plane of existence that we still haven't felt strong enough to take on I don't know summoning a demon and trying to talk [Music] we have action I also give me a brand back the last time I summoned him he appeared and dragged one of my friends to hell I'm now standing with you two and the last thing I want yeah I appreciate that I'm the one who will gamble with your soul did you begin to tear down the effigy there is a horn sounding in the distance nearby and you can hear the clattering hoots and square it sounds like members of the silver Order are approaching supposed to know it's the isn't the flame keepers that are gonna come in ritual I'm gonna go check the door to see if I can see them coming if there's any sense I can see coming out into the cathedral square our group of hooded lanterns and the night captain is riding his Griffon it's trotting forward along with flame keeper Ophelia Reed and several other priests and Knights of the silver order many of them look very worse for the wear but they are coming forward towards the square and they're coming towards the square and making their way towards the Cathedral we still have to check out that back room but should we let them know that we've cleared out the front and they can like come in and hang out in this horrible horrible stench maybe they should wait outside I'll leave the door open and I'll come back with you guys and maybe we can just check it out on our own while they're coming in yeah they maybe want to start cleaning this area up I assume that the ritual is going to be taking place should I shoot the other green flare is that what I'm supposed to do once it's cleared out I mean we still gonna take a look at the back yeah let's check it out well before they get here let's check it out I think that's the best play Sebastian runs up the stairs and kind of pokes his head into the back end of the Cathedral this is the sanctuary dome there is a large marble plinth upon which is a massive basin the smell of oil hangs in the room in each of the out large alcoves that make up this chamber are several statues and tombs dedicated to the Fallen flame keepers and paladin's of the sacred fire that some of which have been buried up here in the various shrines the whole thing is littered with shrines and even though it has lost much of its glory a palpable light shines still in this room as the what little rays of Sun that come through the top of the dome illuminate this fantastic scene above this room is devoid of the gore and wreckage that the other chambers were it's as if the Noles did not we're too afraid to step in here for the several of the large caskets and sarcophagi that are in this room are open and swayed out by in front of them almost forming a line of battle locking into this room are several skeletons splayed out on the ground with weapons in hand but they are now laying inert on the floor or surrounding the basin was there maybe some magic that brought them back yeah maybe it's possible Gregor was trying to work on something and we interrupted it as I step into the room do I see any stairs or anything that could take us down there are two large warded doors on the opposite sides of this room warded doors yep they are the two doors look like they have not been opened in an age and they bear several large seals and rooms across them and Holy Scripture holding the shop and tight do I see anything on the doors that could indicate if the the beaded necklace could open them no they have large knockers on them and like that they could be pulled open and judging by what you know the internal structure these doors either lead to very small rooms or possibly stairs leading down below which one should we open first I don't know well like heavy doors I don't know how much my maid you can could do but oh we can try give it a go if you guys want to keep an eye out for the such coffee guests things I'll try to open the door oh okay just keep an eye out if like skeletons like I'm like delighted so forth consider me on alert all right I get my bow out ready ready to fire at some skeletons I'm gonna go up to the door and it's or is it a push or pull it's a pole ignoring the label I'm gonna give it a big just heave you pull it open the door on the left and as as the door opens up there is a dark stairway leading down to the underground below the Cathedral what about the other one should we open it go for it okay I'm gonna walk across the room um while I'm walking to I'm looking on the ground for any signs of like triggers or you looking at all around and seeing this skeletal skeletons that are displayed above them some of these skeletons are ancient looking they look like they have been preserved in in here very very carefully and you can see that written on the sarcophagi are actually the names of these people and several of them are former high flame keepers of the city still buried in in kind of their funeral robes which many which have disintegrated and fallen away but the the the bodies themselves the skeletons are still quite strong and well preserved and looking at the skeletons that are on the ground you can see that they were all like they've all been attacked like almost as if the body that was here that if perhaps it was moving at one point and something attacked it and broke it to pieces it looks very similar to like when you fought animated skeletons in the past what happens what remains of them after they're destroyed maybe this was like a defense mechanism against the nulls invading the cathedral it wouldn't surprise me especially since they haven't really nested back there yeah maybe it's like a auto defense system that the the skeletons came to life and tried to attack the Noles when they came in yeah but could only get so far that makes sense to me I mean I don't spend much time in here so I don't really know how that I'm gonna open the nether door go for it it's also a set of stairs leading down okay i turn on my drift globe and illuminate the stairs is it go down pretty far both sets of stairs go down about ten feet where you can see that they are they go into a crypt and already you can see that there are alcoves on the walls and niches with skulls set into the niches or urns and the buried of the various faithful that were here and each skull is engraved with the name of who they were and all of the the people here range from other acolytes of the faith to other faithful people that wish to be buried here and the staircase goes down you actually can actually see it as you look down on the stairs that even there are skulls set in the niches underneath each step and as it goes down to the do about it descends about 15 feet before on this side it opens up into a t-shaped hallway the cathain goes down into two other separate staircases maybe we should let the paladin's know that we're like um before we go down into the dark creepy crypt filled with skeletons mm-hmm we should let the paladin's know that we're here well they know we're here oh yeah I know but like we should be like hey guys maybe like we needed to clear out the whole Cathedral including the basement before they started the ritual right bleep so and we're looking for the bones of our Ghana or Vitruvian maybe we should just like go out saying guys what what what's our next move do you want us to go in the basement well let them come in the main floor and then we can go down in the basement yeah I also just want to throw out there I I hate Undead I don't like him no no no fan no demons how you feel about demons kinda like I'm getting like a mixed by yeah I have a mixed mixed feelings undead though they just freak me out yeah been haunting me my whole life yeah so Pluto you can kill them I'm actually yet undead is just frustrating for me because I've already killed it once and now I gotta kill it again and that gets a little annoying but I'll do it again it's just like it's like over time for murder sports you guys want to go talk to the peloton oh oh I'm gonna go give a check at the door and give a wave to see if they've realized you can see that it looks like as you step out into the square you can see that the night captain and Ophelia Reed and the Lord Commander are meeting by the Bacchus tree and as you step out from the doors of the grand Cathedral they turn to face you immediately and the night captain speaks he says Ludo are you all right aye well what happened in there we we were able to slay the the priests dark priestess that was working with the Lord of the feast we were able to discover the remains of flame keeper Hannah and Virgil there is a concoction being brewed by a demon who's giving out these recipes pretty much kind of like a just for free just anybody flame keeper Hannah Virgil they gave their lives for others and Ophelia read speaks up and she says we will take their remains and use them alongside the bones of our Ghana and the true vo and consecrate this place in new in their memory it definitely meets it yeah they will doing the prayer beads I hold up the prayer beads the priestess was wearing these flame keeper of Helia stretches in it maiya I kind of look over at the Lord Commander to like he nods I hand them over he said the Knowles was it a no it was yeah an old priestess or those girl he called her gray Cora grigora she was a flame keeper Gregor as in high flame keeper Gregor a golden brown Oh probably not know this name oh I know this might have been but she was an OL maybe she assumed her identity did we kill her no she was Gregor golden brow was the high flame keeper of Drakon hime she was an OL she was a doll she's not gonna be the high flame keeper anymore now she could have just assumed the position like found her body and took her her prayer beads and knew her name like how many knowles do you know that well we magic the night captain's visa but we have to consider the possibility that she was transformed into one of these things that could have the implications of that does that mean that all the Noles could have been towns folk does that mean that did we just know have you been killing people did we just murder our way through half of the town of tracking hive they weren't they weren't people I know it's just a little more upsetting than slaughtering Knowles just a little jarring she also brought back the shuva to help the Lord of the feast she wasn't good like she deserved to die it's just but how is that even know that that's impossible okay it can't be right it can't be I mean but it could be pious Gregor golden brow was a just and pure woman she was a beacon of light and warmth she wasn't she wasn't serving the light anymore unfortunately what about the recovered holy relics that she'd effaced that she had on her are they do you recognize these are these Lord Commander speaks up and says that's definitely in its that are those are the prayer beads of the high flame keeper of drokken hime that is one of the seals of the city the seals it's one of the badges yes the prayer beads yes I said that it has the same motif and pattern as the badges not click not click no no I thought you were just role-playing yeah no definitely didn't click no I I miss that oh well so but of course it is it's magic binds it to the will of a flame keeper only then we need to elect a new flame keeper I guess I thought Pluto yeah you know what I think I'm ready there's still a basement I you needed us to clear out all of this place before you guys started your your process right philia read speaks up well I I need the bones of our Ghana and of st. for true vo in order to reconcile the flames out it is yes yes it's in the back right I mean that's fine the basement looks fine there's nothing scary down may I ask a question have you been back there I went to the backyard we were back there but not to the base had the Knowles gone back there it's presently we believe so I mean there were skeletons they weren't moving but they might have been but the Knowles seen that it looked like maybe the skeleton scared them off because they didn't seem like they were conducting anything back there they may have gone back there initially did that trigger some sort of thing do all churches have just skeleton traps that seems intense we the light teaches us that it is our duty to be the custodians of this world till we are to be the light in this world and when the light that we tend in our chapels and our cathedrals is extinguished it is a grave curse indeed for the light sustains the souls of our most devout worshippers for a day could come that even the most devout need their earthly bodies once more to fight back the darkness that is why we keep their bodies in our cathedrals and temples and chapels but when the light is extinguished there is nothing to guide those souls to be the beacon by which they can be anchored and clarified in death to this world fifteen years could drive them mad so we have a bunch of mad souls potentially in the basement of this Cathedral and if they're restless spirits without the guidance of the Living without the light of the flame they have been denied the warmth and the grace of the sacred fire for years over a decade and they deserve peace and rest they have all thought so much already just blowing them up counts are you giving me permission to go down there and destroy the bodies that are up and moving if that's what we're talking about the night captain says I can't ask my soldiers to do it it is is AB horn that we would have to do this that's why you have us and it's you don't have to ask them we do the things that other people don't know stay out of it that need to be done I don't like what skeletons up and walking around it's not my favorite thing but that makes it easier to if you guys secure the top floor we'll take care of the base no philia reid says they will be mad they will have been driven insane denied the light for so long they will not know and they will be without mercy and so will we can we show them the light is there any salvation any chance for redemption only through the flame hopefully if we reignite the flame we can gobble rest again then should you reenact the flame before we go down there or we need to but we need the bones to reignite we have to move quickly we have to get down there get the bones would it be a preference
