Dragon hime or rather someplace far away but also very close to dragon hime 4 when last we left our heroes they had ventured into a strange otherworldly and shadowy realm through a mirror that they had found in the Old Crow housed in amber wood village they have now been exploring this strange realm once the sanctum of Sebastian crows mother the Archmage Lenna 'the Eventide who Sebastian is still learning more and more about as our crew have encountered both a inert clone of Lenna and her former simulacra which they destroyed taking advantage of the fact that simulacrum cannot regain spell slots because otherwise those spells would have been pretty nasty after having secured the sanctum our heroes ventured deeper into the shadowy realm finding a strange room which had a shrine to some sort of demon this obese goat-headed figure with cloven hooves and bat-like wings that parlayed with our heroes for a time challenging them to take on directly the hound which has haunted Sebastian's dreams narrowly managing to defeat the hound and the shadowy creatures which came forth from that realm our heroes thus negotiated with the creature for an answer to a single question a question that has seems to have left more questions than actual answers yeah thanks but so be it when you deal with demons be careful what you bargained for because you might get what you asked for and need more in return still still with their strength sapped and some very Grievous wounds on Sebastian you are still within this cold and shadowy realm with this ancient looking demonic statue leering over you the cracked wind howling the cracks in the wall causing the wind from the planar realm beyond a howl throughout the room in the room are the doors that you use to enter enter but also another portcullis as a gate like portcullis that leads to a set of stairs that lead upwards as well the floor beneath you is cracked and filled with a shadowy I Corps and the dust like remnants of the shadowy creatures that you'd defeated earlier what will you do it's the demon still still hanging out the eyes still glow in front of you and in its hand it still bears that softly glowing aura polished delirium it's also really bright because of the daylight right that is corrected it the room is very bright because you did activate the drift globe to caused a light to shine through the whole room so the first day that we've seen in a while bringing the sunshine I'm still nervous about taking delirium from a demon but everything's in the statute it's like the energy for a baby's delirium from a baby oh well more anyway he can't even he's tight he's tied up basically yeah he didn't summon a demon hound and shadows that almost killed us the last time that we messed with him probably no you did it and he just tricked you into doing it demon have another question for here you may ask as many questions as you like I will answer any that you can pay the price for so here's the thing we haven't negotiated what the price is I don't understand what I would be offering in exchange for knowledge so I'm willing to bargain with you but I have a few stipulations I'm listening I don't want to forfeit my soul or the souls of my comrades nor do I want to go out and murder innocent people in your name that's not something that I'm okay with doing but what I'm wondering is you're where you are and we're here well right now we're here in this weird shadow realm but we have access to the Material Plane perhaps there's something you need or something that we can obtain for you as long as it doesn't break my personal code we might be able to negotiate a deal we're the only people who have come in here in a very long time maybe so you don't have many people to deal with unless of course you have a lot of other statues but anyway it might be beneficial for both of us to come to an agreement that works within both of our limitations or we'll just smash you the statue rests silent for a moment and you make an interesting offer but if you want answers I'm going to need collateral until I receive payment in full or you'll have to wait to get those answers until you can render me what I asked so what is it that you require in exchange for answers first a promise a pact from each and every one of you for assurance that I will get what I demand mmm see already your agreement you're losing me how do we agree to something if we don't know what it is what if I say yes and then you say okay you all have to die and I'm gonna steal your souls that doesn't really work for me that doesn't really work for me rather there are many things that I would like specific things you are near the cursed City are you not that's correct is he talking about amberwood village your dragon time village not a city Hey I think we need to Hamlet and they just named it number word village as long as it doesn't require me to forfeit the soul of my self my friends or anybody that I deemed to be innocent I do have a knack for killing people that are evil so that that is within my limits do your companions have these kind of scruples and limitations I am a little more open no no Pluto I mean I sometimes get killed people die around me like is that like are you like all do you want just like a random soul like do you want just like a we could we could find you a soul like do you want just are you are you I have no interest in the souls of weak-willed fools who will already end up in my domain anyways rules out you know all the thieves yeah all souls for knowledge that was the name of my debut oh oh I desire much more delectable fare than that specifics cuz I do have a little bit more moral judgment to protect the people attract me we know this one called River and we know another one called Ulrich and we know another one welling in the city Oh Oscar Oscar know we need him though can you have him after yeah when we're all used up when he's all used up and not worthy of our just jumping to trading Oscar soul but he might be a bit is that who you're talking about a black soul necromancer would be a tasty treat indeed I'm sure there's more than a few hiding in the city yeah we can shed hair waiting for their comeuppance so you have a taste for necromancer's it doesn't have to be Oscar there's gotta be more necromancer's another mage there's got to be more tasty so if I bring you necromancer Souls I can exchange those for questions that the only time I saw you'll take them someone you won't bring me what I really desire though will you what is that I've heard come in to dragonhide currently I've no allegiance we have a little bit of a but once again I have to determine whether or not I okay okay well put that one as a sidebar I need to talk to the pally if you won't bring me their souls then maybe you would bring I mean if probably gonna die a valiant and more tragic the death the better okay so let me just we know on this handy notepad we know of a corpse guy we have a merps guy we could go to the the machine I do not want to go near that maybe unless he comes non-sufficient and take all of them no not the wish people we ate one of them okay mister several great collection names deep within the city of Drakon Heim is the great Cathedral of Saint vut Rubio okay they're the legendary Saint is buried bring me his thigh bow this I will answer for you three questions three whole questions for that guy's bone yeah sure what's the worst thing has a great rave robbing we're not great were we're making business arrangement grave robbing it's called trading desecrating a a burial ground at a cathedral like it's one thing killing Oscar like this is alive enduring its favor big addition no if you will enter into compact with me mm-hmm I want to keep this more of a freelancers yeah not a patient demon and there is an extra price that you will pay me for every minute it takes you to complete this task in exchange upon your death I will have your soul are we gonna like party or like hang out have a nice talk we will have a nice talk and I will extract from your soul questions that I need answers to hmm is that just him just Sebastian or all of us I probably don't have any answers that you need to be honest you might be surprised little cat I mean that's when I die that's that's that's a problem for future Sebastian now Sebastian needs answers and now that I bone wants to know what his life means who cares about my dad can I just but but if we're all getting this if we're gonna grave rob a thigh bone for me can I get one of the questions I think we should all get one question yeah okay three question my soul up for any questions guys I have some question I also don't know what time looks like in the death world so one minute could be like 10 million years yeah she's totally right it's time work the same way evil demon was you that after your time with me has passed your soul will go forth to whatever end with no memory all the [ __ ] that doesn't sound that bad we get an eternity of wherever we end up without having to remember at all the torture it sounds great okay can you read between the lines when it comes to demon IG even down to because how long I'm more of a now person you know and right now I want answers to questions we have to make this deal right now we have to make this deal right now demon can I think about it cuz you know it is my soul eternal soul this is a limited time what's the limited time you go back oh so like leave the place or leave this room okay that's just look at all no he's not easy penetrating our minds still the statues voice resounds from the statue and echoes in your mind yeah I can't be good I don't think the huddle helps but it's it's more for just the the feeling of being in the huddle I like the huddle apart I feel safe so I've read a lot of books on demons the it's always a trap everything is a trap yeah you I hope I hope Sebastian you understand the gravity of the weight of the questions he's definitely always getting the better the better deal so whatever deal you're gonna make with this thing be prepared for the consequences they're comin what do you guys think because I I'm having a hard time making a decision here on whether we go for this or not since you guys are now pulled into this I will take your wishes to be honest if we walk away he's getting no souls and no bone so and we just get no answers to questions and just keep living our lives and this killing killing knowles and slant rolls knowing the afterlife isn't gonna end up in whose hands we could also just steal the orb and run not on the do he controls the doors we already know that I still want to know why the orb is here yeah but I feel like it's one of my my soul in his hands four minutes probably a lot of minutes it's gonna take us like days two days in his hands worth a little bit tuna now we're a little bit of time what if to leave and we come back with something that he does want if we find that thing right we just go get the bone in the deal yeah with it we I'm much more for taunting a demon than making a deal with a demon I could just give it to him anyways maybe he'll answer a question instead of three yeah and maybe we have more leverage if we actually had something he wants we had we could maybe barter we're right now we're kind of like at least if we brought something that we think a demon was not really the commitment type yeah this is fair i I mean I really liked his deal until he said that he would torture us for days and days yeah yeah yeah every minute he took and I never thought that the minutes turned into yawns or some could it could we don't know we don't know what he says a minute is a minute in our time and space yeah he's like one demon minute and you like do the math and it's like seventy thousand years yeah you're like come on man he's like also be cool shadow that attacks people in that time I could be a minion shadow I wouldn't mind that but I probably wouldn't I probably have more shadows there and we could find out if maybe there's other people that come here I'm voting no to this deal no dice demon I'm sorry your stakes are too high we cannot commit to this deal my soul is worth a lot so be it let's go get that bone we're still gonna get about maybe well another demon roll I don't think I I think desecrating the Cathedral oh my stomach starts to you know you were a religious man yeah I well I've studied angels and demons my whole life and if there's one thing I don't want to upset it's the balance of things that like this I've also studied angels and demons and I found that they're both full of crap so well I haven't studied either so I have no moral qualms and by studying I mean I read a picture book once the pop up the gem guide they had one in the mages guild it was really nice it was my favorite book for ages 3 and up that's something blew a hole in this room right there's another stairway yes there's another stairway on the same side of the room as the demon statue there's a portcullis before it that can be opened like a gate the stairs leading upward tossed on the opposite side of the room directly opposite the statue of this demon is a are the remnants of the base of a bailer and the blown out wall that leads into the shadowy abyss beyond looking squinting your eyes a little bit you can see the mighty bits of debris floating in the darkness beyond outside possibly the revenants of the other statue that was here wait another statue like on the other side of the room yes as I said at the in front of the crack in the wall the breach basically there is the remnants of the base of another statute and there are broken bits of masonry and statue that all fly out into the shadowy of this beyond is it like hang in the air or hanging this suspended in space so don't you know you're really good at masonry can you tell when the rock was broken yes alright I'm going to adjust my glasses I do one of the librarian let me get a look at this and I'm gonna look at this thanks I know you're really good with rocks I collect rocks this one's from every bird village and this one's from the farm and this one's from the mill every Rock yeah so do you want to investigate the rock yeah that's in the base of the statue and okay does it look like the same statue what's it was it holding things give me an investigation check I'm not good at that 11:00 examining around the base of the statue you find a piece of the statue that looks to be parts of a human-like finger and the demon is a demon finger its hands are ape-like but this finger that you you find looks like it was part of a hand that might have been raised up the kind the fingers are fully extended on it and looking at it the finger itself has an elongated nail and is very slender to match anything in the murals on the wall yeah the murals on the wall depict elven like figures and shadowy ghosts on this side of the room but on the other side of the room they depict zombies blubbering undead and shambling demons this is the the god opposite that represents that side we should do some research and see if we can find anything where we can balance the universe and I pull out my sword let's balance this room the Feng Shui is all off this got north-facing holes we still made huge that demon though me I just don't like demons yeah but I think if we can find a library somewhere in Jackie mind that may still have some books intact you said you knew a lot about you know demons and angels maybe can find out if there's an alternative god that may need some help on our way out of here should we grab the Delirium or don't Timmy I have a lot of questions about that too leer oh I know it's a bad idea but I really want more fish I'm not talking about selling that or what really I have a lot of questions involving that or don't we have this place was built for dragon hime fell yeah so why is there an orb of delirium who will answer those questions though Eldrick I don't need the or room to answer the questions do it you might be able to examine it and give us an idea on how old it is or we know it's made of delirium right can we say comfort like do we know it's made or is it purple it is the same color and consistency as the delirium that you've seen before however it is polished stone it looks like it may be covered in glass kind of encased how big is it it is roughly four inches in diameter and perfectly spherical does the demon hand look like it normally holds an orb yes it is clutching it and is the demon hand like could the could it be removed or is it like set in place like is it it is not set in place but the demons hands do perfectly contour around it yeah is that because I'm just trying to figure out if it was like did someone just put a delirium orb in this demons hand or was this demon hand built with a delirium organ mind these are the questions also I think if we blew it up and we would have both the demon orb and the Feng Shui is feng shui really important for caspia yeah it bothers me that you don't even think about you know your alignments and your a your thought your your balances and your this is your house like I'm just trying to help you I'm trying to Marie Kondo your house right now there's this statue does not spark joy how do you feel like how do you feel about this room nervous I say that we explore the way that other staircase and on our way out we do or do not take the orb but we can always come back and grab it one of us goes then you grab it you don't you you fly out the door this seems understand understood mage handed from outside the room yeah I just want the door to close limits that's why we'll be outside the room yeah but first was so much magic you control so I'm nervous about it uh I think yeah let's go up those stairs and you also have that library that we I'd love to check out oh maybe there's more information there okay let's go let's go up the stairs let's go up the stairs my demon opening the great you head up the stairs and they loop around again just as every stairwell in this sanctum does going up 30 feet to a landing and then turning back around over 30 feet and it opens up again once again once again into another cube-like chamber this is exhausting cubes however this one is very different from the others in the way that it is outfitted for like the prior library room this one is lined floor-to-ceiling with bookcases and bookshelves and the staircase extends up into the room where the staircase is made of glass as it goes into the room and extends up onto a glass platform because the floor is also bookshelves and there is a glass platform in the exact center part that the staircase leads to of the room that is a hemisphere of glass upon which is a circular bed outfitted with pillows almost set up as if it's a perfect spot to meditate and before this bed is a simple chest with some drawers and a lectern made of silvery metal upon which our two sconces with candles on either side that are just glowing blue lights and on the lectern is a large beautiful wooden bound you should go check it out I approach the tone so as you walk up onto these the glass stairs towards the platform you feel a sense that gravity could almost go in any directions if this whole room could rotate around to access any of the various shelves and library shelves within it and in the central part as you come up on the glass platform the bedding with the pillows is almost in the center it is a circular set of bedding not the type of bed that a human would necessarily sleep on because there's no blanket there's just soft pillows to sit on and that's all the platform itself when you step into it there's a feeling of warmth and comfort here as if something about this inner part of the chamber is preserved and others are not else don't sleep they met it to you so this is possibly where my mother would come to meditate or read it's a reading room is it wet it is not honest there is a singular chest of drawers which appears to have been made from this flowing wood the chest and the way that it is constructed does not look like the chest was carved so much has grown to fit that shape and there's the silvered lectern with the book with the large hole on it the book itself is roughly one foot tall maybe about three or four inches thick and about 10 inches wide and the covers of it are made of a very thick wood and leather and all of the pages are glossy white on the side you can see there are little silvery inside them and there is a soft latch of rope that is binding it shut and you can see that there is just a set a circle of rooms that has been set into the middle of the cover there's one thing I've learned it's that if you find a weird book and a creepy to mention you should probably open it and read it and yeah and not even think about the words that you're saying just read them out loud even as things change around you mm-hmm nothing bad has ever come from that can you address the room hello room yeah they command it like you own it vamp Ludo where the two of you going I'm still by the door yeah it's same the entranceway yeah okay I'm up on the platform in front of the book yeah you should like like this is your dimension now this is your mom ran the show like tell the room what you want yeah room rotate left nothing it was voice a feeling once more with little umph oh I'd like that book over there room your words echo throughout the chamber ineffectively awesome thank you Pluto hey no problem you're my Herald can you read those anything read the title you open it is there a title on the book or anything where there are rooms marked in in out arcane speech in arcane language do I know our you can make a Arcana check come on skull-splitter that is a 19 looking over the runes these appear to be a Wizards personal rooms and it's a little hard to figure it out at first but this would identify it as the personal room of a wizard named length Eventide like I'm buying the book okay and I open it it's a spell book I don't know how to learn from this rabbit we could sell it to the demon for answers I feel like this is important and I don't know what to do with it and I also don't know if I want to show it to the mages guild from the entrance I just kind of put it in your bag of holding what if it's safer what's it called what's the book it's my mom's book it's kind of like her diary of spells don't read your mom's diary yeah that's it your nose out of there private unless it's why she's wet then read it read the whole thing do I do I recognize any of the spells listed it would take you some time to fully decipher all the spells that are in this book but it appears to contain dozens of them and a if you want to spend at least an hour per using it I could start listing off some of the spells that are inside it I'm just gonna pick it up and put it in my bag of holding okay maybe pick it up and just hold it there for a second just hold it there for a second and see if anything moves tell the room that you're taking it I hold it back up room I'm taking this book okay are you happy Cluedo I like that you're treating the room with respect good I'm glad you're happy this gives this sparks joy for me in the bag of holding I'm gonna check the chest can I open the drawers on it yeah it opens up and inside are several sets of leather clothing and purple robes that we you would expect someone that was a member of the amethyst Academy to wear alongside a signet ring that is marked with the sigil of the dragon hime mage tower within Lennon's personal sigil okay I'm gonna take the ring I'm just gonna put that in my pocket for now I have a dragon high bring I don't know this is do I want but you have look at all the extra spots you have four rings we're gonna get you one for every finger and signet ring they're not small it's gonna make me hard to do wand stuff after this you have so many rings put the ring on a little bit of magic is in this ring again you would need time to examine it and determine the nature of the magic in here but it feels like there might be a spell of some time some kind lingering on this ring very good room I am leaving now thank you for your time ow I'm gonna just do a cast proper your bad we all bow and back up a deep well I don't know but that was how you just talked to rooms that have like weird like I don't know Pluto's in my head now and I'm nervous about mistreating this room so I don't bow to rooms as someone that knows a bunch of spells this is how I've always interacted with rooms of magic I think we should go now I think we have one one more room we haven't explored really do it we've explored everywhere else I think I think this is the last room all right oh wait that's a ring of your mom right yep did we see you put it on yep go tell the demon that you're the master now you got your ain't your mom's ring I'll think your mom was ever the master yeah no I I don't know I don't I don't I don't know go like show it off be like look what I flaunt it flaunt it to him speaks up like it I'm I'm you're so far your advice has gotten me nowhere talking so I guess we're still even yeah like it nothing bad has happened because of your advice go tell the demon that you're like in charge all right I will let's go have a nap I I go back to the demon's room and I'm like I have a ring the demon does not respond ok Pluto I'm leaving I'm going now I say we head back to your house I think we're done here for now as as we're leaving the demon room should I take anything let's go stand in the doorway I don't want to be dead by this deep should we just leave hmm I'm gonna stay on the doorway and stare longingly at at the orb from the doorway how far is it from the doorway to the orb the doorway that we first came into not the one that to get back although all the way to the to the front I mean the the other thing that I'll just thank you all is that you still have your strengths Korres drink yeah and and because of that pollute Oh in your specific case yeah your speed is reduced oh yeah I'm heavy so if you're thinking about how long it would take for you to run it's gonna be a lot slower given your current state so as you're remembering this there's a mage hand just floating towards the orb and you know what on second thought I'm feeling kind of weak yeah you would I'm always weak mage hand floats back I got touched by a shadow okay now I even touched by a demon the new hit TV series [Laughter] you guys want to leave I think we should go see Papa carrot-top and get some food yeah I'm about like I'm about done with this place for me I I've spent too long in weird shadowy dimension for my own liking okay right head back to the mirror mirror oh yeah oh yeah I didn't have my glasses so now I'm getting my amulet got my robe okay so you're taking things from the statue back okay um you head back through the cold and shadowy hallways back towards the mirror and step through who goes first me that's probably okay so I'm just a bit dragon behind like I'm not hurt but I'm feeling like a bit dream just some reason I felt like I was leading the way I'm sledging so yeah for a bit sludgy so it does are we doing sebastian pluto veil the fact that he asks the question makes me nervous about this but yeah i thought who do we honestly think was I think I was going out first okay or we could all hold hands together we jump we hold hands and jump through Sebastian you step through the portal and feel the coldness lurch over you as you fall back into the real world it's nighttime Vail and Pluto join you shortly there afterwards and you are in your parents old bedroom in your old creepy house back in Everwood Village it's probably around perhaps by that by the feel of it just after sunset I really don't want to be in this house very long at night let's put the sheet back on the mirror and go yeah agreed yeah I'm okay with getting out of here clunk clunk clunk clunk if you turn around you can see that the mirror is casting Apetit the there's no you have any light source with you in this room right now that you brought with you and the only thing I could think of is the driftwood okay the the mirror is resonating with this shadowy energy that it wasn't before and you can see on the ground around it this shadowy seepage leaking out from the edges of the mirror where the mirrors held into the frame and it's pooling out along the floor and dripping through the floorboards down below do we I think we need to call a repair guy I point at it and I say seepage shadowy seepage no I don't know how to deal with with that I throw the book back through the mirror just dive out the window um there you look out the window and you can see in the yard around the house are at least a dozen emaciated humanoid shapes walking towards the doors of the house we have a problem should I have left the book did I upset the room no occurrence uh lots of deadly walking shapes that I am NOT happy about coming towards the front door of the book back in Pluto did removing the book break the Feng Shui of the room okay if I could your custody of knowledge if I consult my guide yeah because it was a room with many books and it had lots of light it felt peaceful I don't know just throw the book back if I I toss the book back into the mirror okay you throw the book at the mirror and it collides with the front of the mirror with a clang and lands on the ground in the iCore oh yeah we put a baby my core is kind of like slipping off it and it is on and it kind of like falls over your hands and it's this cold and shadowy thing not unlike the shadows that were conjured earlier in the realm and you sleep it off all over the course probably this mirror causing us to be so scary Pluto I gotta stop I gotta stop listening to you you know what I get that I understand I I'm really stepping outside my zone of knowledge right now we're in a magical dimension and I'm taking pointers from the one guy who can't cast a spell why just cause he can guess what spell doesn't mean I don't know about books I don't know about books you're right totally right I don't even know why I enjoyed to question you on that carry the book back through with your glasses or your robe or whatever should I go through the mirror I try to put my hand back through the mirror you're wearing the road from before yeah yes you can I step into the shadowy dimension I set the book down okay and I step back out okay any change I look out the window the creatures the humanoid figures are moving towards the front door about half a dozen of them to the front door and another half a dozen of them towards the back they're still there well Ben might as well turn in tomorrow and I step back in I pick up the book put it back in my bag step back out I'm like well it's not the book it's not but did we go at the window do we I mean I can climb up to the roof can you wait a second I my hardest I might have a spell imagine that I'm gonna have my javelin ready oh wait I can only take one person I was just gonna say I could I could just thunder step us 300 feet outside the house I mean you can do it I can run I also have that cape one of the doors gives away with a crack let's get and you can see coming from the windows below there's a bright light shining out from the cracks and the windows of the floor below you and you can just hear this creaking footsteps and these low gasping cries as these booted emaciated footsteps begin walking into the building turn necromancer we can take back the soul I have a plan run away hello who goes there diplomacy ah your your breaking and entering this is my home please leave nailed it what if it's kids are you children are you yelling this oh yeah okay I have done so I'm ready to climb out the window there is no response time to go out the window the door to the room that we're in is it currently open or closed it's kind of hanging ajar you would have left it open when you came in I'm gonna run to the door and close it okay and then barricade it yeah okay as you run up the door you can see that there are footsteps coming in and up the stairs and as you go to pull the door closed you just catch a glimpse through the little bit of light that's shining around through my glasses that there is a an ambulatory skeletal figure coming up the stairs bearing a rusty weapon and bits of skin and flesh rotting off of its bones as its lurching forward towards the door itself can we move that bookcase in front of the door yep I wanted like I mean I don't have much strength right now so probably grabbing push I mean I'm not as strong as I could be but I'm okay sure okay you're gonna move the bookshelf in front of the the cool make a strength check can I help him yes make his strength check and if you succeed you can get grant you can grant the help action to him 18 18 he doesn't need it so strong toppled down I'll help ya I'm kind of pushing it over as you push it down you see that there is a light coming up the fireplace because the fireplace in this room is connected to the same chimney as the fireplace on the ground level and there is a light rising up the fireplace I start pushing one of the beds towards the fireplace okay roll for initiative do we still leave the window Oh what's your initiative oh the Attic oh yeah further I'm definitely gonna climb up there alright and where you're still by the oh by the way that cape cuz she used it I don't think it's recharged yet that's I don't have the you know the dimension to her cape that I got your mom's old robe okay I don't think it works yet why not have you tried I guess I could give it a give it a whirl okay give it the old and just leave us here by the most polarizing initiative ever I get a one for the skeletons and a 20 for the other creature the other creature uh-oh yeah do you have the fireplace under control I don't know I'm pushing a bed does that mean that I have the fireplace under control I don't think so okay this is recheck what are you doing pushing a bed dear yes no no no now that we've rolled initiative I'm wondering if there's better ways to spend my turn you're just making the bed your pants again your fingers rating it's gone it's gotten into you okay what do we got pernicious 18:18 prevail nine three well you beat the skeletons you're not wrong I wonder what kind of what if we trick the demon into thinking these bones give them these bones okay Sebastian as you turn to push the bed towards the fireplace licking flames begin curling their way up through the fireplace and from the chimney below as they do so a they are followed by a floating skull with and as the skull comes up you can see the flames turn a bright green with points of orange light coming from its eyes and the flames almost form as it comes up this ghostly body that looks like the body of a emaciated alpha woman and the the skull flies up into the the chimney and leaps and licks forward into the end of the room as it does so the green flames illuminate the entire room the skullet sell a whole array of dancing fire that forms into this burning Corona of hair that looks like it's coming off of it with this trailing in substantial body of flame but there's the solid skull that's floating there in place it lets out a keening cry that's just this ghostly noise coming out from its mouth I'm just kind of like this sort of noise and as it does so it casts fireball uh-oh hey that's filming there is a low roar of licking flame that blossoms out from the center of the room and an explosion rocks through the entire upper level you can all make the Xterra tea saving throws how we have we leveled up yet or it's like I told you guys you had to take a short rest at least before you can apply your levels or technically I don't tell my new spells you do not know I hope you should have napped it them at them I'm should have had a nap with the demon well this is sure what occurred is but you know we'll focus on the enemy in front of us Oh baby at 21 I mean if you want to take a short restaurant battle I might keep taking a short rest in the middle of battle to start with just lay down in the bed just just have a nap okay what do we got 22 22 21 21 1010 so everyone succeeds except Sebastian as this explosion of flame rocks through the room throw me a fistful of days yeah ice in the face I got fire in the face I'm not having a good night yes the fire came after the ice that's true now my whiskers are sinister that's also true satisfying sound is this the first fireball of the campaign and you're very dramatic with your placement of the it's also a really disappointing fireball good I might live maybe oh that's a really sad fireball 26 points of fire damn oh my god I'm gonna use 13 points on a successful saving through I'm gonna use my reaction of my shield to absorb it alrighty Dorrie I got this don't worry I'm worried as the fireball erupts it ignites the bed in the bookshelves some twirly fire whoops [Laughter] or two on yeah all the furniture in the room and the floor is lit on fire I'm glad we sealed the door as a roiling Inferno begins taking over the Crowe house my house do you have a good insurance policy we were protected against the demon flood and an ice and like a cone of cold but fire we didn't get fired we didn't think fire was gonna and that is that moves us to veo stern I'd like to say that the energy I my turn use my feline agility cuz I want to move as possible and I cast though rope trick and I say up we go guys and I climb up the rope into my little dimension wow what a cool move yes and I poked my head I say follow me that's it okay climb up into the rope trick smart plan Sebastian what are you gonna do after this fireball goes off and I am also on fire I I roll my way over to the rope trick and climb climb up it as well okay you climb up the rope yeah good on you you're in the in the rope trick now that's my movement can I like pop I wouldn't cast a spell actually you can't attack from within the rope trick you know what I'm gonna do in the rope trick drink a potion okay that's smart yeah my one hit point says so cool and pollute Oh what are you gonna do well not one for following the leader I'm gonna run how big is the mirror the the mirror itself is about six feet tall about 18 inches in diameter and then there's the frame around it probably weighs about 100 pounds the mirror dies in the fire so I didn't go into the mirror but I want to save the mirror true can I carry the mirror can you pick the mirror up yes can you pick the mirror up and carry it with your strength score reduced as well as keeping all your armor gear and equipment full but you're carrying capacities being introduced to believe a hundred twenty pounds total so are you strong enough to wear your armor climb up the rope and carry the mirror with you yeah that that doesn't add up to me I think you need to to with your strength drained I don't think you're capable of doing I try to grab the mirror and I realized that it's like like I just had a big workout okay and I just okay you climb the rope into the rope trick interesting play group okay nice job Vail and I'm just gonna send the rope trick I'm just gonna sit down and just kind of like watch through the the hole as is your house burns down and we pull up the rope by the way yeah oh yeah and I'll post profile for me okay you pull up the rope ass for you the skeletal creatures continue to bash at the at the door and we're right on to the next round so the they continued a batch of the doors and move forward into the space the flame the flame spirit its continues to scream about and you see that it flies forward and starts lapping up almost like it's trying to drink in or breathe in the shadowy energy that is coming out of the mirror it basically heads it falls to the ground almost around the shadowy fires the the shadow and begins breathing it in and the and the shadow actually fills its nostrils and it as it does so the magic sort of nourishes the creature almost like it's feeding upon the shadowy energy is coming out of the mirror what do we do guys are we staying up here and told my whole house burns down or are we dealing with things well I mean we like I can kind of swing down and shoot things if you guys both my feet but the most part I have to go out to shoot we have this for an hour so I don't know if we want to let your house burned down for an hour could we dump some water and what do we have in our I don't think we have that much water yeah I pour like my okay canteen of water it did nothing can't can you like doubts flames with magic do you have like the opposite like does your can trips like I have an idea to save the mirror yeah oh I have another well I mean we could rest and level up and then go back into the battle I don't know we just just take a nap it seems weird with the situation yeah yeah I would feel bad about your house at the same time I mean it's burning down like I'm you know I don't have them I mean I just needed to heal up but I maybe we can I mean it's it's here if we need it as long as I keep finding concentration so it's just here for an hour so is the flame spirit like right underneath the rope trick yes yeah it is hold the feet I can do that though I can kind of like swing down out of it you have to end if you want to do this yeah you'll have to end your turn outside the rope trick no popping back up and down inside the right back the only allowed that once yes because the spell says you can't attack from inside the rope trick yeah and I'm gonna interpret that as saying there's no way to its spells not intended to be like a firing platform yeah I think can we move the rope trick I don't I mean it's at least a way for us to get a little bit heals and then go back in at least if you want to use it that way so I mean I'm gonna take a maybe a greater healing potion okay okay Sebastian what are you gonna do isn't it just a flat 20 yeah how much is a regular healing potion so heal up and then let's get the jump on it yeah because if it's sitting there lapping up like a like a flame dog does it know where we went it does know that you disappeared up an invisible hole in a rope but you're gone now and it doesn't seem to care we could also just wait it out and see if they leave my house is on fire yeah nobody want to stop the fire I mean it's a dilapidated old house anyway but I mean we have the mirror here I don't know I just I feel like yeah Pluto it's your turn what are you gonna do I did I did I guess I don't know I didn't say what I was doing I guess I'm healing okay healed you thinking I'll drink a healing potion okay the skeletal creatures continue to move into the building [Music] do skeletons like fire I don't think they care these ones are actually trying along the side of the building they're actually trying to climb up the side of the wall oh that's creepy yeah and are these guys in the room they those ones there are smashing at the door and the barricade and you hear a splintering of burning and shattering would breach the room as with their hacking hacking with their weapons and their undead nature letting them just smash into it they burst through the door and begin hacking through the bookshelf which is burning and the weakening wood has allowed them to do so so it's part they've partially broken through whatever we're gonna do we got to do it I want to go down the fireplace oh okay top of the round the flame spirit continues to lap up the shadowy energy veil it's your turn so once I cast my next belt this is gonna go so huh I can't separate strike okay give us a heads up strike and the rope trick goes away we've dropped down and I say and just to make sure the fireplace is pretty big like this flame spirit could get up it on its own or no the the flame spirits body is inconsequential it is just a skull okay the only physical part of it is just a skull how how big is the fireplace good I could then have to look up to it to see up you're gonna have to look okay to figure out how wide that fireplace the how wide the chimney itself is alright fireplace is quite wide you could fit in the fireplace yeah but the chimney you're not certain okay I rush over to the fireplace Mies ever strike I don't get it don't actually does not end with when you cast another spell so if you want concentration so sorry then I hop down out of it okay sweet and then I emission okay I Scout because I want to take a look at the fireplace so flames the flame spirits screams as you jump out of nowhere and rush down and it begins lifting up in the air and turning to look at you you look down the fireplace and clamour inside there's a gym the chimney goes up and it goes down yep it's maybe about 18 inches wide probably not big enough for me so you could you could squeeze through at half speed down but you'll need to make an acrobatics check to avoid getting stuck I don't think I want to go that way then how many feet did I move across there's room is 40 feet so you moved about thirty including down the rope you've moved about forty feet so far okay so with my strike which gives me 60 I then use my feeling agility again because in the last turn I didn't move any feet so now I get double my speed that gives me another 30 feet I run for the window okay the the narrow windows at the back are about again about 18 inches wide you could try to squeeze through them and there and they permit recall the windows have all been boarded over so you'll need to break through them first to get get through them there's narrow spots where you're able to look outside and there is areas where these boards are breaking so if you have your action to kick through the window of some kind of breakout the rest of them it is easy to get through them these back windows as well all the windows have been like boarded over to some extent so it'll take an action to kind of clear them out so you can jump through them but yes I'll do it okay yeah which window do you want to go through the larger ones with an arrow the larger ones okay which one actually gonna make it through the narrow ones we're still by breaking it yes but you'll need to squeeze so there's a small chance you get stuck I'm gonna go for the smaller ones actually cuz they're right by me okay and then you still give me a strength check to break the window perfect 9 no matter negative 2 huh you punched the window try to push away through it and parts of the board's fall out yeah but if you're gonna squeeze through it in this case the checks gonna be harder and if you fail you are gonna take some damage because of the boards that you've now smashed partially our jagged and sharp all right then cuz it's that or I'm staying where I'm so I'm gonna go for it okay give me an acrobatics check going for it 25 okay you squeeze through and you can feel this nail rip into your side as you do so you do take six points of slashing damage but you are through and you are able to slide down and use your climb speed to land on the ground oh yeah okay called you where there's a few skeletons down there you can see in the in the other room so maybe coming up Sebastian what are you gonna do what do I need you to stay close to me on your turn okay alright that doesn't make sense I need you to stay close to me okay I a drop down okay and I kind of back up a bit and we're gonna kind of chill touch at the flame spirit okay is that an attack relevant one yeah okay 17 that is a hit I like I like your strat that's eight damage okay seems that drinking in the shadowy I Corps has given it some sort of resistance to necrotic damage but it is still harmed by it and it will have dissipated on its attack rolls wonderful yeah in any else Sebastian um no that's it okay Pluto you're up I jumped down okay and I'm gonna land right beside the flame thing okay and I'm going to stab it with my javelin all right go for it but I'm also going to use the old trip attack okay like I step to the side after Oh crit nice I needed that needed that baby so now I'm gonna trip attack it okay do I roll the the additional the dice for an uber yes yeah do get the extra damage from the maneuver unfortunately as an insubstantial creature this is creature is actually immune to the prone condition well then it didn't so I just like swipe through its legs and there's just no yeah eggs yeah your blade carries up and slammed into its skull and it is damaged but it isn't tripped over okay 11:17 plus three wait yeah seventeen plus twenty the vicious blow leaves the sends a fracture through the flame skull and through the Flaming Creatures skull and the flames flicker and sputter for a moment the creature is effectively bloodied Thank You skull sputters ice and I'm gonna attack it again okay 22 hit wow that is a hit and that's just a regular kakaka six damage not quite as impressive as last no and then I'm gonna push it away with my shield I'm gonna punch it in the skull nine it's a natural 20 it loves it it stays in yeah okay is this the show and then I'm gonna step back towards Sebastian okay sweet bottom around with the skeletons oh man the first skeleton punches through the wreckage and sends the flaming wreckage scattering everywhere clearing the way for the other skeletons to charge into the room at the two of you Oh perfect that's exactly what we wanted my bookcase did nothing as long as I stay alive they come at you with their broken and twisted blades making one attack against pollute oh and two against Sebastian meet I get a seven and then 11 against Sebastian's wonderful and a 21 versus blue you can have it I hide behind oh you take eight points of slashing damage as these skeletons come into the room and it stabs you in the side with a rusty blade ah but I stab one of the ones that attacked my good buddy okay 22 hit one sorry and I go stop stabbing my friend and I get 5 damage I'm so not strong Skelton takes five points damage cool javelin skeletons up here begin climbing up the walls and they try to smash through the windows okay so here's what you see as the these ones come up from behind you hear this clamoring up the walls and these skeletal limbs like punch through the board's across the video you can see these reaching grasping arms as they pull away the the broken Timbers and the skeletons begin pulling themselves into the room this is like from a movie every zombie movie yeah I'm not the mirror oh my gosh yeah so they have pulled themselves up I'm gonna say that they're all effectively prone those ones as they're pulling themselves into the room finally they'll beside you another skeleton punches out the window that's behind you and reaps reaches out through the window to grab through it through the window it's like pulling you clothes back into the end of the wall make a strength check to it gets it twelve so the skeleton reaches through the wall grabs you by the shoulder pulls you up against the broken window and you are grabbed by the skeleton and another one's hands reach forward towards you as well and this one also the basically two sets of skeletal hands are grabbing you and they're slamming your body up against the wall trying to use your body to break through the window and pull you into the room they're a little too handsy I would say we go back to the top of the round with the flame spirit and it turns its fiery gaze towards Sebastian and pollute oh and casts its fire raise one at each of you zap it gets an 18 hit Bluto and an 8 to hit against Sebastian I hide behind Pluto again I use my shield to just kind of absorb it cool it your AC's 19 yeah yeah plus I think plus one because of my cool shield okay it it hovers up into you know into the air and it flies it flies around on top of the wreckage of the bookshelf hey over here no the knocked over ones putting it between the other skeletons yep okay Vale you're up I want to try to break free of the scary okay a skeleton hands since your action to escape the grab yep okay roll it strength check to 14 so you are you remain grabbed you have your movement but your speed is currently 0 yeah why can you claw it I know that my action was to try to yeah do you have anything you can do here bonus action or other things under these circumstances okay Sebastian you're up sir so I glanced over my shoulder I can see out this hole in the wall yes yes you can but there is a curtain of flame in the way that's fine I can still see right yes I put my hand on Pluto's shoulder and I'm like you know what this party needs a little bit of thunder and I Thunder step nice thunder step what comes from after lightning cool I gotta make Constitution saving throws for a bunch of the way I I picture veil you know when like a cat when you see a cat like on a leash and they just they just they're they're just like like it's like they're trying to like just like yeah or a chai you put a t-shirt on a cat they just like there's a deafening pop that hits does the flame thing get hit ReactOS yeah nice you might be able to kill it yeah it failed and about half the scale well actually Alba - and skeletons failed because there's more in it so I'm gonna you know I'm not that's nineteen you as the thunderous energy pulls you out of the room the skeletons are disintegrated by the thunderclaps sending the bones flying up against the windows and walls and the flames skull is completely shattered and it breaks and falls to the ground as well and the thunderous energy sends a gush of like rushing wind and the flames just kind of like shoot out the windows as well in that way it's really really just that you know that image of like fire just exploding out all the windows of a building at the same time so everything on the second level just all of the barricades shatter and there's splinters of broken wood and glass that go flying out into the yards starting smaller fires which will put themselves out in time the flames still rage in the second level but man that was a lot of damage oxygen yep you know you definitely need a new interior decorator yeah for this your house yeah that's that's my turn they´ll is still stuck but it's now Pluto's turn we're here in the street and you can see and you can now hear around you there are bells ringing it's the town watch Belle because there's a the fire has been sighted and you can see what looks like a group of people are rushing up through the darkened streets ahead towards the fire where's Vale I don't know she left the Rope portal and then when we left she wasn't in the room anymore we gotta go get her where is she I don't know and I'm gonna run towards the house is there any skeletons on this side you can see that there the front door has been battered open and that through the I think you guys broke one of the windows on the first level as well and here too yeah and you can see that there are skeletons across the other room that are trying to that are reaching out so you can see the through the lower window their skeletons in the lower room that are doing something to something on the other side of the window okay I'm running towards that okay I'm going to use and I'm gonna yell Sebastian okay so yeah that's what you can see they're looking in the end of the room and Bao's on the other side of the window I'm gonna run towards the broken window okay see this one here yeah and how much is that in the movement that would be 30 feet of living at least yeah okay I need a dash to dive through can I see there now you can see in this room the skeletons have been smashing around things and you could see the licks of fire coming up through the rafters above the fire hasn't yet spread down to this level and you can see that there are two skeletons that are reaching through the window grabbing veio who has Godwin who do I just got us out of there good instincts hey you boney you boney losers pick on someone your own girth they seem very happy to oblige you on that one I've never movement if you want to move further in the room yeah I do okay put yourself in I stab one of these this one you need to spend your entire your action to - to get that far okay I'm doing that okay and I run right up to him yeah and I and I and I I I growl at him it's really out of care and I don't know why I did it these first the two skeleton the first skeleton that has a hold on you veo tries to pull you into make a strength check come on fourteen okay so that is a oh wait no I that's my strength I'm a negative - okay it's it's a tie so the three roll I'm sorry Sebastian 14 I got a 15 haha so the skeleton grabs you and it slams you through the window as hard as it possible pulling you through the broken the broken window you take two points of slashing damage and you land prone on floor in front of it and then the other skeleton takes its blade and stabs towards your stomach getting a 22 hit oh yeah uh-oh you take five points of slashing damage two of the other skeletons rushed towards pollute oh and the other the one that's closest to Vale rushes towards her so the those two yeah yeah rush to pollute oh the other one rushes towards Vale and the other one rushes towards me as well yes so that one was the one that attacked before another skeleton attacks Vale only getting a 9-2 hit and then three of the skeletons all attacked dude Oh getting a 12 a 22 and a critical hit I accept out of not really like a 5 damage from the first attack 13 damage from the current as the three skeletons leap forward almost with this renewed undead bigger as if the shadowy energies are giving them the limber and the semblance of life again and they leap forward almost as if the martial traditions that work in their life are coming back to them swirling around you and stabbing you with their blades the other just brutally rushes towards Vale and brings this blade down trying to stab you and you just roll out of the way and the blade just collides at the floor right beside the side of your head I'm gonna repost the one that missed me okay eat miss oh sorry nine-nine okay we go to the top of the round the flame spirit is destroyed but though it is your turn you are prone you are grabbed you are on the ground and you are being stabbed by a bunch of skeletons they're rusted weapons and ancient war gear rotting away in front of in front of you these are truly ancient dead that have risen out seeking new life to devour so my Zephyr strike is still active for my opportunity tax I didn't move on my last turn mm-hmm so I am going to feline agility okay that's cool but your speed is zero because your grab can I get up you can stand up yep but you're still grabbed by this guy okay listen so your speed is still zero okay and I am going to take I'm gonna take a swipe at the one that's grabbed me yeah with my only melee weapon this scimitar okay nice zero idea do get two attacks so I'm gonna take my and and that's a twenty six that hits nice my skull-splitter five damage it's something nothing take my second same guy yeah it's gonna hit ya 16 plus 7 are you talking the one that's grabbing the same yeah same one that's grabbing me stop save I've damaged as you as you pull your blade away you take the two attacks and your scimitar cuts both of its arms on it drops down destroy yeah they ain't scared a bunch of undead around anything else umm because I'm not grabbing my still movement zero your movement is now no longer zero but you stood up from prone so you do have to use hacker you do have to use half your speed to do that but you still the rest your speed to move if you want to so with that because I'm using my healing agility which doubles my speed I now get my regular speed and I hop by and I runs like a cornered cat that scratches you back unexpectedly say whoa thought you were declawed and as I'm running I'm like I don't think you're sorry okay I want to keep an eye on Poudre through the windows so as much as I can Sebastian you're up can I make it to the open window here yeah you can hi it's about should've come Vale I've run up and I look in the window and I just see Pluto alone surrounded by skeletons and I'm gonna cast first I'm like Pluto do you need help it looks like you need help and I stick my hand through the window and I just started firing beams of fire at them okay and I'm gonna cast what's it called scorching ray mm-hmm so I'm gonna target the one behind at first that is a 19 that hits five damage we're gonna fire again 21 yep I'm gonna use a sorcery point to re-roll that seven it's destroyed whoa blown apart by the fire evil it raised and my last one will go to the the next skeleton mm-hmm 18 that is a hit ooh well so the first two rays collide with it but the second array just slams right through the first one's body and blows apart the one right behind it almost like the three rays are landing at the same time and just bone fragments and bits of flame fly across the room leaving only the scattered and broken remains in the skeletons you got this Pluto cool thank you're up sir are we running i crit no I'm gonna tack the I stab it for 60 minutes that's a very impressed I don't have the plus three twice right you know you know the dice twice no you mate so you give a resounding blow against the side of its head and there's a crack that goes through the skeletons face but it's still remarkably standing and then I miss spectacularly and then I'm gonna smash consol you're supposed to hit them like all my armors just so much heavier I'm not used to swinging like this and it's just getting harder and then I'm gonna shove him with a big old four gets a 15 and then I just run away okay he takes the opportunity of that but only gets a 5 to hit and I'm gonna jump out the window right into me yeah as the skeletons begin to the skeletons claw their way forward in pursuit when you create a skeleton as a level 6 fighter and you don't kill it yeah ok reaching for you be a critical hit I'm 19 leave me alone no they hit the critical hit deals a total of 12 points of damage the regular hit only 5 points of damage as the two skeletons rush out the room to pursue you with your speed hat from the pro they're able to catch you and they lay into you with their sighting blows viciously stabbing at you the last one pursues Sebastian pursues pollute oh hi getting a 19-2 hit ow for five points of damage Wow as they move they are you can feel motes of shadow clinging to their bodies and beginning to collect around them and you can see this undead vigor being restored to them almost like they're moving with the Grace and vigor that they had in life again we're never having sleepovers at your house again yeah we're never I just want to pull a con tamper with them we go to the top of the round with Vale oh I'm running away I want to - ok so I can get sixty feet you really don't feel like fighting tonight no I guess these guys they're just skeletons but at this point I've been like grabbed and dead handled by these guys so I'm like nope nope nope nope not jiving nope so if you want to run me around and then I see you I'll be it was most honest plea I look at you and I'm like alright I guess I'm gonna take care of this then since the two of you seem to have issues of skeletons I'm really everything's really heavy after I've helped you face your demons remember that remember when I helped you fight your demons literally yes I'm actually I'm gonna back up a little bit the skeletons in base contact with Pluto not me and you and you yep okay well then I stay where I am pokum poke them with fire we're gonna try to chill touch him okay you do a disadvantage on the attacker oh yeah 18 that is a hit that's solid [Music] eight damaged send your hand forward right up against its face sending the chill energy from it basically like absorbing the chronic power and it crumbles down to dust see you guys that's how you do it just gotta touch him excellent Ludo you're different when they touch you do we go back for the mirror how can we see the fire brigade they are approaching closely they'll probably be here and around because if they come here and they start getting say I don't think they're ready to get stabbed by skeletons I mean they might be maybe that's part of their job description potentially especially if they've been around this house I feel like I have to be the the help in like you know I'm security for amberwood village right now is the fire people I don't feel like they're gonna be ready to fight skeletons especially the skeletons that are like renewed with shadow energy that we may or may not have tracked into I agree and that's why we're killing the skeletons so I'm gonna start from far away I'm gonna go towards the front door okay and I'm gonna start heading back up the stairs despite the flames there you double your movement to get towards the stairs yes okay so you dash forward you're in in that building take the top level there off as well just for now yeah holding comes off it's not a tree yeah cool so anyone in the in the main floor anymore there's no skeleton in there the the flames are starting to - you can hear these creaks and cracks or at the room as the fire began it continues to spread throughout the rest of the building it seems largely contained to the upper room right now but it but you can hear that kind of that creepiness of it's definitely getting into some of those structural and hmm okay okay we go to the bottom of the round you can hear more skeletons shuffling around moving around some of them come around the corners it's at this moment that the the mob of people arrived from the firebird great brigade and the you hear a resounding voice cry out all right crowd we've all gathered together but don't worry Jupiter Jones is here to put out the fire we'll show you what this good Caspian organization style of a fire brigade can do we're not gonna live this down are we let's just say that we arrived on scene first yeah we were just wait can you hear this because you're in the building yeah do I hear him he has a booming loud Li and you could already hear him barking orders like you to go towards the well draw as much water as you can no you don't look strong enough take two of my men with you and and then there's more running around and you can see oh and go get that blacksmith and his boy they were stout lads they'll be great at helping put out this fire that's you yeah Jupiter I'll put out the fire alone I can do it I'll put her with my shield and my hope I have both of those in great supply veo what do you do it's your turn I consider for a moment and I just say you know what I can't let Jupiter know that I wasn't strong enough to kill these skeletons so I actually you know so I actually go back did these skeletons like come around the corner there in the building proper oh they're in the building oh okay so I just looked through a window then and I take out my long bow and say finally then far enough away and I take my two shots with my long bow go crit there it is she's back yeah there it is you gotta get the bow no scimitar no strength jacks just give her the bow Oh God twenty-five shoot the skeleton right through the vertebrae that connected its head to its neck and it collapses into a pile of bones that's for touching my fur the other one second shot nice 18 that's a head yes eighteen damage you shatter it's a ribcage and sending flexible flying and scattering across the floor I'll just wipe my face and like that feels better Sebastian what are you gonna do are there any more skeletons about or decides there are but they might be on the second level I'm going to I guess we're gonna spend my action to dash in with Bluto okay Bluto do you need help yeah what are we doing I haven't really thought that far ahead just running into burning buildings and hoping for the best yeah I'm just a better firefighter than Jupiter that's all I know of course you are okay I hope you are because I want you I this is gonna be for the for the books I'm gonna run up the stairs okay you run up the stairs and there are four skeletons milling about at the top of the stairs trying to smash open more of the doorway that led in to the room within there and there is some fire that's spread out into the hallway as well Joe and I already put that back yeah just we can put it beside because we're using both levels right now yeah yeah put it back on we know that you're down there I get up there little snafu does I'm really not good at attacking right now are they preoccupied with the door they're moving into the room I'm gonna attack the closest one okay yeah and I stab it with my javelin getting a 11 okay jams right between its ribcage and you pull it back now and I and and then I hit it with a I pull it out and I try to go 17 hits yes for cuckoo 7 damage okay and then I'm gonna slam

the events are unfolding currently or are you because a shout has rung out through the darkness of the night as the voice of Jupiter Jones resounds around ember wood village barking orders and saying yes will form a bucket brigade you men get in a straight line from here all the way to the well you'll pass one bucket from one to the other and we'll have that water here in no time to put out this building and with reason with that you hear another voice above the the din of the crowd cry out Lord Jones with respect this place is kind of a dump why are we gonna put out the fire here I mean the people here say this building is just like a ruin now now LEM we need to prove ourselves to these good people that we are heroic heroes who are good at putting out fires and defeating monsters and there's no monsters in the town so we need to put out a fire to prove it to them there are monsters in the town there's monsters to run out and and you can hear the few other murmuring voices saying like yeah this place is like a scary haunted mansion are we should we just let it burn there's people with the buckets being like yeah I kind of agree no no you have to put out the fire of this building surely it's a it's prime real estate I want to buy it and there's kind of like this low murmur across the crowd of crickets for a moment snap to it men the fire is going to spread to other buildings and in the area and then people begin to to move around as well he's in the various nefarious reasons as you hear these voices crying out the skeletons in the building lunge toward you peluda how oh is it cuz I stabbed the one yeah how many of the mother up there four okay Pluto you're up it you could hear the rolling fires and the crackling flames and the lurching of the building as it it's poised perhaps on the brink of a collapse as this happens the skeletons lunge Tory towards you hungry for your life essence launching a barrage of it's I get a 13 15 a 20 and a 21 to hit the two hits the skeletons leap forwards clawing at you with their rusted weapons and you take ten points of damage ah de l'Europe I scream manly man lately I hear the scream more of a gentle roar not to scream it's a flood and I dash towards the front door towards Pluto and as I'm dashing I say don't worry Jupiter we got these monsters no need to worry and IRS - along the front yard towards the front door so you're at the very front of the building Pluto's on the second level fighting skeletons there yeah Minnie down and you see Sebastian there on the on the ground level you kind of just skirt across the front way and a very making eye contact with a very shocked looking Jupiter Jones I you there cat quickly get behind me to safety it's not safe for you to run into that burning building well I mean it's safer for me to run and then you bike and that's it that's me okay Sebastian you're up I run to the top of the stairs okay and see fluido getting stabbed by oh god four spawns and I get to the top I see this happening and I heard you scream and I'm just like am I the only one killing skeletons today so I'm gonna I'm gonna scorching ray again and I start blasting skeletons okay go for it fifteen that hits big money eight damage on the first one that destroys the one and then I'm going to blast the second one twenty five or seven damage blasts into it collapsing its ribcage but it continues to move forward I put my hand right up facing its skull and I fire one last time that giving a 12 that actually will hit oh good nice do he three more damage destroying it I don't know it's going away Pluto you're up stabby stabby ice-cream man lately and I stab the skeleton away from Sebastian 24 one two hit nice or four damage I'll hit it harder hey I keep I keep poking it through its rip holes 990 hit sorry sir and it's like the Spears like stuck in its ribcage and you're rattling around shaking but it's not damaged I'm gonna second wind and just stand there okay the bottom of the round Jupiter Jones goes he dashes forward saying you there cat lady is your other two friends the weird-looking redhead and and Pluto Jackson stuck in that house not stuck there fighting and killing all the monsters so they're doing all the heavy lifting for you he'll surely die of smoke inhalation I need to get there and save them before it's too late out of my way and he shows you and dashes into the room and is barreling across the floorboard sort of and it's saying don't worry by heroics we'll save the day does he know where we are he he gets into the landing and the looks are other rooms it turns back to vamp which way do they go into the first floor room just to the right right left which way is that again the door that's right there and I point to the door that's like towards Ludo underneath the weird-looking red head guy with goggles are you in here it's me Jupiter Jones I'm here to save you I at least have the skeleton I'm quietly getting stabbed okay Castel check with this advantage because you had taken some wounds and you were yelling out your stock can't give me this advantage when I already have disadvantage because you're exhausting I get a 12 I get a 4 so the rattling bones that you as you're trying to pull your music they're upstairs they any turns to you the two to you valances they've gone upstairs oh no that's even more dangerous up there the second floor is bound to collapse yeah I can go up there buddy it's gonna collapse oh I should stay up here music are you sure yeah make a deception check fifteen he looks back at you says your light-footed here take this rope we'd go up there and tie it to them and then I'll use my strength to pull them back down we'll work together okay let's do the rope the end of the rope don't worry pull it once when you found them or pull it twice if you get into trouble and I'll pull you back to safety will do Jupiter run through the house and up the stairs do do I see anything I can you see the two of them yeah is there anything that I see that I can tie the rope to like a door handle or anything like that no skeleton don't even tie it hi guys do I see anything like a door handle I can tie it too there are two of the doors are blown off their hinges but there is the other door across from from polute oh there that you could conceivably tie the rope on to drive enough movement together run it from the you don't have your feline agility available currently no so you would need to travel 60 feet to get their eye to the door or up the stairs to get to the door okay can I get up the stairs and see the skeletons at least okay that I know you already moved there yeah okay then I'm going to drop the end of the rope and take out my crossbow and I take two shots of that towards the skeletons okay might as well help kill these monsters 17 that's a hit fifteen damaged no the skeleton you catch one of the skeletons in its shoulder blades blowing off parts of its parts of its skeletal body and sending it flying ice I take a shot at the other one with my crossbow ten the bolt sales rate happens with arrows and skeletons you know so bony Sebastian yup and I can hear Jupiter just being oh yeah he's he's yelling and I turned to you pluton my clue to you you have this under control ah okay there's something I have to do and I yell downstairs and I'm like Jupiter look out there's some vicious hound and as a bonus action I SiC my new spectral hound on Jupiter and not to hurt him but it's just gonna run up to him and I'm gonna pop back down the stairs you need to be able to see the space that you see it where you summon it and and I believe you have to be able to see the creature that you're gonna stick it on to so let's just double check this because I want this to work I want this to work it's cool but but I gotta make sure that you can say I mean worst case I can move down the stairs and yell it at him yeah so I move down the stairs so I can see him and I yell Jupiter look out there's a giant hound up here that we're fighting and the Hound I'm gonna actually summon it behind me so that it runs at him because he's near the bottom of the stairs right now right yes he is so the Hound runs up to him and then I'm actually gonna pull out my wand and I'm gonna say run and I cast command on him okay with disadvantage because of the Hound the wand isn't a spell Oh nuts it's a 20 on the signature and he doesn't run but he still might be afraid of a giant hound make a deception check to see if you can conceal your sorcery 26 okay he sees the giant hulking hound and says this is no time to run fire and shadow are taking over this entire building he draws his blade stand back brave it's weird-looking goggled redheaded man I will slay this horrible beast putting out a fire and slaying monsters are two of my favorite things okay great thanks and I go back in old stairs I like and I knew gumption does he sell the rope in his him he does cool Ludo you're up I'm gonna try to I'm gonna attempt to stab this this skeleton 19 that's a head for seven damage you cut it down yeah nope and then I'm going to so I just crumble him with with with a mighty blow and then I run towards the the broken door of the room how bad is the fire is it but it is raging all around and the blackened I cores that are the black hip fluid that is leaking from the mirror is seeping through the floor and dripping down into the room below the mirror miraculously seems undamaged by the flame but the pathway from here to the mirror is fraught with flame oh is Fairs road trip rope trick still going yeah the Rope still hang in there there's flames looking up and down the world but it's still there is there any like I don't want to say containers of water but like is their containers of water there might be in the pantry okay I'm gonna head towards the pantry it's downstairs I'm going to head downstairs okay you move back towards the stairs and you're our eye to eye with Lord Jupiter Jones Hey Caspian friends and he cry he cries Oh Pluto you look awful what's happened to you you've clearly inhaled too much smoke and are weaker than a kitten well almost this week is that cat person that I saw earlier I see a friend of yours correct yes quickly leap into my arms and I will carry you to safety I do it i leap it at Jupiter YouTube okay and I and I do like the but the but first one like catch me catch me Jupiter there is also a hound okay no no okay Jupiter Jones with his prodigious strength scoops you up throwing you over his shoulder Oh other hand and he attacks the house getting a a 25 and a 27 to hit the house yeah takes 20 points of damage from the two attacks as he slices into it and he says back you mangy fiend you will take the soul of a single Caspian this day and and he might say and he turns to you Pluto and says Pluto you might be a you might be a Jackson but you're still a Caspian and you will not die on this day oh he's so strong manly Jupiter playing into it and he turns to he turns to move away from the hound who can take an opportunity attack he's gonna bleed he's gonna believe me do I get pack tactics cuz pluto's yeah he's holding a rope and a sword and a Pluto yes you do get pack tactics cuz ya like a R but are you are you trying to impair him in some way like no I well I mean I'm I'm kind of I wasn't just him to catch me yeah he did I will give him give the hound advantage that's sixteen that's a Miss he's got a c-17 so pollute Oh with with little you're carried by Jupiter Jones towards the front of the house over his shoulder with the sword he's like poking it back towards the hound and he steps out of the night sky and says there are people within the house we must act quickly to save them oh absolutely now he looks like a hero and he points at two of his other men you two men there's a crazy cat lady and another redheaded weirdo still in the building take Lord Jackson and Brer him to safety and the other two run forward and start collecting you pollute oh and Burt and hurry you in the end of the crowd as he as he drops you onto the ground I must go back into the building and save the other two I had this whole plan to make you look so cool and it's just you've lost all points I made you better carry me out of the house I kind of wild now he looks oh yeah yeah he's kind of my sir I need new servants I must rejoin the team okay top of the round bale you're up do I still have an upper rope to tie it to the still intact door yes you do okay I walk up the door tie the rope to the handle and I pulled twice and then I move towards the balcony okay he still got his hand on the rope yeah and he feels the tug and he cries out oh that cat person has found that has found someone else I must drag them forward to safety Sebastian it's your turn how far into the room can I get here let's see is it like horrible in here it is truly horrible in here I'm gonna try to get to the mirror okay there is fire everywhere give me a dexterity savings 18 you nimbly leap through the licking and roaring flames avoiding the worst of the damage but as you leap over the wreckage in front of you there's a loud crack on the floorboards in front of you it feels like the floor is going to give out in front of you what are you going to do dive forward you die forward okay make an acrobatics j19 you leap forward landing prone in front of the mirror as a large section of the floor collapses underneath you and gives out into the ground below the fire is raging all around you what do you that's been your your movement for the round what are you gonna do with your action can i sunder step with the mirror the mirror is an object not a creature if I'm carrying it like if I grab it and hug it and like try to lift you can try to lift it but I'll need you to make a strength jacket good you're so strong I believe in you mm-hmm that's a four try to lift it but to no avail if you could get it into the bag of holding you would be able to teleport away with it I take off my bag of holding and I'm gonna start I probably can't do at this round but I'm gonna start trying to like shove okay the mirror into the bag of holding okay sure yeah it has a two foot diameter opening anything it's like a big sack yeah yeah okay sure it's it's dimensional great enough Pluto you're up he's pulled you outside there and he's not holding on to me anymore though right I reckon with the rest of the crowd I run back into that you run back forward he says Pluto what are you doing I saved you Jupiter I'm fine we need to get Baio the cat and my goggled friend you can bring objects with you with thunder stuff as long as they don't exceed your total carrying capacity does it exceed my total carry weighs a hundred pounds yeah it sounds big how much do you weigh what are you gonna do put so I'm gonna run back into the the building okay it just I just wanted to be I just wanted to have like a little luxury you know I'd like to be carried I like to be open seed I'd like to be romanced okay you run back towards the building I run back into the the building and I'm gonna start I'm gonna - and I'm gonna action surge and I'm gonna - - we're all the way back upstairs into the room with Sebastian so you can cover 90 feet so you're back up to the entrance of the bedroom and Jupiter is just like what are you doing man I ignore him completely are there more people in the building valuables pets don't risk your life for the sake of a pet I know she's she's just a cat man she's not a cat man she's a cat lady thank you I can lift 120 pounds by the way okay and how about your hearing right now just figure that out how can I make it to Sebastian so if I go you can make it to the entrance of the room 30 feet + - + action surge + - do I get a hundred and twenty feet of movement it would be move - - so that would be a 90 feet Oh true yeah yeah I make it I get all the way there okay and I yell sober Street to be here to the entrance of the room Sebastian okay the floor on the second level starting to give away make it x2 already saving through those those reminder that Oh actually those for you in nineteen it so the floorboard collapse underneath the flames but you're able to avoid most of the fire and get back up to their world okay I took the long way back on the round Jupiter Jones grabs the rope and begins pulling it cat lady I hope this is tied to someone Ludo I'm going to come for you in a moment and he starts pulling at the rope he's like it seems like it's stuck on something bull order border blurted it says I'm gonna have to go in and get it and he rushes forward to it towards the base of the stairs because he's spent his action to the hole so he's at the bottom of the stairs now don't go bad there's lots of fire keep pulling don't come up jump fail it's your turn what are you gonna do I am mmm you guys are trying to get the mirror I have zero strength I'll probably be to help to get the mirror so I go outside the balcony and start to climb down the building okay and I start to yeah I'm just gonna move out of the building and as far away from I can from the building alright lens sees you crawl down and she say I thought you were supposed to be helping Jupiter Jones find your friends he thinks that you're like a pet that's stuck in the building yeah shut up LEM and you're so short I'm in Nome what's your Excuse I'm not sure so much I yell back to the building keep pulling I guess you don't like your friends and

to my face fight me IRL well we'll see what happens on his turn Sebastian what are you gonna do so I turn and I see Pluto in the doorway yelling my name Sebastian uh I can't like the the mirror will pass my max carrying capacity okay so I had I do have a thunder step ready if Pluto is carrying the mirror I can thunder step with with all of that because it will be an object that he's carrying as long as the mirror as long as everything is both under both of your combined commits carrying capacities um I grab one end of the mirror I reach out a hand to Pluto and I'm like I need you here right now and I'm gonna ready an action to thunder step when Pluto gets here and helps takes up the mayor yeah okay pollute oh are you gonna be able to carry the mirror with everything that you have on your person reduced ranks so my strength right now is twelve okay twelve times 15 is 200 and okay so with your arm where I think you're okay right 1215 yeah if if you don't think I would drop like my shield like it is it appropriate do you think it's so I think you're okay so I'm gonna if it's if it's old Pluto I I stand in the doorway I see you holding at your hand and I I start to leap through

fancy lady Cape across the room so you BAM I jump I disappear in a puff of smoke appear right beside Sebastian take his hand and then you Thunder step back with the mirror come on mo Mayra I'm amazing is Emir so goofy it is it's still Jupiter keep pulling keep pulling now's your chance to go in and land with a pop in front of the in front of a very startled crowd good evening folks my name is Sebastian Crowe and I have defeated all the monsters in this building you're welcome but we still have Jupiter Jones to save who's with us we must save him yeah really 180 that I start like commanding like I do what Jupiter Jones is doing and I start being like you guys get the water flowing into this building Pluto ghost go bring Jupiter Jones out of here carry image over over the din of that Jupiter Jones walks out the front of that that the house because he was just at the bottom level and he says is there anyone else in the house that needs to be saved did you save the person at the end of the rope oh oh no get out here and help me and he keeps pulling and pulling and the door snaps off and he pulls it down the stairs and he sees the door and he looks up at you and says oh no what's happened they've turned into a door Oh it's been some intense magic in that house it's a haunting people into doors probably other thing we can do for them we've all got to get back in there and make sure that there's no one else that's in that burning building Jupiter we need to put the fire out where your priorities come on Brian let's get to it then men and ladies and everyone else let's put out this fire together and as he says it's horrible collapsing crap and it falls again and is he like facing us collapses again and he turns and looks at it and says oh oh no well hmm I guess that's the end of that house at least it's still your land at least we have a mirror yeah do I still own this property your dad does we can rebuild we have the technology trick still there it's invisible the ropes burned away and you didn't actually put the mirror into the bag of holding you just teleported directly out with it yeah yeah we get so right into the beers we wanted to do all this stuff we have to find a new spot for the mirror yeah not at your dad's house no and with that the people of the town look at you look you've heard of Jones say and one of the people goes so you just couldn't live and let live you had to come back and finish what you started didn't you crow listen there was an incident yeah there's been a lot of incidents one of the people saying one of the other says yeah yeah he's some side kind of sorcerer someone says I heard he's all got that magic he was probably up to no good and that house burning things down what's he doing with that mirror and people start yelling out and saying things why is he doing some sort of profane ritual with that thing and someone says my meemaw said that she saw a weird skeletons and necromancy coming around here just a few minutes ago someone else is oh he's doing some awful black magic that thing what's up what's all that black stuff leaking out of that mirror that's really weird people are like freaking out I pull out my wand and I point it at the crowd and I yell shut up this situation is under control I am a sorcerer I work for the mages guild and this was mages guild business this situation is over and you all need to go home make an intimidation check that's a 20 on the dice so 28 the only sound you can hear is the crackling of the flames of the rest of building collapses and the crowd begins to disperse silently few people still mumbling under their breath people dropping the buckets of water as the crowd disperses it locks away and Jupiter Jones just turns teases I'm sorry about your old house it looked like a nice place thanks for trying to help chupa tur as the crowd disperses we're even now for the whole troll thing oh absolutely not Jupiter I I mean your your your Drive is appreciated yet unnecessary my my muscle and my Herald and myself have everything under control if you as we said singed with like a mirror doubling back into the building like a madman I would have had everything under complete control and we would have been putting out the fire before the building even collapsed weren't you pulling on a door the only thing he saved out of this you saved a door and you were supposed to tie it to one of your friends so I could pull them to safety we saved ourselves so I think you know figured try to save some of the good wood from this place I could have still been in there pulling on that door when the building collapsed probably we all made it out and under our own according so much I thought this was an opportunity for a wonderful partnership but it seems like all you all just have your own egos to serve you're all some real jerks you know that oh I do feel a little bad I I sit on the ground and just am staring at my rubble house he turns to lemon says let's get out of here LEM am I the evil one and LEM as a diseases you all are is awful and hate-filled and burning on the inside as that house is on the outside we're leaving and if we see you again in a burning building dying we're not gonna help you next time we're just gonna walk and let that house burn and you could all die in a fire well there would have to be a first time for there to be a next time of you helping because you didn't help do squat today walk away LEM walk away I mean they do walk away and they don't turn around and now we're alone in front of the ashes of my home and we're all jerks and we treated them like jerks III can't leave it like that they're not wrong I'm gonna run up I'm gonna catch up to Pluto where I take to Jupiter wait I SiC my spectral hound on on Jupiter an attempt to make him look foolish and tried to make him flee I think I took my rivalry with him a little too far I really just wanted to see him fail and I I'm gonna catch my house birthday you may not have failed but he didn't succeed as as you run forward to catch up to Jupiter you can see that at the edge of the crowd still standing there in Sebastian's father River we're so in trouble mm-hmm you know when you get that feeling that you're in trouble I'm still sitting on my front lawn staring at the building because I I don't I don't feel good about any of this and I don't even want to talk to my friends and family right now about this situation this incident I pop Agera table she's sorry about your house I want I there there's there's a code with caspia and and he he didn't let me he didn't just sit by and watch like some would do he he ran into a burning building and we and we took we took advantage of his honor and his I know Jupiter wait you you what do you want I'm sorry you thank you for helping us try to put out the fire and for carrying me for about those forty feet you're really strong and and I and I and I put out my hand to do the Caspian fist bump and I say yeah we're even he fist bumps you back and class was hand to pull you into a bear hug and he says under his breath if you ever pull something like this again that will be the limit of my honor your little cat friend is a real sneak and she has no honor how can you tell that you can trust her sometimes you just got to follow your follow your heart Jupiter she's a mangy cat and she'll turn your but her back on you at the first opportunity I can tell I can see it in her eyes she only cares about herself she has no honor be careful around her and watch that uh watch that gnome friend of yours - I can see a lack of manners pouring from his his stained mouth you know he doesn't he doesn't speak for caspian x' I know you do I would rather have a oil companion if an ill-mannered one than someone that I rather than someone who I didn't who I couldn't trust not to leave me to die in the streets of this God's forsaken City well then I I can only hope that you're wrong for your sake I hope I am an eternal good luck I can't leave I can't leave on bad Jupiter he tried his best you did for that door you know just like when we saved him from the troll like you know I couldn't let him I can't let him die he's my blood he's my people I feel awful and then I turned around to look at your dilapidated I was and I there's a mirror sitting in the in the middle of the lawn and and the mage guild people are so mad I think are they here did they look mad they River and Alaric have their hoods drawn up as they walk close and your your father Tobias Crowe he turns and he put your hands on on the show on your shoulder Sebastian what's the first thing you can detect he says well that's one way to forget the past isn't it boy I suppose so suppose that's the silver lining if there is one here ashes to ashes and as he as he does so River says so you're working for the mage guild eh you did yell it I did you know it to a crowd of people and pointed your wand I may have gotten a little angry there and wanted to say something that made me seem less like I was just a troublemaking kid who just comes into this town and burns down buildings because that's what everybody here thinks of me and I'm I'm sorry well we've got a real problem on our hands now because these people are gonna talk about that crazy kid that just told them all off and they're going to say that he was working for the mage guild and that word is going to spread like the wildfire ripping through your family home you know what River mages guild has done me a great disservice I have so many questions that were not answered about my mother and the things I've discovered in the last few hours have left me to question the integrity of the mages guild and the entire organization I have so many questions and there were so many secrets kept from me so until I figure out what the hell's going on yeah I made a mess for you to clean up just like the mess of my entire life that you've left for me so thank you for that and you can tell my mentor over there thank him as well for this horrible situation this stupid mirror and my stupid mother that caused this whole thing to happen I stand right up behind Sebastian and put my hand on his shoulder and say you know he's right none of this would have happened if you had just told him about his mom I'm gonna create some symmetry and go on the other side and it's gonna be quiet okay and as the fire consumes the rest of crow mana and the embers rise up into the night sky that is where we're going to end for the night I got emotional good for you for Delano mom yeah you're growing up yeah see how that turns out next time no matter were just intense I feel like I've gotten further with Jupiter like I still need a rest and de level up I feel confusingly emotional about everything that's just happened and I don't I don't know I don't know what's going on if we just followed my feng shui guide we would have been everything would have been fine hmm so as I said last week y'all were supposed to take a rest and then gain the benefits of being level six but that didn't happen so do you in the last couple of minutes we have before we wrap up today I think you will take a rest here probably and we'll pick you back up the neck the following morning yeah how did you all level up what did you do I can start mines pretty straightforward I'm just gonna get that strength 220 currently it's 12 and and your poison strength will be restored with a rest those minutes to full 20 I got to start swinging and hitting harder I technically used my hound which was not supposed to be until I leveled up oops this is a cool moment I don't know it was on my sheet and I kept forgetting that I wasn't supposed to use things so I got my Hound of ill omen and I also exchanged one of my spells to get enlarged reduce and I've decided to take counter spell despite all the talk I was definitely gonna take haste and then last minute I decided the counter spell was possibly a better option so that's what I went with cool so veo has now multi class and has taken on the first level of rogue so I gained proficiencies in deception and expertise in stealth and perception Oh popping that stealth up to +10 so stealthy and sneak attack and thieves can't awesome awesome yeah we we had a little bit of a debate earlier before we started about what if you're gonna continue for with rogue and what subclass you might add on top of that so that's a pretty cool combo it's gonna be find you're building up there very appropriate for video as well so let's nique yeah yeah so that's uh that's where we're gonna end for the night level six is a pretty straightforward level I find it doesn't have like level 5 is kind of the exciting one but I think yes I'll pick up some from cool stuff there I so I want to give it a big thanks out to our cast Kelly Jill and Joe for playing our game and a huge thanks and shout out
