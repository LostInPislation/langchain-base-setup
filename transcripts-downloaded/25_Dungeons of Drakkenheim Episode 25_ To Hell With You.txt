Thieves extraordinarily pleased with the results of their surrender the queen of Thieves has agreed to spare their lives resting her laurels on the public humiliation of the party in front of the assembled Queen's men with that the queen of Thieves has agreed to return the possessions to our heroes - Bao's badge belonging to her father the ring of Queen Lenore von Kessel that Sebastian had taken from her and the box and key that the amethyst Academy had entrusted to our heroes this mysterious delirium based weapon which is now in hand of the enigmatic Queen of Thieves what she could be planning to do with some sort of horrible device of mass destruction is anyone's guess but it is now in her possession she has agreed however to exchange Bao's badge for another valuable trinket from amongst the relics of the small Council of Drakon hime should our heroes ever locate one your possessions returned to you a stipend of gold and your tentative agreement with the queen of thieves for a short term of non-aggression and a long-term working relationship ended with you all being escorted back to a small stone room with some relatively soft beds for you to pack it in for the night and rest it's better than the cells we were in night before so sure I always like to sleepovers with you guys it's nice I mean it's been a few months of us constantly sleeping over but yeah I'm comfortable as you awake in the morning the first thing that you notice is that the beds are on the opposite side of the room and the door has moved from the side of the room it was on the other side of the room are you sleep renovating again it wasn't me I mean I toss and turn a little bit in my sleep aren't you the one that screams in your anime did I scream to the point where our beds turned I haven't had night terrors though since I faces my doggy fears so okay if it wasn't me and it wasn't Vale and I don't know how to do that you don't know how to move beds now they're breaking them I would only know how to throw it against the wall and the only logical explanation is that we were moved during the night or magic or the or magic or magic magic is a pretty good catch-all for most things that happen to us in Jack and I'm how did we end up here magic does it look like the same room make an investigation check 24 well attention to detail has been paid to make the room look similar they were both very Spartan rooms to begin with judging by just the bed it the bedding the shape of everything looking around paying attention to the details that you saw the room previously there's a few Nicks on the bed and scuffs on the floors that indicate that this might be a different room entirely yeah I've seen you sleep you like sleep with like one or both eyes open usually yeah and your bow drawing Billy intense it's terrifying how did this get past us and you always mumble like this like you said you say it like just under your breath I'm pretty sure you've cast a first strike on yourself in your sleep before when you see like an animal running and it's sleep you just run so far okay so how are we moved then is there a door still yes I can open the door you open the door check outside um and we still before you the the door opens into what appears to be a cellar with a short set of stairs leading up from the doorway itself so the door opens in into the room right and then there's a short set of stairs leading upwards about five feet that go into that look like they're going into a long abandoned cellar well I say we go up yeah no other way but up slowly start to creep up the stairs you creep up the stairs and you can see that as you get to the top of the stairs you see that there are wooden floorboards covering the cellar ahead and there's just the a verse latest cracks of light coming through the floorboards above although the light curiously doesn't spill down the staircase stops abruptly at the top of the stairs I want to listen for any sound sure I give me a perception checking 12:12 cool sounds quiet there is the the lo patter of light rain that can be heard so regular day in Jaken gold Jaken time but all rainy check slightly get outside take a look I push open the top you're you're at the top of the stairs leading into the room so there's nothing to push oh it just walk it just walks in oh my god as you walk through behind you the wall here is solid oh secret room again if I pad on the wall where I came out of is it solid no it's not your hand goes right here I poke my head back to be like hey guys she's completely visible yeah what are you doing we're just watching you like I'm like I assume I'm like a floating head at this point cuz I don't know magic it's just it's just magic all right she's having body I know I go through and then I turn around I'm like oh yeah we all get it okay so so we found a secret entrance way into out of Thieves area yeah into a room that we don't know how we ended up in so that's kind of a problem yeah we don't really know how we got there the room that you were in there were a few foot lockers with some provisions basic clothing some bits of leather armor some ammunition a few daggers a few things that could be used to keep somebody safe for a little while but the cellar itself has a rough wooden staircase leading up into the remains of what looks like to be an old workshop there are some tools strewn about lots of extra pairs of shoes was a cobbler's workshop so there's the horn that cobblers would use to work with and it smells rough leather can I put together like a cobblers toolkit yes you could yes I'm taking our cobblers toolkit I assume there's some polishing tools because I think I need to find a way to keep myself clean but now I want to elevate my cleanliness there there there are some some rags and some shoe shine that's what I want some oil yeah you're probably used to shine shine leather yeah better treat leather I just laugh at you most of the place has been ransacked but of course and in interestingly enough there's not a single matched pair of shoes in the entire place because any matching pair of boots would be an extremely high well commodity in dragon hein so there's just several lost souls I don't even wear shoes go barefoot I heard their cat call tonight the most of the roof of the old cobblers place has been blown off and so you can see that you are deep in the middle of the spokes south of the main part of the city and several large city blocks away from buckle down well well I guess we're we're out yeah yeah so I mean we've talked to the Queen we know we need to get we still got a little bit of time before we're gonna have to go see the commander right when you see we know what we need to get you mean for the Queen yeah like we're working for the Queen she knows about my dad I need to I need to do what she says to get that information this is getting really confusing with all of these different friends I'd you to your dad my dad maybe on a good day he made you some nice Armour between friends and allies though interesting right Manas deep yeah difference between friends and allies yeah you guys are my friends my best friends you wouldn't eat us if you were really hungry and trapped in that room let's say how many days would you eat wait before you ate my face I mean I can I can go a long time without food I don't like do I value food I wouldn't your faces right away maybe you're not nice thank you yes start with the extremities I really appreciate that can only save the face for last oh yeah I need I need the face that's what eyes we fought we fought it we fought a dinosaur we lost we lost to a dinosaur what's a dinosaur flash before my eyes a lizard agree we haven't done that in like than like maybe two three times in like 15 years I visit death often I welcome it sometimes I remember the first week that I knew you you were almost eaten by rats on more than one occasion so I don't put it past here I i have not faced death nearly as many times as i have in Drakon i usually I'm pretty efficient at my job that's not I mean I guess that is death literally there was a death dog that was dragging me through the gates of hell so taking stock of what we know and what we need to do I mean we still have a couple days towards the fight there's there's one group that we kind of haven't seen yet now we need to the they're not a we don't want do we use the word cult I I openly use the word cult with them the followers of the following fire when we're with them we should probably try to be a little softer members they're the only people that we haven't talked to in Drakon I mean technically we didn't really talk to the Noles very much but they don't they don't seem to talk and we haven't in we help that old man if we find him you say you might like didn't he say something like come on back anytime place Cornelius is that you no that's just one of my voices like he said that we were welcome there right yeah they're really the only ones we haven't kind of takes taking stock of to figure out if well we we said the thieves we know they're not gonna interfere with our upcoming battle well we know that we have the Queen's word I mean she did spare our lives I think I think this plays into our favor not to interfere with this part she's gonna get gained more values by letting it this happen I do think it's important that we talk to the occult just because once we do we can really I think that we need to have a dragon force meeting about who who were with what's our goals what are but it is important that we meet this last faction first because things are getting a little messy here in Drakon hime there's so many factions they all want us to do different things we thought we were going in to kill the queen of Thieves and like dismantle her Queen's men but instead we ended up coming out working for them so things are getting very complicated very quickly yeah we need to like well I think once we meet the new faction we'll make some charts we'll do some pros and cons lists yeah well figure out the maps and figure out where we lie and where we said and whether we just want to make our own facts for news and I mean if anybody wants to know if anybody wants to talk about like you know your father or who George is or how you got expelled from school yeah we could talk about that okay Pluto I'll make you a deal okay we've been friends a while now right best friends best friends do you trust me I trust you with your life I saved you I do okay cool cool if you tell me your secret I'll tell you mine okay do I just get I just get this for free then I mean oh you're you're kind of an open book like I don't know is there some big secret about your dad that you're not telling us cuz I'm pretty sure your whole thing is you're looking for your dad and you think he's in the castle and we need to get in that castle it's not way there's probably leads in that castle little bit do you know he's in there any like deep buried regrets I mean there's that one time where I ate a pigeon what I ate a pigeon but you love pigeon one of your pigeons she was so great did she made three beautiful baby pigeons that I've been taking care of for the years that I've been a dragon home is that why you have the three pet pigeons yes wait when you say she was great you mean like she was great she was delicious the brightest you know that's why she got eaten in there in the groups oh okay yeah but her her babies some of the best best companions I've ever had other than you guys as you share your stories are you going to travel or are you gonna stay in one place yeah let's walk towards the gate okay let's bring up our map so right now you are you have awoken in just kind of at the bottom edge of the map in that area of large kind of ramshackle buildings so it's almost a straight shot North champions way from here or you could head towards champions way and then head down the road itself towards champions gate is that the way that you want to go or is there another route that you want to take that that's a pretty safe route like we have we we haven't run into much trouble in and around champions gate have we the if you're if you recall champions way is the path that you've seen the pilgrims of the falling fire to take before it's also the hunting ground for most of the Queen's men fair we kind of have leeway that way we have a bit of leeway I'm not too concerned we're still wearing our purple bandanas is it purple red we had purple ones you're still gonna be wearing those if we're gonna approach the yeah that's true plus we can just kill any Queens when they come up to us cuz we were I think we're pretty renowned now like unless it's big Lynda we pretty much kill everything else yeah do they have a lot of big Linda's wandering the streets probably not I think there's only one so I think we didn't really get anything from the Queen to tell them not to but I'm hoping the word spread that where they know that were big time superb so you take the you head down the streets towards champions way and then you'll be marching op champions way towards champions gate so that's a point three on the map so no thank you a little bit of time to get there it's it's a rather cold day in tracking home today but the a light breeze has brought in more of a light rain as well but as a result the fog and the haze isn't as heavy as it usually is so that your visibility is actually quite good and with that you're able to continue along your way with your little chat as you head towards champions gate so I spilled my secret yeah that's great now we know your one and only secret and I don't know who's George who's George George is my nephew oh you have a big family I have a private extended family most of them are back in caspia but George is significant because it's this is he's he kinda sorta might be could be heir to Jack and I'm like I mean like I may be a little bit like what hold on just try to slip that in that no that's huge Pluto yeah you've been spending months in track and I'm trying to find an heir no no we've been trying to find the heirs not a heir yeah but I mean there are multiple errors how does okay now I'm gonna be in the middle yeah how does that work it's it's kind of complicated but my sister who I also loved dearly she kinda sorta got pregnant from one of the Von Kessler's out of wedlock and now you can understand why there's a little bit of importance for me to find certain documents yeah that was that what you talk to the Queen about it the cat in that bathing look Oh what watching you guys almost died really I feel like you're on borrowed time right now feel like we all it's okay I feel like we all are and the thing is is that I don't want to keep you in the dark anymore I don't know why you didn't come to a sooner like this is this just you you know you can trust me but I don't know I can trust you till I can trust you hey oh can we trust you yeah are you happy how do you feel about that how do you feel about George you know what I think if the documents say that he's the heir and he's there I mean I'm all about official ways of doing things but if he's trying to sneak in Vanessa no no well Pluto said that he had no he had no goals of changing the documents so I mean as long as as long as yeah I trust you I trust us to find them and go by what they say tell me more about your family who else do you have at home you have a girlfriend pretty girlfriend boyfriend yeah well it doesn't matter no big deal well yeah I call her my wife but you'll all change I love secret sharing keep going we're more like engaged but you know I mean it's not official you haven't locked it down yet my the problem is is that our family's been kind of in torment ever since the meteor fell I understand that and I mean coming on several months in Drakon Heim can really change a person and their views and their interests keep your hand look supportive look it's it's it's hard to explain but if I need to restore balance to Dragonite I'm on fourth I I think there needs to be balance in this and caspia can prosper from it especially my family because right now my family's kind of like we're kind of the black sheep the kind of overturned if you will we've lost a huge sense of power and this could help bring us back into the like so I owe this to my to my my sister my parents my fiance if you will my everyone in here's here's my question for you Pluto is do you do you think that George and your family I know that you were probably sent on this mission to try to make sure the caspia had a claim to dragon hunt is your family good do you do you think that they're good people do you think the painting what is good don't don't do that well well I think good people can act badly and bad people connect I don't know what you're talking I don't think it's that clear I don't know are we good to the Noles yeah think about it are we good to like the Queen I don't know like doing your best in the circumstance what I can tell you is that I the city is in ruins and it needs to evolve and it needs to be sort of there needs to be a sense of order restored and I think we can all agree that that's what's best for dragon man we can't there can't be like a poison fog chi'lan that mutates people all the time like that's that like if that was your house would you still live there I was you say these words you look forward how long champions way and you can see the rising haze coming up from where the great crater is in the distance did you come closer towards Champions Gate the devastation is so much clearer on the ground here than anywhere else high up from the clock tower looking on this part of the district the fog and the haze above conceals just how much of it is now a fog covered ruin the walls along the southern portion of Drakon Hein there is a great rent in them and most of them have been almost completely toppled with just normally that they're like 60 feet high but it's actually hard to see as you come up along champions way where the walls rise up over the ruins surrounding them unlike everywhere else in the city where when you're this close you can there the walls are imposing but particularly you can see that blast point we're just even looking down along the ground you can see chunks of masonry that look like they might have come from city walls and the rooftops are very clearly all blasted from the ruins on on one side as if the city walls are just catapulted like like all over this part of the city and even looking down as you can see thanks to the the more dispersed fog you can see that even champions gates is crumbled in in many respects the the whole area is devoid of even the trace amounts of vegetation and veio from what you know though this area of the city though is the faster for finding pieces of delirium where all the money comes from a good salmon - nothing as you continue forward down champions way hey guys would you live in a house full of poison probably not but thanks for sharing you know it thank you so much like it I feel so relieved to know these things about you I I didn't want to make it seem like I just felt like it was there was a time that was appropriate and I didn't want my intentions to be misconstrued I have no qualms with Devon Castle I mean honestly the more options we have for heirs to track and how my trick the better their family as far as I'm concerned their family and this is this is like my summer home you know like my this is like my my villa in Europe and my only hope well I mean this has been a great and I wanted to bring it back like it deserves to be my yeah it can be everybody summer home let's march forward what about you Sebastian what shared our secret Sebastian alright alright okay serious I feel like you disappeared for 15 years you came back and you're a different person yeah you guys know about the whole me getting kind of shipped off to a hammer fist Academy magic school cuz I had a nightmare about a meteor hitting Drakon hime and then like days later the meteor hit dragon hime that was the beginning of the weirdness no the beginning of the weirdness was my first but anyway why I got kicked out of school that is something that I don't talk about a lot and it was actually very carefully covered up by the amethyst Academy because for our for most intents and purposes I I would have been probably like killed if they had found out if people had found out what I had done I don't know is it was it wasn't the best moment of my life were you young I was young I was learning magic and I was in love who there was so my friends growing up I had veil when I was a kid she was like my only friend I didn't have a lot of friends growing up it was I don't know nobody kids were mean and so my my friends were a few and far between when I when I joined the amethyst Academy I had River and then I met one other person that I got along with and her name was Kat not know it not a cup she would her name was Kat and she had a younger sister who we called mouse yeah it was adorable I really liked them both and I thought I would impress them by showing them some magic that I I was working on and I knew but you guys know about the dog that kept me up at night screaming and the night terrors and it dragging me to hell yeah I tried to summon that dog to impress them yeah it it didn't work I I wasn't I wasn't strong enough and Mouse the younger sister she she got dragged to help right in front of us and I panicked and I fled and the amethyst economy found out they covered up the whole thing I never saw Kat again and I was kicked out of the school and that's when I left this whole area to go pursue a life of hunting down people using my magic powers to kill people because I decided that that's what I was best at and maybe I could do some good in the world and so I wanted to just disappear for a while and try to make a good name for myself because I was sick of doing wrong I was sick of just every time that I tried to use magic it caused problems it caused accidents and made mayhem and now here we are in Drakon hime I'm still trying to use magic she's still trying to understand what I am what I'm doing and I just keep making trouble for everybody and it scares me and I still not over that and the fact that the Queen knows what happened is really scary because the amethyst Academy covered the whole thing up it was it was kind of swept under the rug nothing happened and my name was kind of erased from any anything to do with that and I was hoping that it would never come up again and it did but the Queen can get anywhere it doesn't surprise me that she get any information she wanted on us mm-hmm she'd be tricking you to she when you but she knows about it just as a mind reader you know in humans so that also doesn't I mean it either way I'm not comfortable with the fact that she knows that's that's really concerning to me because I don't know that's just like this statement of all of my problems and all of the incidents I've caused even without those incidents we probably wouldn't be alive yeah it's the trying that separates us no we're trying now when it drags an innocent girl to hell you also drag like other things yeah there were monsters yeah so like there's balance not yet for me there's not I still feel like I have a ways to go before I feel balanced I think the more you learn about what you can do potentially there's maybe a way we can okay yeah what if what if you you can summon the dog now easily so maybe I can I mean my goal has always been to become powerful enough to find a way to to get her back I don't ever want to see cat again until I can like be like hey whatever happened to can I don't know you lose touch well I I'm afraid to talk to her and like I did I ran away I disappeared and like what am I gonna do like hey it's been like six years since I saw you sorry about your sister happier oh yeah I don't I don't know no no I think that you know if it's your goal to become more powerful and get mouse back then however we can help you do that maybe it means maybe it means trying something again like yeah you keep trying stuff and I died that's again it's like separate to you something that does make me nervous that I have thought of his the the demon that we keep running into yeah but I've been afraid to ask him about that because I don't know I don't want to know the answers I'm not the whole thing makes me nervous we're gonna figure it out that's it that's maybe we go to hell get her back just like she was dragged down there we drag her back would you do that I'd go to hell with you I would I love you guys I love you guys guys do ever can we can we walk in in the hug in the hug walk and you continue forward through the ruins around champions way you can hear far-off a few screams and the clash of metal against metal we're ignoring it we're having to we're having a moment people fighting and as you come around the alley you can see what looks like a pair of there are two Queen's men a man and a woman both covered in flecks of blood running down the street away from champions gate pursuit running towards us they're kind of they're running away from the gate and you're heading towards the the gate and they've just come out of one of the the there's several other streets in this area and they've kind of run out off of champions away itself and into one of the alleys down down the way yeah pursuit yeah let's should we I'm gonna run after all right I'm following because I'm I consider myself a guarded dragon okay I better join to make sure you don't get into too much trouble oh come on so I start to like jog so that way I'm not running ahead of them okay best walk you run run forward to the alley that they ran down and you find the two of them slumped against the wall breathing heavily and they they look up at you and it's a man and a woman the man has a short mohawk and the the woman has short hair they're both wearing leather armor nothing particularly impressive about them in terms of their equipment or anything it seems like one of them or one of of them might have dropped their weapons and they're both slightly wounded they one looks like she's she's got like a nick on her side and the other man looks like he took a mace to the face and they the man looks up at you and says and he just says oh no please please we're just we're just trying to survive my name is Sebastian Karl I'm here to help you where do you need why is there blood I think that's his blood is that your blood face don't come up with this way there's there's a bunch of those nut cases up the way up there and you know we were just trying to have a friendly conversation with them and one of them just tore a friend farley in half the occult I mean the followers yeah those those nut cases there's a bunch of them all heading up towards the gate there we we just wanted to have a nice chat with them you know this is our territory they got to pay the taxes right I've seen what nice conversations happen with thieves but oh no no we weren't trying to rip him off or anything we promise but they they just freaked out at us they were so angry and I mean I've lived through tax season I understand getting angry about it I they just attacked you you were just talking and they attacked you I've never I mean I've only met them once but I've never known been dating this guy up and down is he is he seemed aboveboard making insight Jack come on I'm not convinced yeah seven he seems scared the fear in his eyes is very genuine whether or not his story makes sense you're not sure so do you want us to go have a chat with them just as long as they don't come back this way and kill us no you're coming with us we should send them on their way and we'll go deal with deal we'll go have a converse or yeah we won't bother those folks again Italy not that group of them what weather what what group are you with oh we're we're with the thrushes flashes huh we're the uh we're with the purple petals oh oh you don't have any marks on you going incognito then I mean worse we're about to go through that gate so we don't really we want to be inconspicuous woman speaks up she says that's I'm Roz this is Finkel look at what we just tried to rip them off and they have this really big guy that was really angry and he's got a huge ax and he chopped barley in half so what lesson did you learn today they're coming in bigger groups they got more people protecting them it was really really something else I just thought they were a bunch of just average people most of them are but you'll see when they got them they got some I got some new friends well maybe if people weren't trying to beat them up in the streets as often they wouldn't need to get big friends we'll go check it out except you're gonna leave your valuables are you we got nothing left I'd enter your pockets they have a bag of its tax collecting season you called it they have roughly eight gold pieces in about forty silver between the two of them I mean how much is the taxes well we were hoping they would have some Delirium on them do you have any deliria not that I needed but but I need it but I have a craving root rumor is they're sitting on a mother lode in there I mean the craters right there yeah intense you always coming out to pick over as well you run into them all the time oftentimes they're better at finding it than us so you just find a bunch of them they just found a bunch of delirium you know what I mean I do know what you mean and that's why you just bought yourself your life for eight gold and forty silver sounds like a deal can we go now you can go and they they rush Oh Pluto Jackson am i rubbing off on you am I I felt I feel power I feel good I deeds I hate these thieves yeah and I'm not gonna I'm not going to any more blood if I don't have to but you're gonna they acquire this gold through bad means and I'm gonna return it to its rightful owner I lose your pocket no it's gonna be to the we're gonna go we're gonna go see you where Farley we're gonna go meet the two Farley's the party twins I also think there's a difference between survival what I've been doing for 15 years and thieving and taking advantage taken that eat gold and started a small little traveling band but they chose their life yep okay so and you heard them they're gonna rip him off yeah he did say that so I'm taking that bag of gold and you're we're taking from the and we're gonna give back poor and giving to the poor I want to give back to the as a token of good faith I think it was a bargain thing steal from the poor to the other poor we decide how who's we are the poor to spend for it yeah yeah okay we're heading forward you were the big guys go meet Farley it doesn't take long for you to catch out after this other group you're only a few blocks now away from champions gate anyways but as you come forward through the through the twisting path of Champions way there is a very large group of people having a long Champions way and they have a menagerie with them they have goats and horses a horse a horse and a donkey and a dog as well and there must be almost two dozen people they are a group of normal-looking folks for the most part some of them are old maybe in their 70s or older and there's about five children that couldn't be older than eleven amongst them some women's men some of them are wearing clothes that would indicate that they were no more than peasants some of them are a little bit well well-dressed it's just a diverse group of people all of them are carrying a pack or satchel of some kind with sensibly some clothes and other supplies in them and there's one larger wagon that there that the pair of donkeys are pulling that have what looked to be several older or injured people on the back of it along with a few crates of supplies marching alongside them are a few armed individuals that are wearing black and white overcoats marked with like a red trim somewhere on them and they're carrying shields that have what looks the the interesting thing about this marking that they painted on their shields is that it's the same marking that is used by many denominations of the sacred fire an image of a just a burning flame but they have changed it to resemble a comic so there's a very pointed meteor in the center of the fire and then the tail kind of splits off into three different directions so it is reminiscent of the symbol that you've seen worn by the Silver order but instead it shows this permutation painted on the shield there they're carrying maces and the ones that have the the black white and red overcoats and armor and the shields have hair that looks like it was shaving off but then has since started to grow back there's about four or five like that both men and women and then alongside them you recognize the preacher is with them as well as is a much larger man also wearing the black white and red and he is carrying a great axe and though his hair he has hair that is very shaggy and worn it's blonde hair and it's grown out much longer than the others even though he's still wearing all these markings that the other warriors have do I remember the preachers name you seem to remember you calling yourself Shaffer Shaffer yes okay how far are we from them far let's say about 300 feet and they're moving the same direction that we're moving towards champions gate yeah you want to catch up with them yeah let's catch up blendin do a little job no it's up to Shaffer yeah we're gonna just he knows us run up so we start like jogging likely towards them and I'm waving mhm and one of the children says there's more coming as you as you approach and the the caravan stops and the larger man and the the other armed warriors step towards the rearguard of the caravan the the big man looks at you he's wearing hide armor and he's got a big white fur cloak they Stern over it that is both what looks like the the fur of a black wolf and a red wolf that he's dipped the edges of it in blood and he's wearing it over his shoulders brandishing his axe and he well he has very dark skin he has what these black roots that are coming in of his hair but the rest of his hair has been bleached blonde he's a massive man probably about six foot before and he growls at you as you approach and he says like be with you friends if you walk the path to peace with us you're welcome to follow us to salvation but the wrath of heaven will be upon you if you wish to rob us we have no interest in robbing you yeah we we are old friends of Shaffers and the preacher raises his hand he steps forward again that this got older man in his 60s also wearing the white and black robes carrying no weapons with him though and he holds kind of the this holy symbol that he's got around his neck and he says Harold these are the ones that saved us a few weeks ago before you were with us and he says peace and light upon you also you were we're still here we're hanging out how have you guys been been faring in Drakon home I see that you have more numbers you have better protection that's good good to see yes we are lucky our numbers have swelled in recent weeks more and more have heard the call the new dawn have you as well is that why you've come today we we've come today because they are exploring our religious options yeah I would say that that we have been guided here in a way we're trying it out I guess we're gonna see we were interested in yeah walking to you guys I don't close any doors yeah we want to know a little bit more about what your organization does do you have like an intro kind of pamphlet sort of like can we go in and like you say you give us the true or you say like here's what we're all about and we decide if the religion is right for us yeah I don't know if I should be saying that religion word you know I worry sometimes I don't want to say hi see how you're doing see if you get you know obviously you didn't robbed a bit more so you know want to make sure that you guys were doing all right I tried shaving my head it wasn't the best look on me so I started to grow it back but you know it's it's pretty cool be steps baby steps Harold turns to Schaefer says they do not know which path they wish to walk will you let them walk amongst us to the gates and Schaefer nods you come with us the rest of the way I will tell you of our purpose here it is a blessed one we mean you no harm where we're there are monsters and thieves all around Drakon hymen so far you guys seem very kind indeed the path ahead is dangerous and we would appreciate your company we are after all modest people and you can see that humongous are warriors he points to the group assembled says we have sick we have tired you young and old we've all come to bask in a new light consider us temporary reinforcements to get you there safely do you need help with your sick they will be tended to in time we have helped them this far our souls are armored by light and faith is our shield and it is true we must protect and love the sick and the meek for they show us the humble virtue by which we may light the brightest Souls such a way with words sit away with ya sounds sounds good cool cool cool cool cool cool yeah we're along for the ride we'll hopefully hopefully nothing goes wrong but if it does you can count on us just consider us you know bodyguards or like heroes if you want theirs we don't lightly even it's not far now these folk have come a long way those have come from Sky they from Illyria those from caspia those from other parts of West Tamar they have all heard our New Testament the word is spread and he goes over to one of his packs sit beside the horse and he opens up a small pack and produces a very small manuscript he says may have us and it says on the front of it written in common the testament of the falling fire a little bit of light reading how thick is it it's about an inch and a half thick and when you open it up that it's like eight point font of like passages that have all been numbered and and written and so several pages are illuminated and by illuminated I mean that just drawings in them oh good that'll that'll ease up on the page count yeah I like when these pictures I'm still working through my mother's book here there's this yeah well oh it's next thank you it's next on my reading list the only thing that strikes out is that as you flip the first page it says once again on the the testament of the falling fire as revealed to Lucretia Mathias Krisha Mathias who's that I recognized the name as the why do I recognize that name Schafer ah she is our leader Lucretia Mathias it was her that predicted the falling star Oh was it was and it was her maybe not sacred fire revealed the new truth to her the others in holy Illyria did not believe her and she was excommunicated and banished for what they called heresy but hers is a new truth a new way that will light the way the path to the Age of Heroes did she how did she come to know about the falling fire did she see it in a vision all was written it came to her revealed to her in dreams and visions as the flame and the fire that guards our world the flame and the fire of our souls themselves told her the truth of what is to come guys I need to talk to her you should read the book skip to the end see what happens at the end read the last page and then Pluto is uh yeah that's that's interesting I'd very much like to to speak to her does she speak to two people coming in she does she sees all who seek refuge at st. Salinas all right lead the way will uh will protect you the way there will you join our cause will you swear to the it is not a requirement or can we like can we can we his crews over the book a little bit and just kind I'd like to yeah I would like to read the book I want to commit to anything too big this sounds like a lot of uh I understand extra hmm can take time for the weight of the truth to sink in wanted once has been revealed I myself didn't believe it for years and years I didn't think that it could be true but I know now in my heart that that was folly once I came to this city and saw what had happened here and once I felt the light in my heart it is truly miraculous he borders on like crazy but also everything he says is awesome and really speaks to me yeah you seem like a very good man and I look forward to finding out a little bit more about your system beliefs your cause good word yeah cause it is not long before you come right to champions gate the gate is a dilapidated ruin most of the Grand towers here are collapsed the great statues that stood flanking either side of Champions Gate no more than blasted ruins in fact the whole middle section of Champions Gate has collapsed and the gate itself is just a pile of rubble and surrounding it the what remains of the intact tower is a small shantytown surrounded by a palace a a rubble that the followers of the Fallen fire have created here are several tents in the midst of the haze where these people are sheltering themselves and exposing themselves directly to the haze as you as you can tell there's nothing here that would protect them from the amount of exposure here and indeed you can see in many of the people that they're getting sick that many of the people that are here are not doing well oddly enough though those with shaven heads or the evidence that's just that their heads were recently shaved appear to be Hale and healthy like including Schaffer yes because we know Schafer's been ferrying people so I assume that he's been and like he's not sure he's gone but looking at him now he doesn't show the signs of the sickness that you would expect from someone who'd been exposed to the haze continuing their people alive in here you live you live here and they're not even two back see no no he says this is the last respite before the hardest leg of the journey and he points over the palisade he says the path ahead is the most dangerous of all and not all can make it we go in smaller groups toward st. Selina's but the area around the crater where the sacred fire landed is dangerous and it tests every soul that dares to walk toward st. Salinas do you still have some of that uh orange stuff o X ha quacks bhurji oh yeah do we still have wait I think we have no we gave it all the way wait one for testing and then one per one for our needs we're talking about the heart needle right hmm now I can see that these people here camping are being tested they're looking a bit green around the gills how are the rest of the followers who seem to have a little bit shorter haircuts doing so well he turns to Harold I'm preserved by my faith and I bear that mark and blessing so your faith keeps you alive in the haze yeah taking anything no extra novelty pills I've I like is there any magic involved make a persuasion check persuade so that's a 28 he grabs the top of his cloak he starts to pull it back super serrated and he says the uninitiated or not yet protected but he pulls down and there is a shard of delirium jammed into his heart and you can see that it is rated that the it is radiating out amongst his flesh and that he has carved the symbol that the piece of delirium around his heart see around his flesh then has been carved this symbol of the meteor and he says this blessed charcoal you might know as delirium it is the vessel of the sacred fire we protect it and hold it close to our hearts so they're actually super sick like they're beyond they are jamming delirium into their hearts I've kind of done that no you jammed anti delirium into your heart yeah I did and it made you poop a lot I ruined my argument is there anyone who's beneficiated into this that hasn't seen me amazing effects of your initiation the uninitiated are not as protected as such we do what we can to shelter them the way forward but not all survived the journey to st. silliness anybody who looks like me amongst just know let's go say that would be a really weird shaven to vacci guys they're like some sort of secret here about if we jam delirium into our hearts were immune to the haze well my next questions gonna be do you know of a man named Oscar yarn I do not know that name no has anyone arrived recently amongst your group like us outcasts to the falling fire that have immersed themselves within your hair outlast many of us are out guests many of us are downtrodden weak hopeless but we have found hope a new purpose we do not ask of people's pasts here we only ask that they serve for a new dawn my apology am I able to minor illusion an image of Oscar yarn yeah can I like so I hold out my hand and I make a little Oscar yarn up here have you seen this man no can't say I recognize him cool what about Jupiter Jones can you do Jupiter Jones have you seen this man in neighborhood village yes he's an idiot you are correct fair he's good this guy's good yeah so the haze is bad that way and I point towards the crater but what about um yes thankfully hose you said there's something where you have to travel to San Salinas and there's phase mmm st. Salinas has become our sanctuary from there we could observe where the falling fire has landed and go out and collect the charcoal there are all the faithful have gathered for what is to come next what's what's that Lucretia Mathias has not yet revealed that to us boy and she's at Saint Salinas yes I guess that's where we're going that that is the opposite direction from the crater yes if you pull up your map you can see that once you go through champions gate you would go north to get to the great crater but then you would go Southwest to get to st. Salinas so seemingly it would actually be less affected by the haze over there possibly it's on the river it was so close to the crater well I know but I'd rather be heading towards better haze situation than towards worse a situation further away from the Great Creator than the clock tower is but the clock tower is also much taller and across the river well guys if we initiate you might become super-powered look for me yeah I don't are you talking about joining I mean I don't like you you just gave this big speech about like how we need to get rid of a haze and stuff what are we gonna do walking around dragon hime with shards of delirium in our hearts when this is all said and done you're absolutely right I remember what happened it's just that I just want to just making sure can I watch an initiation like I kind of want to just see it go down I also want to know like you know the post lifespan also this whole thing about her like this seems like her version of drinking the kool-aid like like just keep jamming delirium in your heart and then I'll tell you what's gonna happen next like I thought that kind of freaks me out but I'm also still a little injury we're intrigued for injury we would like to go to st. Salinas with you and we would like to talk Krisha a pilgrimage maybe we can join one builder mention just see what it's like to the asylum I mean it to the crater oh I'm their bodyguard I'll make sure they are old says where are these carrier unconscious bodies back he looks you over and say my purpose is to protect the meek in the innocent on their journey towards Saint Salinas you are neither but our general job is to protect the meek in the innocent in any sense yeah maybe we can help if you would go beyond these gates you go on your own I hope you find your true strength and faith a whit and Steel will not preserve you there but you do not believe now by the time you arrive at the gates of the Saint Salinas you will know we're going in the same direction apparently many of these folks have journeyed for some time I will lead the next group in the morning you are welcome to wait if you wish to join them then the dawn of time yeah we are how many days out from the meeting with the Lord Commander are we to two so yeah we wanted to yeah join a token inch but yeah I'm just gonna go I guess I always come back okay yeah I guess our goal is to talk to Lucretia yeah maybe we can take some stragglers with us and make sure they get there maybe we can help Oh cuz the most dangerous part of the journey we want extra people with us right given the option I wanna I wanted to have a helpful moment okay we can help I mean okay what I really wanted to just like I want to like gather some of the young kids up and give all that gold that I stole from those people and then I want to ruffle one of their heads over there as you offer the gold to one of the children they they look at that and one of the child's parents takes it and says most of us have sold all of our worldly possessions to come here we have little left and she takes the gold and she brings it towards Schaffer who takes it and he says it is appreciated we have little others sell the sacred stones for profit to practice we have we would not see the instruments of salvation used for such frivolous purpose never we only have Ritalin only what we can bring that's just blasphemous I mean I would trade it for food does that make sense it is worse there is worse things I have heard I've seen it Katya spoken of it to the others of our of the old faith the old beliefs dogs in the silver order they destroy the stones they break them that is why they're here that's why they're here yes what more do you know about that yeah we didn't see that they they do not believe it they do not believe that these are salvation they will display what sooner to destroy it and deny salvation to all and face the truth their hypocrisy makes my blood boil it's cool yeah sometimes I get hypocritical too I just gave a big speech and then I'm not another one of the protectors with them says I didn't believe it till I saw it with my own eyes but they can they've been teaching the flame keepers and the paladin's what to do they know they have found a blasphemous way to destroy the stones how I know not it's blasphemy it is a denial of truth it is grave sin so we have one group who can destroy the stone we have one group who wants to use it for years true well this opens up possibilities because if the civil order knows how to blow it up maybe if they blew up the meteor we could just destroy the base yeah flip side don't you say that out loud you're like you're like mumbling telling a child I think that you know there's so much potential with what the Delirium the charcoal can give no so safer it has but one true purpose it is the vessel for the flame the instrument of our salvation and all else is blasphemy it is to corrupt the very heart and soul of our world we have seen and heard of the other things that people have done it is to corrupt the very essence of life it is mockery yeah agreed seen some of that bad stuff and did not agree at least they hate Oscar - damn the man we're actually searching for someone who dabbles with blasphemy yeah last Harold speaks up bet he's a mage isn't he Thor the worst I've seen them drinking it it sickens me it's horrible so bad so bad for you it can't be good for you ya know like you drink that stuff I mean you might go bald and your eyes might start glowing but like not because you shaved your head I mean just really any anyway I'm getting very I'm getting off topic yes it is worse it is like drinking one soul the corruption it brings upon you it is true evil can I see the book when was it written does it have one of those it doesn't you have heard of this sting spreading and it's been around for several years and the word of this has has gone around but the truth of what they're doing coming here is you have to read the book yes sir Schaffer still around right yeah so I walk up to him and I just say so with all of this going on we've we've been a help to you I hope a little bit is there anything that you can offer us to help us get to Saint Salinas I know you said it's a very dangerous is there any like even advice is what should we be watching out for are we talking the haze or are we talking monsters beyond our the lost and the damned those who in the moments when the flame fell were judged in found wanting [Music] okay so there are physical manifestations manifestations that we will have to deal with yes okay question about the charcoal have you heard of it not working on certain types of people immunities or you know even if they do believe it just not not helping them I feel so bad for any who would have such a awful spiritual affliction I don't know if it's spiritual flexion or just like physical maybe their blood or something those unaffected by it there are those who have embraced it such as ourselves but those who deny it in their hearts of hearts then walk amongst it as monsters do they are damned I like to think they could also be like maybe the faith is already with them or not or totally not the way you're looking at me you know why we should profess it we should should should we go we should go yeah I think we need more information from Krisha high knowledge this yeah thank you so much for getting us here I guess we're gonna make our own little pilgrimage over to Saint Salinas we're gonna go this way I start to like walk backwards a little bit they like have like a farewell they said may the light might be with you like you might be with you might be with you okay over the casual see you later light so are you going to head over the ruined ramparts of the city walls and into the southward oh yeah towards Saint Salinas we have an audience with another leader probably just gonna show up yeah I guess that's that's kind of our the last thing on our checklist of factions to check in on is to talk to her and kind of see men team huddle huddle we'll see what happens after the break before we continue with the second half of our session tonight we've got a few

ruins you step over the rubble of Champions gates and from the low mound of the rise of the ruins of this once majestic city gate you survey the Ground Zero of the devastation of trackanon have any of you ever been this close to the crater before skirted around the edges but I've never actually gone over the wall here you can see before you mostly fog and ruin all buildings here are blasted and ruined in some way all radiating outward from the center the epicenter of the explosion as you turn and look at the remains of the wall of Champions Gate the other side the inside of the wall is glass it shines like crystal this kind of rough glass but it's not charred the bricks and stones on the inside of the wall just as they break it's like there's a clean there's the break where things were sent flying away but the layer of brick on the inside that would have taken the blast head-on base what wasn't blown off those bricks have all become solid pieces of glass this isn't the first time we've seen this phenomenon that's so cool remember the rat's nest yeah I am i close enough to like reach out and touch the wall mm-hmm it just feels like glass yeah and in looking at it it's like the entire stone block that you're looking at was turned into a piece of glass like it goes all the way through that one brick and then you can see the mortar behind it of the wall that is not glass so cool the house was built out of those a see-through house like I mean no privacy but like super pretty which evens the remnants of some of the few buildings around here are the same the face of the building that is directly facing the crater just that first bit of it it's just in parts art glass scary what might happen to a lot of things around here when that came down how many people returned to glass I start surveying the area to see if there's any glass people around you look around and the visibility is very poor even though that there is a breeze there was a light wind heading into the city that wind has basically died once you've come over the remnants of the wall from it from the crater you can feel there's a bit of a turning in the air that's brushing away from the crater against your face but the fog here and the thickness of the haze has limited visibility and in fact you are exposing yourself to the full impact of the haze now just as not dissimilar to the haze around around the mage tower I tie a bandana round my face knowing that it's not going to do much a little bit of a filter [Laughter] you can you hear a voice call out from its its Schaefer says we've set torches and lights along the way that marked the safest path you may take that if you wish Larry oh that was easy thanks Schaeffer thanks light be with you what's the UM the light you see there's fog but is it darker it is not dark the sunlight does shine through the fog but ultimately your visibility is limited to about 100 150 feet at most so we're we're gonna have to be pretty diligent about listening because we can only see so far so if anything that's gonna come at us we can only see 100 hundred 50 feet so we're gonna have to ears open can you walk without clunking you know I can't and I hate when you ask me those loaded questions okay I mean if he was small like like it's not you know you know my name if he was small I could carry him okay guys I'll be the distraction if anything I'll just make myself a little louder and I'm gonna pull out my drift globe I'm gonna turn it on I'm just gonna have it hover just a little bit in front of me there's really add noise well it's kinda like it's it's visual noise you know I'm like now I'm like a lighthouse and I'm just gonna be oh and then you guys hide in the darkness and you come save me when I start we're gonna walk like 20 paces behind you okay no no he can do that we're gonna walk 20 paces behind him and we're gonna be quiet so that if he gets attacked we get the drop on whatever attacks him as long as well they can still see a hundred feet probably will be will be on the sidelines will be what do you want we can walk 20 paces away but maybe Pluto try your best the clink-clink rather than closer okay I'm gonna click and I'm broke I clink clink okay I never stop my bar corner so you're gonna proceed forward with stealth so slowly but with stealth or a normal pace or quickly normal pace but normal pace but okay being trying to be aware of yeah I'm I'm so perceptive I used my shield as like my third eye thank super I scan so as you travel forward into and you're heading towards st. sling and we're following a tour chuckle yeah alrighty you can all roll me one D six five six three okay I'm never gonna read it I don't wanna good numbers as you head forward you begin walking from one torch to the next and heading through the blasted ruins of city streets and at one point you pass by a building looks like it used to be an old Ford your blacksmith shop and the whole building has been completely disassembled and each individual part timber and brick is floating in space about six inches away from the other building that it was a part of the building it was supposed to be attached to including the parts of the people that were in it guys it's getting weird it's getting real weird in here are they preserved as all the other bodies are this is yeah you call it preserve because the heart's still beating and the person there is kind of just like you get the the tongue is floating six inches out from the esophagus and it's smacking itself and the jaw is chattering but all the teeth have been separated and are floating around it the heart is still beating the lungs are still pulsing this kind of reminds me of what the with this academy tower is doing except with eight-person people except in people form which makes it like I'm gonna say like 62% more concerning mmm-hmm what if we stab the heart with delirium because then it's like the faith we're doing the faith walk but this person needs to find the life the the heart of the the person is floating about 15 feet in the air yeah yeah do you want to jump up and stab that with a piece of delirium if I'm going to grab the heart I'm probably gonna turn it more into like a meat apple have a snack on the way I was just maybe this is what happens people get freaked out and then they start just doing whatever the the light told them to I say we leave the for now no I don't want to tell ya guys I'm just brainstorming there's no bad idea will come back if we figure out the solarium thing and put them back together we can always stab the heart later I'm sure it's still gonna be there I say we move on quietly yeah you continue to move from torchlight 2 torchlight each sconce that has been placed in the distance is a spear that has been driven into the ground and a Scot a torch sconce or a lantern has been hung off of the sconce they are spaced far enough that you come you approach the neck as you get to the next one the next one is just at the edge of your vision in the fog so they're each only about 150 feet apart and Vail as you travel you have a pretty good sense of direction and a pretty good sense of distance and none of this is making any sense you've traveled for about an hour now and you would have expected to be at st. Selena's play now it's taking way longer than it should there's no way that the amount of distance from here to st. Selena's is taking this long and we're not there already have you noticed us like taking any turns or she's been following the torches yeah there are the torches like weaving unless they were wanting to like can give me a perception check they have 21 slightly twisting and turning and but no and the way you think about it like they might have twisted a turn but no more than the way the wall itself would have but it's very difficult to think about that and thinking back at no point did you ever make like a sharp 90-degree turn from one torch to the next they twisted slightly each time but your path does your bearing has been pretty straight forward relatively we've been going in generally the same direction other than a few turns here or there but nothing that's sharp enough to draw us out in a direction that would make it still take this long so we're wandering aimlessly through haze and we're not where we're supposed to be by now but we're heading in the right direction from what I can tell yeah magic is taking its toll and all like are we noticing the indeed we can all make Constitution saving throws and why did I say that I mean I feel great 20:23 Sebastian nine-nine Sebastian the haze is beginning to get to you and you suffer from one level of exhaustion yeah I do you should stab yourself in the heart with a Guyot with a book told me do you believe like you're you're into this more than you are at the beginning yeah I have you read the book what on the walk no it's very hazy I'm like really at like heightened awareness right now I'm trying to be I'm not reading the book right now I'm just not disadvantaged on ability check well they oh I mean you're our navigator I know this is all foreign territory but what do you think do we press on do we maybe try to find a landmark that makes more sense to you um yeah I'm worried of traveling off the path because this is obviously how they they get there I'm just wondering how much further we can go without suffering from the haze is this another puzzle no let's just push on guys it's got to be like we can only see 150 feet it's probably like right after the next torch as we go on I'd like to take stock of the other buildings because I've been here as a child I knew the area quite well but I'm just trying to see if there's any familiar landmarks other than seeing Salinas that would point me in the right direction absolutely you can give me a give me an investigation check 14 13 you can see this area used to be all warehouses for the most part Stock Yards warehouses things that serve the the industrial area of the city and you have memories of chasing around with Sebastian for many many years but many of the buildings here are long gone blast it away or turn to glass but you recall from where you are the street that you are on um it's an old street called post street remember it because there was this big warehouse that was full of paper on it you can see the remnants of that paper warehouse because all the pay that the roof has been blown off the walls are falling down but there's all those stacks of crates that you set paper in them but they're all solid stone from here well from here if that's the warehouse then the next torch is the opposite direction you should be going we seem to be going the wrong way how's that possible come on magic right okay can I like is there magic afoot here I wanna like am I able to like try to hone in on the any magical presence that's going on here idea the detect magic spell now I have our canna I'm proficient in it it's very apparent that there's some kind of magic happening but what it is without further or spells or detection be impossible to determine we could check out some of these buildings maybe paper to stone building sure wait rock paper we attack it with scissors I figured out your puzzles you can all roll me a d6 oh this is cuz I solved a puzzle right three three five okay we're time passes spend about another hour we would still buy this paper mill it's a paper warehouse not a warehouse not a milk we're still like as as we've moved from no it's been an hour since the last late though an hours passed now that's where you are that's where Bao's kind of figured out you're you're at now guys this might sound crazy but what if we turn around and start heading the other way cuz it seems that that's the right direction yeah maybe some sort of magic is like I don't know maybe there's a trick here maybe there's like maybe if we had it in the opposite direction we end up where we're supposed to go this is I asked him for clues and he said there was physical manifestations I was ready for combat and and now I'm stuck in a hazy wilderness of horrors to make I using do we have any delirium I yes can I have a piece of delirium to jam it into my heart I I don't know yet if you do I'm gonna be really upset I won't really upset I would ask for your consent before I jammed piece of delirium in your heart thank you okay yeah you're welcome if rather than going based on the yes all the delirium I do have all those I have a piece of delirium as I'm taking it out I'm thinking I have a piece of Mike cloth what if we go based on directions based on what I remember rather than the torches your hope you're not having that in your bare hand I haven't my glove hand okay because did you pull out the Delirium the two of you in each role one day 20 2017 okay you pull the Delirium out you hear a low cry coming from the building across the way they could think that there was a good guy what kind of cry sounded like a woman's tears quite a scream almost I mean the last boulders and as you pull the Delirium out it begins to glow I want to do one of those like yeah I want to do it does it change glow there's a glow like stronger or weaker it seems to be reflecting light in various ways almost a visit if it's catching all of the light from different directions but there's too much light like it's just catching the ambient light that's pulling it in and sending it out in all all different ways there's nothing focus there's no focus light source that is helping it glow it's just emitting that glow off the top you guys heard that cry right I want to hold it really close to my heart okay you bring it close to your heart there's a beam that comes forward almost like as the closer it is to your heart it's pointing the way and it points the way again in the opposite direction of the torches this way okay this way my friends what about take another piece out well I ignore that crying this this crazy whether I take another piece out and I put it towards my heart I don't want to see if it does the same thing it does you're not you're not the what did he call you you use that really bad word yeah like where you were like even yeah I put the other piece of delirium back in my bags I'm like as long as we have one out let's follow that let's not go towards the cry though I'm gonna follow my heart well what if somebody needs help they probably are trying to lure you into a trap like last time and we're pretty noted we fall for those we doom should we just go into the trap yeah because we do it often your beam that comes from your heart is leaving you in a different direction from oh yeah anybody got a spare pair of gloves I just want to check something use your Meech and use your median I'm going to cast mage hand and take a small piece of delirium and hover it near my hearts another being emits from your heart all of them are point away from the torch that's in the distance but in three different directions well I have a theory and it's scaring me a lot and I think I'm on the theme yeah what we all have to take our own way it's a we have to follow our heart I don't want to open can we just I just yell pork chops I've never have never been more scared than this moment right now not even facing a t-rex was as scary as being alone in the delirium haze without you guys what do you guys think oh yeah huddle good my instinct is saying what if it's the only way don't what if it's the only way what if my instinct is to survive and not to find you can all make a constitution saving from our indecision Sebastian 1124 there you suffer one level of exhaustion Sebastian you do not Ludo you're fine you can all roll me at d6 as well please 4-4-2 okay you can hear some footsteps coming shuffling from the building across the way guys we need to go track and force I know it sounds crazy but I feel like we have to follow our heart that we do it there's footsteps coming our way so either we're going to like scatter in three different directions or we're gonna turn and face whatever is walking up behind us and then scatter in three different directions which is it I need to decide right now Dadar okay take a delirium I pointed to my heart I follow the beam I follow my beam I follow my beam okay roll for initiative as we just scattered we just split the party well I just threw my dice I'll take it I rolled two ones my advantage gave me nothing with advantage that's sad bandage it's okay that means that all the ones are gone from this dice you can only roll quick have we ever made a smart choice in this entire campaign yeah you tell us twitch have they so what we got 14 1919 2 and 2 2 1 plus 1 is 2 1 plus 1 is 2 that's everything looking over there I'm not laughing I'll repeat pardon I know I'm good yep just refresh it yep thanks Kyle okay we love you give people a few minutes to rejoin as well as I get our initiative going now how far do we make it away from each other everything's good like are we still standing beside each other holding little crystals to our hearts or did we run we'll have that opportunity on your first turn to decide what you want Oh like we yelled scatter but I think that we like took three steps before things went sideways Naoto yeah and 20 steps and are we located to go an extra 15 minutes over our time everyone's ok tonight early morning yeah okay yep so we're gonna we're gonna keep at it for a little bit longer and keep going from there so yeah I think who knows we'll cut this out of the final broadcast but ok so we rolled for initiative we're back in action here we are you are standing in the midst of the deep haze in the wake of the crater the Delirium glowing from your heart and pointing all in different directions as there's a shrill cry coming from one of the buildings across the way and several footsteps rushing forward Sebastian what do you do I can't see and like I just hear the footsteps I can't see you see coming up from the edge of the mist there is a strange shambling form it looks like a emaciated person and as they stumble forward you can see that parts of their body as they raise them up hourglass and as at the points where there the glass and their flesh collide so thus forms this man he turns around and you can see that there are several spikes in his back pieces of the meteor and delirium that have impaled him in several places and a few more of these forms are stepping forward out of the Mist man I wish I hadn't asked about glass people yeah you you have brought ominous tidings are they like grouped together looking around there are six forms shuffling forward all from different directions are you surrounded I so I'm standing there surrounded by haze looking as these six forms that I can barely see just at the edge of my vision yeah are coming towards me they almost look like they're stepping out of the haze as the parts of their body or that are made of glass make them blend in with the rest of the haze and the rest of their form is almost crops like in its power I am going to use to sorcery points to cast darkness so I hold up my fingers and I snap the lights out and darkness just pours out of me surrounding me okay anything else that you'd like to do um I'm going to are Vail and Pluto still near me yeah they're still right because we yelled scatter and then we were surrounded yeah I'm going to back up like at like towards them so that we're like shoulder to shoulder place yourselves on the middle than that so you guys are in darkness to now unfortunately but I mean I feel like this is my best protection if you guys want to leave the darkness that's that's up to you but I'm I was born I was born I was at a hospital it was a hospital that I was born i Caspian Church so everything's dark sebastian makes darkness emanate from all around him and you're in the midst of this ruin street cool Dale you're up I cast Zephyr strike and I start to move out of the darkness towards this this lady zombie okay and what I want to do is also cast my feline agility mm-hmm and I want to get around her and I want to kind of get up on the top of this kind of structure so that way I can get a higher vantage point okay I kind of crawl up as high as I can if I have to go around up the steps and then crawl if it's easier I can do that as well okay so you go completely around her and then up onto this the pile of rubble yeah behind you yep and then I take perching up on the top of this rock it's a good um I take out my longbow and I'm gonna take my three shots on this lady unbid okay using my first attack with advantage for my supper strike Riley 18 the shot rings out and there's the sound of metal hitting glass you hit alright I'm gonna take my extra Chad d8 for my zephyr strike as well and I will take my 58 from my dread ambusher as well ates damaged the glass that composes her body shatters and there is the twinkling sound is that he hits the stone ground and the few cobblestones that remain and a low thud as the wet remains of her body fall to the ground sorry a shot at the one across directly across from me okay 22 the blow lands squarely in the side of his face 19 it sends shards of glass and flesh flying away and the creature barely stands but his bloodied take one more shot at him mm-hmm but the second shot collides with the face and we can roll that damage but he's destroyed as once again a shower of glass and I stay on my perch at the top of this structure cool next up are the creatures Oh No yeah seemingly unfazed by it three of them walk towards Sebastian and it really only hinders me right now you're welcome two of them attacking pollute oh and one Sebastian they don't have advantage against Sebastian because he can see in the darkness uh and he gets a 12-2 hit Sebastian I'm gonna cast shield okay and the other two look one gets a 12-2 hit pair of sevens on with advantage and the other Wow gets a nine to hit against you aye-aye I have Hazard Lee deflect the blows it's fists come down in the shield and you can hear the sound of shattering glass as it hits your shield and like reverberates back through the glass of its body it's still holding itself together but you can see that there are flakes of glass that like fly around Unbounce off your armor as it is it smashes down on you Sebastian is the other one wanted to punch you you block it with the shield and it's the force of its blow collides against the the magic sending pieces of glass flying in various directions impressed cool pollute oh you're up oh I start Wilding couldn't see that Sebastian could it was cool but you couldn't see it I just your glass falling yeah yeah that looks so cool Wow and I'm just gonna start swinging my sword wildly getting a 20 that hits for 8 damage cool to the one that's that I felt I felt him and then a 15 15 yeah as your blade comes down it resounds in with the glass but doesn't crack it ooh okay and there was all disadvantage right yeah and then I'm gonna slam the thing that I think is there with the shield okay and push it away athletics yeah 21 I get a seven so I'm just gonna thank skull-splitter dice lying okay knock it back five feet yeah okay anything else no okay we go to the top of the round with Sebastian all right um I'm sorry that I put you in this situation Pluto I'll try to take care of it I'm gonna cast a scorching Ray okay yeah and the one that he just knocked back I'm going to attack first okay do I get advantage no these creatures have blind sights of course they do well why not you knew it in fact looking upon them none of them have eyes yeah in fact in most cases the sockets you can see now this close their eye sockets themselves are empty and just like that's where the most of the glass is concentrated around as if they saw some great explosion and it blew their eyes away which they did good so then technically I have disadvantage because there's one attacking me that would be true yes do you still wish to do this [Music] I'm going to I'm gonna try to get away from this guy so I'm actually going to back up promote the opportunity attack and hopefully not that hit damn it is a wild opportunist and it gets a 18 to hit okay you take 17 points of slashing damage as shards of glass rip across your side as you go to escape and I need you to make a constitution saving throw I get an 8 okay where the wound dug into your flesh does not cauterize or bleed but you can feel the flesh turning into glass oh no you are restrained and you have not moved away and I also have to roll about my conversation I was like trying to crawl away from this guy and it's gone very poorly and here's my concentration check 18 so I maintain concentration on darkness but I'm just hanging out there you still have your action you are restrained so I imagined that Sebastian starts to like clamour away gets scraped along the back and kind of like just slumps there screaming many turns and you know what I'm yeah I'm gonna try to basically it reaches forward and as it does so it grasps at you and it's the almost like the its impale dyou and held you in place with the glass and like the glass is starting to fuse into the wound oh can I take a swing at it first no yes you can with this advantage well I I reach I reach out and I grab Pluto and I'm like I need out of here I swing and I'm like I don't know what's happening and I Thunder step both of us yeah okay that's gonna be hitting three of them to all three failure Constitution saving throws roll damage uh-oh and they're glassy right all right so glancing after taking that brutal hit I immediately want out of there but I don't want to go anywhere don't be a glass hole you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna empower this spell okay were you roll two of those days there we go ten 15 23 there is a crack of thunder and the it is the sound of breaking windows like they base as the as the air is sucked in as you teleport with a thunder step and the resounding shock wave goes out and you just see all of them crack and then the glass just flies out in different directions as it just shatters and breaks and flies you know it's drawing all three of them whoo and I reappear and Pluto just hears me like screaming in pain but you can't see me nope no idea where shard of glass is still impaled in in use you're fine we got a van fine so I'm still yeah at the top here kind of taking a look I see the darkness like disappear and like loud crack of thunder and I see this zombie glass guy coming towards me and I'm like nope and I take two shots at him okay 19 that hits 17 damage nice shot 17 to hit that hits as well Wow it's a hot dice where were those last week two shots resound out shattering it to a million pieces I count the million feet I wait why am i concentrating I think no one knows why he's conjugated a darkness it's not helping anyone but it's only hurting me Sebastian feels like it's protecting him they're destroying oh yeah got him okay I'm confused cuz I was standing over there a minute ago you have a glass in you right to inspect where his arm is class okay make a medicine check 21 yo but but I kind of pull the shard of glass out and as you do did you pull the piece of glass out there's like this ripping sort of Sh Larkin breaking sound as the bits of his flesh around the wound that we're turning to glass are pulled out with the shard of glass Sebastian you take another ten points of damage but you are no longer restrained and turning into glass potion I need a nap I'm the only medical official around here and you're fine you'll be fine okay doc I have a grater and I have a potion of greater healing you know I might use my potion really I'm gonna I also have the thumbs augment oh yeah what is that I'll use it out it's like there's one left in it how much does that give me now that also cures poison disease alright I'll just drink my potion I I leaned up against some rubble and I lay there and sip on my potion I'm actually gonna be busy I want to go I want to go click delirium Mayo we should collect the delirium from their backs and stuff good idea is any of it salvageable much of the ones that were hit but much of them are there are in total when we already have blasphemy on us for selling it so it's like might as well just commit we're gonna if you finish your potion you'll be fine do you want some illyrian liquor to like go with that potion so you managed to salvage together two more low there are two large chips of delirium that are worth fifty gold people but you could probably get fifty gold pieces on this for you and 1d6 1d6 three fragments they're probably worth about a hundred gold pieces each the chips each weigh a pound and the larger fragments each weigh two pounds two large and then two chips and three fragments my my I already had five a lustrous colored chips and let's make let's make necklace those chips fragment shards crystals yes our heart so you're sure that's okay they can't touch your skin put a little bit seven chips hm cool yeah thanks know you could probably gather up some more like bits of dust and smaller pieces but most of that was been scattered around yeah I'd say let's not spend too much more time in this let's follow our our heart light since for lower hurts I want to make like a makeshift necklace to hold the so hold the piece of delirium kind of like okay where my chest yeah yeah you can just so it makes it easier so I can stab things while I follow my heart so we're still we're still gonna split up are they still pointing different ways yep okay that's following it was my idea Sebastian Baio know that I watch over you but you won't be able to see it I won't be able to see you at all or hear you okay guys especially if you're in darkness anybody if you if something goes wrong you keep yelling pork chops so that we can pinpoint you oh yeah do not stop like an alarm like an alarm system that hasn't been turned on but don't say words until we get there cuz you also want to be sneaky okay I was linked I'd clink clink oh I'm so nervous about this I start clinking towards my my target Oh Pluto's gone I start sneaking away quietly oh okay hey I was going I'm I'm standing alone here talking to myself all right I'm gonna head in this direction all right you had in the different directions of your own respective heart lights off the path until listen until the light from each other's lights cannot be seen nor from the torches you each walk along an empty street and you can't roll a d20 this is the worst idea we've ever had we've had worse I rolled the ten I rolled a 9 I rolled a seven okay I don't know what they mean I can't get a read them you walk along the street empty and alone and you can see the shadows of the Dead their silhouettes the blast against the buildings the low rumble of rock and here and there the odd floating piece of masonry going by continue walking forward Sebastian as you walk along the path you hear a voice just saying why why why do I recognize the voice what does it sound like to you my father sure you mean it way creepier than it had to be you could have just dad dad oh god no why would he be here that don't don't yell that ouch just keep just keep walking I'm just gonna keep walking I'm just focusing on one walking laid out as you walk along you can see in the street ahead of you there's a body laying on the on the ground the ground it had his glass the end as you walk past it the face looks up at you and smiles and looks at you and it says the man is fused into the ground with glass yes please help me oh and as you look down at him another voice sounds out a woman's voice no help me please I've been here so long and turn around on one of the walls similarly fused in the glass and with a shard of delirium growing out of her head is another common folk woman yeah I tend like my helmet is muffling I can't hear them I'm just gonna kind of just keep clinking a lot like I know you continue walking along passing on more people some of which are old their faces fuse together into buildings one a straggling mass of a man that is fused to a glass horse don't keep the horse oh I was actually thinking to like it and you continue walking forward uh yeah I mean it's kind of freaking me out I do like the little tiptoe run when I get when something like is getting closer to me or if I have to get like past it and I try not to think about it and look back I just try to keep going forward okay you can all make one last Constitution saving throw 21 15 22 Oh way do we do disciplined you're all good there is you walk for what feels like another hour alone before in front of you are the walls of st. Salinas as the three of you step out from the haze to a large building the large towers of saint salinas before you how far like do I notice them how far from each other are we oh my god guys guys I've never been happier to see you in my whole life I mean I was pretty empty to be honestly didn't hear any voices yeah did you hear a voice I saw so many glass people one of them was like fused into the wall and another one was like help me and I was like I don't think I can watch I didn't say anything I pretended like they weren't there like most class people I would also oh gosh that's Idris a guy that was part horse he was like a centaur but like you it was more of like if a horse and a person we're put together like a centaur yeah but like not like a centaur maybe he can help us the horse person if you glued someone to the horse yeah and you just mash them together I just heard my dad did anybody else hear my dad I think you guys shouldn't touch the Delirium anymore positive at me yeah you can have my delirium necklace I don't want any egg and as you reach for them you a voice says little shards have lit your way forward with glowing hearts keep them closed standing before you is a flaxen-haired woman with sharp features and expressions she looks at you with piercing eyes she has a golden circlet holding up her long straight hair for a thin face she is very simply adorned in penitent robes and though underneath the robes you can see the octarine glow from her breast where her heart would would be clear sign that she too has one of these pieces of delirium in her she says you found your own path and your own truth those lights that others have walked you knew not to follow that old light of the inner light your own soul this is the path of the falling fire this is how we will see a new age welcome are you ready for the next steps I'm ready for some steps some answers maybe some food what who are you I am Lucretia Matthias I've heard of you um he's a big fan he actually has your book can we get it autograph I would hope that you've come for more than that I I have we have a lot in common you and I really I think so you've come here just to talk with me that's correct you've not come in true faith have you we've come in US form of faith I believe that what you're doing is incredible work I believe that you might be on to something and we're here on behalf of Drakon Heim and the betterment of Drakon Heim and I'm very interested in what you guys are doing because I think that you may have a large part to play in the betterment of Drakon Heim and I myself you are wrong oh we care not for the betterment dragon Heim our goals are not so humble perhaps we are here for the soul of our people of all mortals and to find out on what side of the next age we will all be on these concerns of this city of this place it is but the threshold for a new age we need not worry about the fate of the city of what import is that for the fate of all our souls but I think what you should be worried about is people who have come to disrupt the fallen star yes we will protect it how'll you protect it with so mica people though we're here to learn about that I'd like to I would like to learn from you if that's an option we will protect it guided through faith and lit with the Sword of Truth Lucretia fifteen years ago I had visions of the falling fire I don't know what these mean but I've heard that you had similar visions she takes your hand holds it tight and she says you're not alone there are many others who knew long before they are here we are all waiting for you to join us there is fraternity family and faith in the dawn of a new age together here we have all seen the same thing but do you know what it means a new age is upon us a great Age of Heroes and light are you ready yes then come and we will take this shard and we will drive it into your hearts so that your light may shine I prefer to leave my body on stab thank you Sebastian's in awe in this moment nobody's ever offered in this before he doesn't answer are you ready oh no it's fashion I don't think we're any of us are ready to be stabbed with delirium it's mmm there's something people like me m'lady there's other people who stab themselves a delirium but then they end up crazy I don't know if you've encountered people like us before but our hesitation doesn't come from a lack of faith but maybe a maybe a lack of understanding I maybe with a little bit more through faith you will find understanding through faith we may see the way the truth and the light it guides our path what did you do before the meteor film I was a flame keeper like many others that are here I preached the good word of the sacred fire held it deeply in my heart tended to the souls of those in need until I saw the falling fire and it is a revelation of a new age to come the sins of this world will be washed away and reborn in something new and we must allow our light to truly shine who was your first disciple who is your first follower there were few in those early times but now there are many they have come here with me some have fallen and others have not who is your longest surviving follower [Music] there are others here if you would like to meet them you will when you're during your initiation coudl you said it was a good idea maybe to continue to drive the Delirium into our hearts maybe we could become super powerful I you are quoting me you are directly quoting me from only a few hours before this yes maybe it's like it's like I'm standing on the edge we're standing on the edge and I don't know if I'm ready to jump are you thinking are you forgetting about all the different delirium things that we come across in this city I think stabbing yourself in the heart with delirium is going to be do you know why I came to this city she'sa stab yourself in the heart off experimentation no it was to figure out why I had visions of a meteor hitting Drakon hime before a meteor hit dragon hime it was it was to find my purpose it was to reclaim my rights as being a hero somebody somebody who brought light for this world instead of instead of the darkness that I've caused it was please don't shave your head again what is your name my name is Sebastian Crowe Sebastian Crowe the brightest flames cast the darkest shadows you are touched by sorcery are you not yes in time you will know that your curse is a blessing I I start sebastian starts it starts like crying he like drops to his knees and he's he's just he's sobbing at her feet I go up to Sebastian and I grab both his shoulders digging in my claws and say snap out of it buddy this is the Hades talking I fight so hard okay and you're gonna continue to fight you just claim to be his friend and yet you lead him astray from Dustin I lead him to not dying by stabbing himself in the heart with delirium looks so bad I just I just and this is an easy way this year is that what's your name Lucretia Lucretia I offer nothing easy there is nothing easy to the path that we walk but it is one it'll cost much it cost everything but it is a cost of faith and blood that is worth being paid no that sounds like that demon we saw in your mom's mirror you wanted a lot for answers as well the Queen once saying yeah and the Queen wants a bunch of stuff for answers like everybody wants a big price but everything was so much but the demon had oddly enough these people have answers that that I that I need to know what do I do I what happens if we do not have the faith if you are not really wanting if there is darkness in your soul it will be purified and all will be revealed what if all that I have is darkness what if that's all of me what if there is nothing else can you purify that much darkness is not black coal used to light hot flames never thought of that and she's the one who's telling me this she's really swinging me I think Sebastian you you don't need delirium to lay those flames you already have those flames in you don't let her talking talk you into doing something that's gonna do more harm than good what have I done what have I done you know what have you done I showed up here claiming that I was gonna protect you guys and all I've done is gotten us into worse and worse problems Drakken hime has gotten into worse and worse problems the only reason we're here is because we've stuck together we've made decisions as a team and we learn from our mistakes exactly learned a lot from his mistakes and he didn't kill the troll we members not what your sins are we are all sinners and none of us truly deserve the light and purification of the flame but it asks us of that it asks that we give of ourselves for this great purpose sebastian you don't need to listen to these talking flames to be a hero you're already a hero Swire my best friend yeah do you not wish to find our truth here do you not wish to share in our glory and she has a shard in her heart indeed hey oh you've been my friend a lot longer than Lucretia yeah she's talking a lot of things that I want to hear right now these are very important things to me yeah a lot of people will talk a lot of things but I sensed that you've not come here out of the faith that you've come here for some other reason we came here to learn what you represent and we came here to understand what what you are I have nothing to hide the flame illuminates all are we allowed to come in and not partake no we've made this journey it was a very difficult journey if we could but rest one night here there is no place for you here if you will not accept the flame into your heart so you don't represent the good of all people only the people that that will follow you those who turn their back on the flame will be burned by it we're not turning our back you're asking us to drive delirium into our hearts has nobody ever questioned that nobody that has come this far if you make it this far and none that do not come with purpose or a reason like I'm purpose of reason does that not mean that not the same we must serve a purpose and have a reason we saved man what was his name Schaefer Schaefer he told us that we were welcome he told us that it was an age of heroes and you are welcome but not what make your persuasion check not welcome in sixteen I can see that you are not convinced you harbored doubt in your hearts and where there is doubt there cannot be faith if you wish you may stay with us here until you recover your wounds and hopefully you will come to see the light but if you will not stay with us you must leave by morning okay reasonable but I'm still worried about this haze this is the haze like in in the building yes everywhere you just take a hop over to the tower I one moment huddle guys I was hoping that we could maybe stay long enough to learn what we need to learn I don't know there's so much happening right now this is I think we finished I think we got what we need yeah we know they're no threat you guys may have gotten all you need it's not like we can't come back and ask them more questions look uncle you have as you have lots of opportunities to drive delirium into your heart if you don't want to rush it like I'm okay with that like even people sit on tattoos for like a year before they get burned and you don't have to just dive in like don't peer pressure I'm sorry you can do it tomorrow there was nobody's ever the thing is is that she she's we don't even know if people survived the thing she won't even tell us who her oldest followers up she believed up until the meteor hit in the other secret flame mm-hmm she as far as we know she's a Cheryl the charlatan she's a trickster she could believe exactly what she says but the fact that she lives in the space is very scary good bunker sir I think we need to take our time with this and if you do want to make that decision I'll support you in fact I'll hold the hammer I guess I'll help you drive the Delirium in and I might even join you if it requires my help but I think there might be too much of a rash decision all I know is you're right like I'd literally just met her and she kind of I don't know guys I got I got a little lost there beguiled she she said so many things that I've been waiting for somebody to say to me for for 15 years and she knows I think she knows that I mean expert opinion she is one sandwich short of a picnic so take what she says with a grain of salt you are so good at that I know your enemy feature and I want to see if from can you tell me if her current hit points is compared to 67 higher and her total class levels compared to seven higher she's a beast a few guys if you guys think that we should leave that I'm gonna leave and I'm sorry about that I got a little crazy let's stay till morning I don't want to stay in the hey still morning should we just go back we're already exhausted I think we need to are we closer can we get to the Clocktower from here well we'd have to cross the river there's a there's a few bridges right we're already in the city there yes what I see on the map there's birches yes yep so if we cross one of the bridges and yeah pulling open the map you can see that the st. Salinas is a ha has three large towers and a triangular courtyard it used to be st. Salinas has been an abbey a prison and the masai l'm in its time it has a great gate with a drawbridge in front of it that has been left down that Lucretia was standing on you can see that there were flames behind her illuminating it but with even the haze it's difficult to see what's going on in the courtyard you've been waiting outside the walls which are otherwise similar to the walls that surround the entire city but the towers two of the towers are built into the dran River and though the haze is thick with a landmark like the river you might have an easier time getting out of here then you did getting in especially if we if we follow the river to the bridge and then that yeah basically yeah you easy going across temple bridge or Market Square there's the two bridges there's temple bridge and champions bridge you could take either one of those across either into the temple word or up and towards the clock tower have we heard any route is safer uh the there's two problems on either way if you go towards champions bridge you were gonna come extremely close to the great crater mm-hmm but if you take temple bridge on the other side you'll have to pass near slaughter stone square can't we go around slaughter stone you can again you still are going in the vicinity of slaughters nose we're just so you're going in the vicinity of the crater if you want to go back to the tower which I understand it gets us gets us out of the haze we've met all the factions yep I think we have a clear idea on what they all represent now yeah I mean there's obviously some more digging that we could do but in order to take that plunge we're kind of risking our lives yeah I know I respect that decision what about the sewers what if their sewers nearby where we can try to get in the same silliness not through her means but there I don't I don't know if I want to start a war with these yeah they're pretty much focused on their own and I think I mean ultimately they've got their own path what they're doing that aren't really concerned with what else is going on so I mean that's really why we came and I agree we came to figure out what their intentions are and they seemed kind of bold and begged but they don't seem to be I don't think they're gonna interfere with our at least our immediate plans will have to revisit them in the future I also have this book to read you do have to follow up with that book it might be important so I mean if we go back to our Tower I can I can spend the day with mojo I'm wondering if we can also find out some more information about them also from the calling and that's by far at the end the Paladins they might have some information closer to maybe some scientific information rather than this yeah I want to know what this lady was up to before she became like keeper of the everything yeah yeah and we can also meet up with a reference and there's love a good battle with the rat Prince that's that's true I'll give it some armor okay so you're ready to part head back to the Clocktower and regroup deliberate make your next up from there Rico a polite but firm farewell okay we'll take it from there next week oh well interesting developments we've now got all the pieces all the players are now on the board you know what a random iam is like you know what Pluto really like that flower in the garden yeah you were going towards the flower kind of shaky out of it you know it was actually really interesting I didn't know that Sebastian was gonna react that way until it was happening but I was listening to the words that Monty was saying and it literally just fell in line and you did that on purpose I know you did I mean maybe you did I don't know but everything you said how in line with like what are Sebastian's wants in life that's that's what a good gypsy fortune-teller does -
