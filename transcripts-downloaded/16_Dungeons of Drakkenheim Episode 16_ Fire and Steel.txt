remains of the Old Crow housed in amber wood village where Sebastian Crowe was born standing there after it was caught alight by undead creatures that came shortly after you left the mirror that was that was the sanctum or shadowy realm of Sebastian crows mother letteth Eventide leaving that dimension in this home with perhaps more questions than actual answers you now stand outside as the last embers of the fire died down in amberwood village there's a large crack as the Timbers that are the core of the foundations of the building collapse the house its frame shifts to one side and it falls over into a pile of burning rubble can rebuild I wonder if I'll be held responsible for any of this as the townsfolk disperse leaving this cursed home to its final fate River eldritch and Tobias crow approached you and the only sound in the air is the crackling of the flames and the low wind of the night as they all stand and stand vigil over the death of this house what will you do listen we've already had the conversation we had last week they're just standing there watching me being sad and upset it's letting it all sink and I'm like just stewing in my own horrible mess that I've made for myself and all the things I said and did I put my hand on your shoulder and I'm just like Sebastian it's it's time to let it go you know we've had this time and you know you got to at least experience some memory of your mom and in this house but it's done it's not totally done well I mean we still have a clone mum yeah it's missing a soul sure when I thought I was your mom we're done with the house yeah well I mean we don't really have another option in fact and you have a backup house it's true true so I think it's like the worst of the two houses is gone which is kind of a win I mean you didn't even use the other house this has been like a bandit I'm kind of glad to see this thing burned down this way this place has been just horrible let those previous memories burn out of existence and maybe now I won't have screaming nightmares anymore about this house or a hound that would be better you will true I might but now we have a hound that is around so I don't know if that's positive for me or mmm-hmm you know maybe we won't have to smother you with a pillow at night anymore yeah thank you yes this will save us a lot yeah well in that case you're welcome guys I guess I'm also proud of the way you stood up to River yeah she's right she's right there hi River speaking of I should I should go talk to them yeah they're standing a few feet away Albert can River having a bit of a hushed conversation on their own that's what your father is standing on the opposite side of this the side of the street he isn't looking at the house as it burns away he's just seated up against one of the fences of that house across just sighing to himself I approached my father first hey Dad well that's one way to put some bad memories to rest I'll be honest I nearly did it myself several times I just wanted you to know that I I that wasn't an IED iddin intend for that to happen but then again you know you know how it is with me I never intend for these things to happen it's not like it was worth anything anymore anyways I did save the mirror I don't know what you plan to do with that boy neither do i but it's it's all I've got and what's that goo coming out of it that I don't know either which is why I'm gonna go talk to these two things are a little weirder than anticipated I have a lot of questions I don't think you'll be able to answer them but I just wanted you to know specifically that I'm really sorry for any grief that I've caused you not just now but I mean ever boy your mother had secrets she kept from me I didn't know I didn't know if I hadn't known maybe things would have been different but in all the time that I knew her she was just she was a woman that I loved for many years and I thought there was a promise of a of a quiet life and that was what she seemed to want and that's all I've ever wanted then I came along I hope you don't hold that against me I I love the family that you've created here and I hope that you still consider me part of that family Sebastian with the way the world's go on there's not much room for a quiet life anymore but I'm a simple man and all this work of magic and mages it's not for me it's not for the my family it's not for the rest of the children you're welcome to stay here but mine that it I just want to make sure that your sister your brother Moira have a quiet life well they can when I come and visit I don't intend to do anything like this again I just want to come and spend time with you guys quietly and peacefully sounds good you're always welcome thank you I'm gonna get going back now I'll see you back at the house love your dad he gives you a big bear hug and you can tell though there's tears welling up in his eyes but he's the type of person that he he turns away faster he he turns out that as he pulls away from the hug he turns away before the tears can go out but you imagine he might be crying a little bit as he walks away I like to imagine so because Sebastian is definitely like bawling his eyes out as he walks away and he's like I'm not crying you're crying and then he walks up to the river and Eldrick cool River and Eldrick have already approached veo and Pluto and River just turns to the the two of you and says as Sebastian is talking is he gonna be okay oh yeah he's one of the toughest people I know he'll be fine he's under a lot of pressure at work but we're here to help him yeah he's always got his friends yeah so I wouldn't worry too much about him I'd worry about not answering his questions as he comes over here oh he's crying no he's not crying you're great I come over and I'm like hey guys wasn't crying what's up hey Amy here not crying me here just not crying I wasn't crying at all this whole time never cry all the smoke that's why they call me Sebastian never cry crow Eldrick nods a little bit he says I'll try not to think about all those two other times in school he knows you better than you know I occasionally get poked tonight yep spells make my eyes anyway what um so I said some things you did I it was in the heat of the moment there was a lot going on and I hope you understand the situation I I am sorry but there's been a lot of reasons for me to be upset right now including possibly at you guys and I hope you understand that as well I have just come out of a alternate dimension that had various forms of my mother all over it and demon worshipping pets and spell books and then all of a sudden it's leaking goo and there's undead everywhere and then my house burnt down and I'm wondering what the heck is going on maybe you're wondering what the heck is going on or maybe you knew something and I just don't really know and it's a lot of questions and not a lot of answers and it's well here's a mirror and there's my old house and you can kind of see what's up Eldrick and our mirrors leaking he says on opening your mouth in that way we must take caution now lest our enemies forces to play out our hand perhaps it's best best we could hope for is that they see you as an unwitting pawn and he turns to to River and River replies you know perhaps we could turn the rumors and the hearsay to our advantage that you were taken in by the Academy wasn't unknown to these folks so not like they didn't know that you trained there hopefully they might misconstrue that a little bit nevertheless we may need to start acting sooner than anticipated as usual um I know that we might be on rocky terms at the moment but I'm here to do my part to help you guys out um in exchange well not really in exchange I've already kind of messed everything up but as a favor I need this mirror to stop leaking and I don't know what that is or how to solve this Eldrick speaks up was it was it doing this when you found it no really it's a new leak it didn't do this until we laughed the mirror by the way it's a portal to dimension shines because he he says I have a spell that I can use to investigate it now it'll take me some time to cast about an hour should I analyze it and we can make a plan from there I mean this mirror is very important and I don't want to leave it at my parents or I guess I should say my dad's let's assess this now because if this sludge coming out of it is dangerous then we will we should definitely make sure that it's safe can I leave the mirror in your care without risk of it being not until I know what it does okay he takes the time to prepare his ritual pulling out some arcane components what looks to be powdered delirium inhales it and examines it his party party his eyes turn solid amber and he looks over the mirror and he says this mirror in radiates powerful energy from the Shadowlands perhaps it has lain dormant but it is not safe to keep it number would village where is it safe to keep it well the magic here this sludge is pure shadow and the baleful magic is not dangerous on its own but for the company it keeps this is pure shadow it's ambrosia to the walking dead they will sniff it out like a shark smells blood in the water and with all the creatures of that nature that dwell on the outskirts of the city the weaker ones that are hungry and starving might grow bold come into the village we cannot keep this here I can't destroy it it's it's the only answers I have for who my mother was what what would you say I should do with it don't put it in a bag of holy oh there goes there goes my easy option Thanks it is a dimensional rift it will tear a hole in reality if you do that we will need to take it back to the pyramid and we will keep it safe there with all the other baleful artifacts that the Academy keeps safe well I have access to it later I can't promise you that you faucet but what I can promise you is when I go back I will find out everything I can all the records that I can get of your mother and I will bring him to you that sounds like a deal I want to uh do you have a vial yeah I keep a few I want to take some of the shadow goop just so that undead can follow us here you go I see nothing wrong with this can I just put some in a vial okay fine it's your funeral Oh Oh River and I are going to head back to the pyramid we will be gone for some time and when we will return there will be more coming from the Academy okay until then we need you to make sure that none get a meaningful foothold in this city you are fantastic agents of chaos so work your magic none can improve their station or their hold or their grip over this city it is imperative we profit from the anarchy of the city in the time being as long as none approach or breach that tower we are safe and our agenda can proceed there will soon come a time that we do not need to rely on the subject fuge or the cooperation of others until that time chaos must reign in this city it's like the job and wait my whole life for understood cause chaos ah I'm good at that finally my skills returns to rivers neat she says you don't are you sure you want to let them take that now that we have seen what they're capable of he says I have something that you can keep in your bag of holding and he produces a large chest that is sealed in lead remember that piece of delirium you brought us yeah this is the fruit of that labor if you need to you may open this box and when you do so you need to run as fast as you can as fast as I can don't know how far and I don't know how quickly but when you open this box everything nearby you will die and that place will never be a place that people can walk to again understood so why are we opening this potentially up in dragon home I was about to ask that but what about it is small it is a prototype of the destructive potential of delirium we could get rid of all the Noles or all the paladin's perhaps who says the Paladin I don't think it will do that much but if you need to use this to stop someone from getting a foothold somewhere do it understood it's gonna be big is it gonna be loud yes you're gonna know if we do it yes it will not be subtle how do you expect us to get out of there in time she's very fast I am very best you're fast and you can shrink things now uh the boxer should always go faster the whole thing weighs about 30 pounds all you need to do is take this key and open this box and then run I take the key and I put it around my neck on a necklace fashionable that you have both the key and the bomb I think it's great I think we should give a Bayeux the key why from a military standpoint having all of the things on your person is not a good like even even the new killer guys have to stand in separate rooms and turn the keys this is true maybe I should carry the key and you have the bomb I'd take the key put it around my neck we don't entirely know what will happen when this is activated we just know that it will be very destructive so we're more guinea pigs delirium is this make us even about the whole yelling in the street yes yes it does say it does if we try out your your bomb we don't want you to try this bomb out you can use it if it is necessary to further our goals okay it'll probably be necessary it's gonna absolutely because well I'm excited to blow something up I'm just excited to cause mischief that hard-ass permission the core be the only thing that I will tell you is you need to run we are almost certain that this weapon will well we're calling it a disjunction and I do not believe that there is any spell that will protect you from it I don't know I know shield and guys I have a wand it's not gonna protect you and your your one guy my running will protect us will run fast don't worry okay hopefully you'll never have to use it if you haven't used it by the time we get back we want it back okay so find opportunity to use Delirium bomb literally it's trying the key in the hall right now you're like what if what if we just I've got ideas I've got ideas thank you for the ball thank you for the bomb thanks for not yelling at us thanks for not making today harder than it already is for me I do really I do appreciate that let's make no mistake here oh go ahead you are valuable to us thank you because of your destructive tendencies thank you it's the same reason I got kicked out of school there will come a time that we need to be a little more pragmatic than that but for now as I said let chaos reign in dragon high and its name cell shall be sebastian crow they on the biscuits the three crows with that will if if there are no more questions with that ours is a friendship of convenience so not to exert they wrap up with the assistance of their late mail-clad Guardians they wrap up and package the mirror attach it to the top of the eldritch wagon and they are gone before sunrise I guess that is the end of that huh I think we deserve a little rest from here wouldn't you say boys I could use a shower wait to shower success that's appropriate for you all to take a few days of downtime spend what a couple days a week in Everwood Village resupplying three days we have things to do yeah no rest for the wicked okay about three three days off gluto what do you think well I was just no pressing matters I think it's allowed to have we've been weaving we've been hustling yeah Noel's running rampant paladin's outside the city of the queen is in Oscar's care there's there's nothing pressing like a regular day of the week in dragon home okay how would you like to spend your downtime then fishing you know how to fish this okay well there's a skill that you picked up I don't think I've ever heard of chicken if you knew a chicken they could do good answer solid I like that I'm gonna okay wait are we planning like a day fishing trip is that what we're doing what do you want to do with your three days off three days off three-day weekend I I don't know I've never had three days off before what could you imagine doing if you had three days off I could just maybe sit down and and and read a book about killing monsters just brush up on some of my on some of my knowledge maybe just a pause for a moment is our internet okay and I really hold no okay just refresh on you're on cuz I'm still going out here everyone's still with us just let us know chat I mean I could fish could you fish well yeah I think so okay good yeah I'll read a book while you guys fish yeah this is a weird network error that's all okay everything's fine everything's good yeah okay I'm gonna be like tie the string to your like big toe and you can feel it you can do that yeah I mean I'm all as a visitor to these lands I'm all for you know trying out whatever downtime do we just take it back a moment there just because I need to catch back in yeah because the network stuff yeah so what are your plans going forward with the downtown yeah well we have we want to go fishing and fishing we're gonna go fishing Pluto what were you you just you're just I'd love to read a book and maybe kind of just partake in some of the the activities of of Drac and I'm kind of learned and I also would love to check in on my armor right with your dad oh yeah I also like I think I really want to spend some quality time with new family not worrying not talking about old mom now talking about the old house not any of that I just want to like you know have some lunches sip some tea sit by the fire maybe tell the kids some cool stories about our travels spend some quality time with my dad maybe like try to help him out in the workshop even though I'm gonna be terrible at it help help Moira around the house what's something the kids could do it did they like is there like a local swimming hole or yeah there's there's the amber wash River which is a tributary of the the dran River which is run through town and there's lots of sights and sounds and some good drinking at the various establishments around town oh we're also hitting up the pub okay I want to do my day up at night dirty oil shopping shopping okay so the next few days pass relatively quietly you're able to find some good spots for some fishing along the river you are able to spend some good time with your family it's a little hard to find a good book around here pollute Oh rats yeah rats what about your rats yeah pretty although there's there's lots of local stories that people are happy to check aynd of show off my Caspian colors to try to entice them to tell me about some local rumor and places to check out um there is much activity going on in everweb village of course there are always more people coming to Drakon hime and every day you see the groups of gathering folk the pilgrims of the falling fire that come and gather and make their way into the town often two with a fiery sermon delivered in the middle of the city and Sebastien you noticed that when you spend some time with your father around the shop like he really listens to them when like he doesn't really say anything but he sometimes does stop when you pass through this Square and you hear the things that they're saying you recognize the man that's the man that you saved earlier that Abraham Shaffer fellow the these stern-looking long faced preacher and they continue to spout their usual proclamations of usually metaphors that go something along the ways of you've heard it said that the fire that burns twice as bright burns half as long you've heard it said that the brightest flames cast the darkest shadows but these are words for a patient time a warm hearth the sanctuary from the deep winter of sleeping sins yet when the winter snows melts into a rushing flood that threatens to extinguish every flame to wash away all that cold comfort the beacon sent by the brightest flames are the first to be saved and my dad like stops to listen to all this I I tug on his sleeve hey I saved that guy did you yeah first one of the first times in the city he was being held up by some bandits I saved his life once he said that there was going to be a new age of heroes he told me I was one of those heroes do you I think so oh you're here - I was having a father-and-son moment but how's it going hide well because your father has been working on that plate mail for peluda and this this plate mail will be finished at the end of the three days and for all intents and purposes forged of meteoric iron it is effectively a suit of adamantium plate mail and while you wear it you are immune to critical hits dad so any critical hit scored against you will become a regular head I'm just like a better son oh I mean I mean I can't even argue he says it's some of my finest work may a guard you against the darkness of the world and protect your heart let that flame burn brightly that's the nicest thing he's ever said to me but it was - you promise not to get acid on this we make no promises oh I think this one will hold up far better than the last suit I challenged and thank you so much is there anything I can do to repay you don't die in it and I'll protect yours I'd hate to lose it oh yeah that's fair that just kind of got glazed over didn't it yeah he really really has no I'll predict your armor public yard sorry don't worry I stepped on your mother you just stepped in and started talking about armor and I just like faded into the background as one of the days passes there's you can see that there are in town as well once in a while you catch a glimpse of some of the hooded lanterns that drop into town to pick up supplies for a few days you had heard that there were paladin's of the silver order that had been dwelling in the in the chapel here but they've left and they packed up all their things and headed back to their main encampment and there there's no presence of them here in the town they just left tracking huh they've left everwood village oh the rumors say that they've gone to the there's more talk around the town of the campsite that the silver order has set up on the other side of the Grand River they've come in once in a while to trade and there have been arguments between them and some of the hooded lanterns that have been in town and a few theological debates people jokingly say between the silver order and those of the pilgrims as well Pluto what's your take on the paladins think they kind of look a little bit like you there from there from the other place yes I'm not I never took geography you're from caspia mm-hmm they're from not cavea correct and a notch from Illyria Illyria yes I knew that Illyria we call it not caspia where I'm from it's easier wait what do you what do you call this oh this is you'll know this as new not cassia wonderful what's your take on the paladin's I actually have quite a bit of respect for them I think they're doing great work I do find them a little bit zealot II with their whole religious doctrine and so forth but guys killing monsters and suits of armor like I align with that greatly and they're great warriors and they like ridding the world of evil so and where I'm from Castilla we have you heard of it once or twice yes you know we always respect fine warriors so I might not see eye to eye on everything but for most of their swinging and hitting I'm down with it I get on down there skills are respectable but you know they are coming clomping into territory that isn't there so I don't know if I can respect that I imagine the three of you sitting on a riverbank with your fishing lines having this conversation never met a paladin that I could get along with they do have some really like tight rules I'm a little more loose with my feelings towards law and order however I do respect that they are the it you know you find that if you find one paladin it's like you you met want you met one you met them all and it's a very consistent experience across to all paladin's whereas with other types of people you can get a really mixed a lot of their personal feelings come into play whereas paladin's are very focused so what you're saying is I gotta hate them all you if you hate what you hate them all is exactly great fighting skills sturdy morals yeah I'm a little I'm a little lenient on my morals from time to time and I tend to take the path of mischief and mayhem to get things done and paladin's don't necessarily agree with that often I haven't had many dealings with them but they tend to be the ones wagging their finger at me being like what you did is bad and I'm like yeah rules of nature rule me so you know rules paladins not my forte but anyway sounds like there's something going on with them so and that does concern me a little bit any type of big movement of paladin's that can can still cause a lot of problems when we're trying to get our chaos done we were told to keep an eye on them and report back to the hood at lanterns so if they're moving might be something we need to go check out also we don't want anybody gaining a foothold in Drakon hime according to the amethyst Academy so whatever the paladin's are up to sitting on the outskirts of Drakon Heim is concerning we have no idea what their business here is so yep anybody caught any fish yet I have no idea how this works oh my god any [ __ ] yesterday the catches her the catch was really good but today it's been rather meager you've picked a few fishing spots along the river and the fortunately the the amber wash river is not tainted in the way that the Duran River is it's a it's one of the few like a good source of fresh water and decent enough fishing but today for the the past hour so the the fishing has been pretty lean yeah um how deep is the river um at its deepest maybe about 10 15 feet deep okay is it like shallow on both sides or did it like go pretty soft shallow earthy embankment lightly forested and wooded with some rocky outcrops here and there as always it's an overcast day with the sun's rays barely peaking the clouds you'll get a little bit of Sun once in a while an ember would village because it's but it's usually not terribly sunny a little bit of vitamin D first time in weeks seventh it's been 17 years Sebastian gets annoyed at fishing and starts firing fire bolts at fish it's like this pole thing doesn't even work and he starts shooting fire bolts I'm just like no no no no no I'll show you their way to do it and I tossed my fishing rod aside and I wade into the water and I like put my hands in the water and I try to wait till a fish comes into my hands to grab it with my claws okay as you reach down into the water you feel something lumpy like there's some grass or something stroking along your legs it's rather large and somewhat and you smell a smell that is through like coming up through the the water like that is rather familiar to you ah something smells like sewage smells big gross Sebastian did you take that shower you said you were gonna take no that's probably just I think it's something a little bit more and I start to walk out of the water like I think we picked a bad spot well yeah there's not really many fish here as you do so veo you feel something grasp around your ankle and it grabs and it holds for a moment and then almost releases like it's too weak to hold the grasp I run out of the water like ah something grabbed me good things in here I stand at the edge of the water and I start is is it like really murky or um it's not clean water it's not clear water sorry it is clean water but it's not clear it's kind of a but the water does get deep enough that you can't see all the way down to the bottom Pluto can can we see your drift globe yeah something I'm gonna activate the drift globe and like toss it over the water okay the light of the graphical pierces through the murky darkness of the water below and as it as the light shines up over it you can see that in rattling I rushed into the water and I'd be like a dramatic like I'm like heavily running like it's lower and I'm waiting and I'm going for the body okay you lift it up and it is the rat prince is he breathing barely oh maybe I bring him to shore and I'm like don't you die on me give him mouth-to-mouth okay I'll give him mouth-to-mouth I'm gonna lay them down on the embankment okay I start giving him mouth-to-mouth I do the chest compressions I lift his legs it's helping all right this is a oh you can make a medicine check these two can make a medicine check and if they make a dc-10 if they both make a dc-10 they might grant you advantage on yours oh I got a 19 okay I got an 18 had a five okay so it'll be the straight roll which is after some pushing basically push down on his chest and AG out of water shoots out of out of his MA was I giving him mouth-to-mouth into Sebastian's face and it's the yeah along with probably whatever the most recent contents of his stomach where it would seem to be some happy I need a shower he's so he's spurting up water the sea is he breathing what he's breathing he's alive but he he's barely conscious okay buddy he comes into after a little bit more shaking intending to he comes into view into a look he comes around coughs up more water vomits a little bit and he says oh I am dead dead dead I see ghosts I am surely dead no prints you're alive we saved you again how many times I was dragged about no what is this place these green fields these trees son Oh welcome this is where I live Oh No you are truly dark spirits ghosts have I died no you're alive really what happened yeah why were you what it seems like you were swimming for a lot longer than you should be swimming what you came down you were not you you were not a tick tock tock clock you were not there you are not a tick tock clock that was where you said you would be oh we're taking a vacation very changed I try to find you a tick tock look and then I run run run and there's no way I take River and I swim swim swim and I keep and he blacks out for another half hour or so becomes 2 and this repeats where he's convinced that he's dead and he's a ghost blames you for not being at the clock passes that one more time until finally he seems to kind of come around after the offering of a little bit more food you have food yes yes very hard to talk on empty stomach we give it yeah we give him some fish very very good choice maybe you can just give me some of the stuff you threw up on you I made sure he gorgeous and I gave him on his own pump i give him a ball of his own very good recycled food is green Thank You rod pick in the head so reference you obviously swam so far that you almost drowned yourself what do you need to tell us there but oh oh why come this far I might need more food might help me remember he's a he's a good bargain er I give him a whole fish from the other day it's catch devours it whole week Utley oh oh wait very bad very bad I remember it very very bad well how about he he kind of pulls up his is what passes for clothing of him and you can see that he turns around shows you his tail which has been almost burned black and and he pulls up his whatever rags he's wearing and there's burns all down his back and he says oh it's very bad it very that we have to run run run run run the there are shiny metal manlings all over all over town they come they come and and and they're fighting fight fight fight but they bring not just stab stab stab but they burn us they burn us they have fire burn burn burn right in our holes such a mess bad bad bad they are all over there burning all the old buildings burning and burning them we run but they chase us we run down our holes but they said smoke and they burn burn oh my god what happened to the other rattling x' they cut them up and they burn them all they chase us into the water and we run and I came I ran - tick tock clock to find you to tell you to get you to help but you weren't there and then we have to run all the way back and they catch us they burn us - and so we ran into River it was only place we could go it's bad bad bad I'm so sorry yes all those rattling that's so much money loss that's so much of our investment yeah no there are the big dog yet Ben - they yep and they fight and they are fighting the big shiny men there's neither will help us there is nowhere for us to hide we just run run run and we can swim in the river but then there are bigger fish and they eat us can you take what's left of your rattling and set up camp in the base of the

do are you going to kill him we're going to figure it out take things one step at a time rod Prince we don't go straight for the jugular we wait a second don't want to hurt the Paladins but if they are interfering with dragon high mana on a grand scale there we may need to step in and one way or another they will not get to you unless they go through us first oh you go ghosts you go at scary ghosts yes you look not too scary right now but you scary ghosts I know we've actually had three days of relaxing so we look less scary than usual just wait till we get back into battle I go to look extra scary just wait hunting is tough on a ghost it takes a lot of life you also need time to pray to the rat God to make sure that you know we're doing the due diligence as his supporters maybe the rats and the shiny man to test us yes yes yes only the strong survive yes yes yes oh then we breed and have many more rats strong rats yes yes that's right you know yes eating fish people and no the

good so mm-hmm I need to figure out what's going on these paladins this is not good yes we have brought Prince with us I guess our Vicky yeah oh yeah we still have the pup or did we do the pub I guess we're headed to the encampment to talk to the paladins Pluto what if they're on the outskirts we can still maybe reach them before they get to the city yeah and maybe Serta kind of deal or at least find out what their intentions are yeah okay this this this style just doesn't seem like unless they see it is like a big black hole the mess you look off in the distance to see a big black hole of a mess that is dragon hunt yeah they can be really mean maybe they're on to something I think if anybody can relate to them and show them where they're doing wrong it's you Pluto yeah maybe I can turn them around yeah and if not Sebastian can trick them in some way all right I can talk but you know them better so you and I can maybe talk them into backing off I don't know what they'll think of me have they never seen a Taback sea before I'm not as shiny as them you know I don't know if they're gonna be all I hope yeah the city they shouldn't mistake you for a monster you know like how Pluto was only first met him I was I nothing you were friends you you've always been me great you know now you're like down to earth literally the earth is on you you know what the dragged you through the streets okay screaming and yep now you're one of us one of us forgot what it's like to be pampered I miss it keep forgiving it can you good that's something for me no you go fetch that never didn't work I teach us to survive in this crazy world Pluto I don't even have magic either I do do everything by myself I have to carry things hood out you never have to do anything by yourself that's true [Laughter] carry things so that was like a Baltimore awkward emotionally you plan us to set out yeah and make for the encampment of the silver order yeah yeah okay but let's get some potions let's

heard strong stuff do you have any other nifty potions mmm at this time oceans of water breathing or climbing if you were interested in such a purchase how much for one of each 100 per I'll take one of each fine no no no could always use the ability to breathe underwater and we've seen me try to climb so could be better at that yeah we almost died a fine pleasure doing business with you all I can't interest you in a few more oceans of healing can i what would you give me for this old shield is magical it's stopped a lot of magic so if that's how magic gets stored and then it's a cursed shield my good man no okay I need something more remarkable for my inventory I'm afraid I understand perhaps one of my guards will purchase it from you one of the later on one of the guards offers you a half a half-finished bottle of brandy for it do it I look around and I accept okay and then I chugged the bread now I'm saving it he also got his armor from my dad has that happened yes indeed would you be interested in selling that fine piece oh yeah [Laughter] where did you get that exquisite novel I have a guy does it come in a larger size I'm sure it could be fitted however your line of questioning is working I'm actually I think it's very exquisite shade of silver I see you may admire it but it does belong it it kind of doesn't even belong to me it rented yeah it's more of like a it's at least I'd trade you the shield for it that's armor of the three crows yeah do you know I don't know I'm just trying to get my name yeah that's current worry about your lie is three of us I would trade you this amulet that will preserve you even when you are on death's door for it for the armor don't do it the armor it's so good I it's so hard to say and it's brand-new and I haven't even tested over yet fine but maybe I can but I don't pay full price for you to gear oh I I just I feel like it's not even mind to trade but thank you for your admiration and your your dealership I hope that when you die in that city someone finds the armor and decides to sell it to me but until that time I wish you good fortune if he dies I'm bringing the armor bats the nicest thing you've ever said to us oh please he's always looking out for us well anyways we'll be off with my sister right take care of the little girl now he says tapping his nose I grab her and you're a princess like I have never seen so I have never seen an ogre before that man was very fat Betty I'm very surprised he not eat you he was so big it's a lot of candied salmon emotion I wish for one day that I could be that fat I would be so happy someday little sister rabbits someday we'll call her petunia I like this name I guess that wraps up our we done in Everwood village everybody got their cool stuff okay so the paladin's encampment of the encampment of the Silver order from everything that you heard lies west of the city that does mean crossing the drain' River at some point your options would be then to travel across the countryside directly or and in which case you would be simply traveling across open fields and countryside with no necessary bearing or you can take the roads back into Drakon Heim and then follow the roads back out from the city so we could go in like near the Cathedral like are down south of the crater well the the Paladins and kevin is not in the city at all no it's it's a temple road right right yes outside - okay from what you've heard it is not it's not even inside the ruins of the city it's a few miles outside town because remember you spotted it from the right so yeah it's a few miles outside town along temple Road as it comes into the city could we take the the could we take sticks across I mean we did hear that they were burning buildings which leads me to believe that now they've approached the city so I would say if we take sticks across we can just head to temple road and try to cut them off before they reach the main wall Saba's yeah I don't see why that wouldn't work yeah pay the fare get across yeah I can get us there fast as possible you're not gonna sink the boat with your new fancy armor are you is that part of it you look heavy you look heavier than you already did yes you'll heavier it's it's vacation pounds okay once we start running around again I'm sure I'll shed it will help you okay let's light a bomb I'll get a good sprint on what are you doing with the disjunction device I'm keeping it in the bag of holding the key okay which and veil is gonna keep I was told was okay to put it in the back of hold okay do you guys think that's a good idea to have his foot up I thought that was just a smart fat militant I think it's a needless precaution but you know I understand why you want to do that and I will oblige okay yes um safety first fine a distant second okay so you set out from ember wood village a long champions way towards the heart of the city again through the spokes and a cross sticks is ferry towards the sprawl where temple Road then branches out to the city as you approach dragon hime coming over the rolling hills it is later on in the afternoon and you can already see over the hills the rising smoke of the fires that have been set in the sprawl the outer reaches of the city are aflame the old buildings what remains of them are being are collapsing quickly and burning but the fires as you look across in the distance is very much a controlled flame the you can see that the fire hasn't spread like wildfire the city or anything like that it appears to be kept to the area a long temple road that is being burned down and almost like it is some sort of controlled demolition not happy about this I have seen too many buildings burning down lately this is this is upsetting these bad omens you know there's no need for them to burn down dragon highs a little disturbing because like what is their intention yeah because and why now why have they chosen this moment to do sort of like this cleansing fire mm-hmm I think we need to go talk to them better we got to figure this out yeah as you cross the river on sixes ferry you can hear howling coming across the river the howling and caning barking and yipping of packs of Knolls and their death dogs screaming out and howling and you can hear the screams of war cries and a blaring horn being sounded as well there is fighting happening in the sprawl that was a dog you guys remember that uh we get paid for knoll heads you guys want to make some coin and talk to some paladin's I'm up for you know putting the dogs in their place I'm feeling a little heavy about my my bag of gold is feeling a little light so I think I'm uh it's time to hunt some Knolls before we dive back in again though I want to give a big thank you to Action

tidings from the rat prince who they dressed up as petunia was a petunia yeah it's petunia the rat prince is completely loving his new digs and is going and on your way back to Drac and I'm saying oh yes I will tell all the other rats I am now Prince petunia they will all be so jealous of my lovely dress they will want it they will try to steal it how can I trust them no no I will have to hide the dress I cannot show them they will stab me and eat me oh wait maybe many of them are dead now so aren't you their leader yes yes yes recognize he's in such good disguise oh [Music] no would that be funny they are so foolish they would think I was a ghost just like you I knew it never said fully fooled it never even occurred to me to trick somebody like that rat Prince boys very very mean you're so clever oh yes I think we're in rat hat yeah and the as you slink back in towards town as you board on the ferry with old mr. sticks who's still there rotting away the rat Prince says oh yes from here I get back - tick tock clock yes yes I go find others that scary place over there they're going to try to burn you alive but you kill them all yesyes yes we'll take care of it you kill them yes yes killing is not always the answer rat save something for me if any of them die I will well you leave them out in the street yeah I love streets you love Street me I do it is so good it is so good deal you have yourself a deal right I mean petunia Ritz petunia you know we like the Paladins on fire maybe it's like it's like a like an oven oh no you're game for I just look I'm just it do it no bad ideas and brainstorming okay that's fair that's fair I'm in breaking out that okay as the ferry lands the smell of embers and burning overtakes the air there's a thick ash and there is an acrid smell in the air smell of burning oil and [ __ ] like and looking at the flames that are there burning there is a chemical smell coming from the flames being carried on the air and the howls of combat and the din of battle can be heard in the distance always once in a while it's not uncommon to hear a stray scream in Drakon Haim or a howl or the sounds of battle in the distance but this sounds like war I'm ready you guys are ready to get in the middle of a war yeah it means knocking some knowles out i'm in three day vacation jump into war that's how it goes in Drakon Heim yeah I mean you're not wrong ready Pluto war is glorious however it is with equal weight perilous we have to look out for each other and we're usually not the only ones that are affected by war I think the play here might be to focus on killing the Noles to grant us hopefully some favor with the Paladins so that we can talk them down from burning the rest of the town yeah I mean there's no need to go in there and start murdering paladins before we talk to them so let's help them take out the Noles and then talk to them yeah cool I've never heard you sound so wise before by the way so it's you're bordering on like intelligent ideas should I can change no it's good it's good if we open up our map you have just crossed the dran River at the point mark 8 on the map and the flames that you can see if you see that your map where it says temple road and the road follows down to the south from there the flames seem to be coming from the southernmost points there along the along the kind of buildings along the outskirts right now it hasn't quite shot through all the way here but you can see here and there you can smell it in the air the fires spreading and it seems like the flames are radiating as well as that there might be the stray building out along this way along the river that has caught fire as well as you came as you look down the river you can see that the the so several of the buildings that are furthest out along the river have been burned away it's almost like something is working its way from the outskirts of the city inwards towards the walls starting fires as they go looks like we can see a clear path and where they've been is this you know I didn't start these fires actually this this is one of the rare cases where the incident occurring is not my fault these are not incidents these are specifically made fires they're building murderers I'm not happy about it fair yeah this feels very deliberate yep what's your approach do you want to be sneaky I feel like you do I want to try oh we can try and because I can use pass without trace to get us in there at least a little bit more sneaky than usual let's move towards the howls and nulls and try to flank them well they're fighting the paladin's surprise yeah if we can surprise them with brute force jumping out from behind the buildings and just blasting them with our magic powers magic powers you're imaginary okay I'll I'll take them all down you guys just do what you do find a vantage point I'll yell at them I'll give a stern but Stern but fair warning thank you so so we want to sneak in around the flank yeah let's let's go for it let's let's chase the dog noises I'm gonna cast pass without trace okay okay so you head through the sprawl with pass without trace yeah heading towards the sound of battle in the air making your way westward towards temple road you're so you have to say within 10 feet of them with four paths with the trees yeah so and how are you gonna travel are you gonna travel along rooftops are you gonna travel on the ground are you gonna go Street to Street I say ground Street should be alleys yeah okay moving like between buildings policy oh 33 30 feet okay so that that gives you a little bit more lead way in a way value take point I'm gonna have all of you roll me at d6 smells burn three five four okay Vail as you dart forward across one of the wider thoroughfares because you're taking point I assume basically the way that you're going is you dart forward make sure the path is clear and then motion motion creep up it's in in this moment give me a perception check fifteen okay as you cross across the street all of a sudden there is a crash and you hear the whinnying of a terrified horse as it stumbles forward into the street dragging a broken rider upon it stumbling forward down the street and chasing after the horse gouging into its sides our pack of ravenous nulls they're coming they have come between the streets between you and Sebastian and Pluto so they darted out just as you as you came across rate and that's what second moment what are you gonna do I'm going to push myself up and stop moving against the building and I'm gonna motion kind of hand in the air like this for them to stop and we practiced this because before we used to just yell back and forth but now we're so wise to the game all right give me a dexterity Jacky and this is just gonna see if you catch yourself fast enough to keep them in range of pass without trace 20 okay you do you can all make a stealth check with the benefits of pass without trace is it plus ten plus ten twenty three twenty three twenty twenty okay thank you pass without your yes amazing that's even with the disadvantage that I put okay so you are in one of the broken side streets making your way towards temple road there are several alleys veering off and overturn cart in the middle as this horse stumbles forward and cries cries out as you see it come forward you can see that the riders head has been cleft in two it is one of the paladin's of the silver order being dragged along side on the horse the behind it are a war band of nulls viciously crying out leading several packs it looks like there's a at least ten of them along with a pair of their barking and howling hounds the reference left right he peace out okay good we have to worry about him well I was gonna say there's food now but are they like ganging up on the horse that like all ten of the Knowles or are they kind of all around they are rushing that as you sit and watch they rush forward and they take down the horse and they begin tearing it to shreds yipping and laughing I'm motioning towards them to like not not attack cuz there are more Knowles that we're gonna come across this is just one pack cross swords attack is that what is that we didn't go over this this is just clash of swords kill kill kill this is so easy to interpret skill okay kill one kill the first one to kill the horse kill the first one leave the rest for her okay no no we've got this wrong there's so many there's so many and I point towards the area we were going she wants us to cross the street with the pack of no they're not much time to decide right there are they paying attention to us they haven't seen you yet you want us to sneak around them I'm with Klunk Klunk I grab I grab Sebastian and I serve I serve pushing you if we're going run okay you're gonna run across the street I'm gonna sneak across the street okay you're okay so you're Sebastian into the street I stumble you make the dexterity checks to cross as fast as you can because in this moment it's about can you get across the street fascinating you hide cuz there's nowhere to hide I grab Pluto's hand okay make dexterity checks just dexterity mmm ten-four okay so as you go to cross the street you grab the lose hand and it's like that awkward hand grab where it's just a little bit too like are we having a blinked fingers little stops for a second just in response to it the two of you look at each other and then you look up and then you look across the street and right in front of you are like these Knowles that are eating the leg of a horse the Knowles look up and the four of you all have a moment of like the Knowles looking at you looking at each other and then it's almost like the Knowles are watching it as you're holding hands like are those two guys Knowles have this like underneath their Farrell expression there's this look of like are they holding hands I look at the two Knowles when I go are you two holding hands and they look at the hands of they're like you were honest I okay I'm going to is I'm holding Sebastian said I I do the Cape of the month a bank and I just disappear after I say are you two holding hands and they looked out we disappear where are you going a hundred and fifty feet in front of you a hundred and fifty feet in front of a oh okay that is going to take you into a house okay I'm gonna go just pass-fail okay so you go just passive AO okay roll for initiative they don't know where we went I'm throwing that out there I get it we're gonna roll for initiative okay that teleporting is gonna be your first action okay okay we could have had surprise but instead we had a hand-holding moment little Sebastian friends forever I wasn't ready for the linked thing we should have gone for the length fingers I thought it was safer that way never let go fail I blame you sorry so this little alley right there the one with the full rooftop Sebastian and Pluto that's where you're coming from on the small alley Street yeah and then veo is on the other side on the other building dilapidated I think they've broken down yeah well yeah you try I don't know why Pluto and Sebastian always have to have moments it's a thing I thought we could make it I never thought we could make it I was just following directions I I thought if we waited too long we'd have to roll Mordy sixes where what if more North Shore yeah okay but more or less I was like we gotta get it we gotta get moving we always start talking about in the stupidest ways and I love it I love it so much Jane we kind of fall into combat we always surprised anyone oh we always think we have a plan and then we always make it worse we make it so bad it's always halfway between you guys and then you try to like okay maybe I'll be no I was ready to drop a spell on those guys hey what do we got 1613 thank you yeah I just stopped trying to be cute or you know what you should just worry about being sneaky on your own like I appreciate that but maybe I'm holding you back even with your sneakiness the question they didn't see veo they did not see they oh they did not see her she is hidden from them Oh does having fail gets a surprise she doesn't get surprised because she because combat has started before she could initiate it yep she would be who have been the initiator to gain surprise in this situation instead we were the initiators with our hands you initiated it so yeah so you can see the alleyway and the two of you stuck in the middle of the street there the whole pack of knowles going over the the horse they are the first to go okay I am going to use my agility because I want to try to get around the back of the Knowles double my speed so I get sixty feet so if I can make my way around the side of this building here you get that how many come and eat that that means 55 okay and [Music] I'm gonna take my three shots on my first turn using my dread ambusher okay there is a goal yeah you can see that the two Knowles that were feasting on the on the horse are noticeably larger than the others and they are partially albino their fur like a gray white their fangs longer than the others and they're beside the other ones that are tearing yet they're the two they're the two naked Noel's of my miniatures yeah I'm gonna yeah take a shot at one of them because they're as long as they're within five they're within five feet of one another they are not within five feet of one another they're on other sides of the horse yeah balls in the middle within 5 feet I just want to see if there's anybody right beside each other no they're mostly all pretty spread out okay yeah then I'm gonna take at the Knowles feasting on the force okay six the shot flies right wide past the knoll you get advantage on your first shot or it might be because she was hidden yep you do have advantage on her shop Oh 17 that buh-bam yes it does nice just check out my stuff 18 damage the arrow whistles past the other Knowles and strikes the null in its upper shoulder and it howls out dropping the piece of horse meat take another shot at it okay but it's worse feet that hits nice splitting the first arrow 20 damage that leaves it blood Oh God the spurt of blood as the arrow goes clean through splitting the premium which guys that is that this guy up here oh yeah yeah okay 17 that is also a perfect hit 19 the last shot goes right through his eyeball fires out the other side and and you as you see the arrow whistle into the building behind it with the eyeball still like spinning in it pulling out the socket actually pulling out like brain matter at the back as the arrow just swiftly slides sings through the air I can see we're not he needed here so yeah so the big one on the rock is just totally and for my last 10 feet Madren ambushers that gives me 80 feet total I'm going to move back he said it was 55 so as much as I can move back nice shot through the windows okay Pluto you're up ah I'm holding hands with my best friend hey bud and we're going to we're gonna dimension door past veo over here by the back of the building cool you go much farther if you want to eat in fact you can go totally off the board I wanna I'm gonna hide behind that we're gonna hide behind that building okay I'm gonna take you you're coming and then motion to video as she comes back her in the corner okay Sebastian so we're not we're not we're we're trying to avoid this fight well I mean at least now we're together family so I shouldn't I mean do you oh man I don't know what to do with my turn right now because I don't know where we're at we just teleported all the way over here are we like I look at you and I'm like are we leaving yes okay I'm gonna - Oh which way we're heading this way yeah okay I just yeah and I should have kept running but I was standing there and I turn around and you're gone all right which way are you gonna go - in this direction okay as you - around the house into the next Street there's another group of a dozen Noel's crossing the street as well can I stop and like run back like u-turn like you literally turn around the corner and are like and you see them immediately there's 12 more of them right over there give me ace because you turn to - they see you and one of them perks up and just isn't and starts barking in your direction and many of the nulls begin to turn to pursue I run back to Pluto and I grab him there are so many more Noel's we have so many problems right now I need you to stab as many things as you can have I used my action to - yeah cuz you ran out and then you ran back I jump inside this building okay you smash through the through the what remains of the glass in there and you jump inside the building okay we did real good I need to get more nulls I warn you and jump give you 25 more uninterrupted turns and will be will be done this encounter no I'm working on a good collection don't worry oh yeah I'm waiting for the group the group the grouping you get you get sneak attack if either of us are engaged with an enemy yep no if we are engaged with an enemy you get Co we can start so start picking off any enemies that are fighting Pluto I'll go fight things enemy is a target yeah were the enemies of the target unless you want to shoot I have like another 1000 miniatures somewhere but I don't know where I put them Oh shucks looks like there's only a few more Noel's coming yeah so we'll put these four out over here for now actually werewolves they're not werewolves look dogs cool yep so four more of the the Noel's you kicked down the door I guess eh yeah so for more the the Noel's show up and one of them runs up to the window no close the door and look over my window and there's still like a bit of glass of the windows of the nose like presses its face up against it yeah and you know the way that like a dog presses its face up against the glass and starts licking the glass it's and then it punches the glass and it it breaks through and the other Knolls begin howling and snarling as well Pluto next up you're safe in there right no what did we do oh my god we wanted to fight things dogs do they smell me now several of these Knowles begin turning around in pursuit it seems like you can't see it from your allo veil you can kind of see it several of the Knowles that are further down the street are more content - dogpile but [ __ ] the corpse of the horse as these others have turned around and taken interest in the group of you on the other hand excellent go to the top of the round with Vale are those dogs they are yep the the to death dogs lurch down the alleyway dashing all the way up to you and I cast Zephyr strike okay and I so that way you don't get opportunity attacks I'm gonna climb up the building to get to the second floor okay how far this one is only a one-story building so it's about 15 feet to get up to the next floor 1012 feet yeah and then I take my aim at the dog that's actually closest to Pluto okay [Music] cool I will grant you advantage to your elevated position 22 to hit yes you hit it squarely in the back you got sneak attack I guess you could say any time that you have advantage you get sneak attack at any time that it is engaged with one of your friends yeah just what I hope you do all the damage oh she needs more damage right she's taking it out on this dog I think the gloom sucker Ranger rogue is a really nice combo [Laughter] 31 wait that wasn't even a critical hit okay so this this vicious arrow rips through the spine of this of this monstrous two-headed death dog and it seems like the one of the heads might actually be dead from the shot but the rest of the dog is continuing to go based on the remainder of the other other brain and spine so this is just a slobbering limp head on one side I'm actually gonna take aim at the other dog because Pluto you can take care of the dining one leaving scraps for Pluto to clean up thanks man that's a 23 to hit yes indeed how often can you sneak attack once per turn okay 17 damage and the second head is not alive anymore either the dog collapses in a heap oh sorry I was sitting the one that was e to me yeah 17 damages burned it out okay okay Bluto you're up I'm gonna take a swing at the the half dog the regular dog is swinging around the corner okay and I credit what happens I don't think it's gonna survive I chop both heads off and I'm using my longsword right now nice save those oh yeah we got a if we survive this we're gonna be so much gold and then I'm gonna rush the other dog at the bottom of the right below veil and balance of the universe I got a one perfectly balanced and I'm gonna shield slam it into the into the wall with eat sorry 9 it stays up ok that four-legged power no Sebastian you're up the know the Knowles are rattling if the windows and clawing at the doors what are you gonna do I jumped through this window it's a glass in this window yeah oh can I just crash right through it if you want to I do an action hero jump through this window and I come out the other end like huh Oh God you do take two points of slashing damage that that was way not as cool as it making acrobatic check-in 18 yeah you land on your feet I'm only bleeding a little bit Oh God and I am going to okay first of all can i quicken my special casting of darkness is that something I can do using the sorcery points to cast darkness as a quick and spell or is that too many things I don't know the answer to this but I'm going to say yes okay yeah because that's a very hefty investment of sorcery points for one thing yeah cuz your points they're gonna cost you because I know you can't apply meta magic more than once but it's not ya file this one under let's look this up after the game okay but yes for now I cast darkness on me and say quick and spell oh my and then I'm also going to one second I'm going to pull out the fireball scroll oh baby and I'm going to use it on this crowd over here okay what a good way to get around the two actions per turn thing okay fire so I you pull out the the scroll of fireball oh and you can see in the darkness so you can read the words on the page in front of you and you let it rip a low blossom of flame erupts out of the dark the field of darkness colliding into the street and sending a massive explosion rippling through the streets the Noles two of them say but two of them fail and the long thing actually succeeds the save it's okay sweet mother of pancakes I need to borrow one d6 thank you it's a trite roller it's 86 for fireball correct yes good and bam I'm gonna use meta magic I'm gonna use my empowered spell to re-roll these ones hmm file that one under look look that up too but I'm gonna allow it Oh on a scroll yeah yeah yeah I don't know I know but sure I'm doing a lot of I don't knows yeah and we're just gonna have to roll with it until we see what happened all with it haha so that's 12 14 17 21 there it is 24 29 35 that's almost one bolt from yeah that's almost one shot from there yeah so two of them are completely incinerated well done by the fireball thank you thank you skull it rolled a six the remainder are left bloodied him well guys I just blew through almost all my sorcery points for that water the longfang who is singed but managed to duck and roll but I didn't use a single spell slot nice good ok we move on to the death dogs so this thing is fighting blind so it's gonna attack with its disadvantage biting out at Pluto high getting a 14-2 hit and a big old wow crit turned into a miss nothing mattered mattered can you repost in darkness when you can't see do you need you able to see to do it when a creature misses you with the melee attack ok but I guess I would have disadvantage right yeah you had a disadvantage of the attack what a 11 no okay name so yeah you feel this dog like lurched out towards yours yeah you swing wildly yeah yeah that actually makes sense okay okay I like this I like this I like this okay reeling from the fireball the Noles appear though catching veil outside the darkness and it swings around it kind of pulls itself up with its limber with his limbering lens you can see that it's with its thick claws it can climb up as well just as well as you so it climbs right up and it catches sight of you and it pulls out its flail and it swings it around in a wide arc getting a 19-2 hit yeah and a 12 did no it's gonna be 15 points of piercing damage do I get a knocked off the edge no it's just a tackle it's not trying to play push you yeah as it as it does so though one of the other Noel's follow suit it doesn't climb quite as well as the other so it manages to climb up but it doesn't have enough space to get over to you the other Knoll here these nulls over here don't know what to make of it either so crashes barking missiles however these Knowles clamour climbed up on top of the roof and they just see this blob of darkness and then they see a cat on the other way so they get up on top they see the darkness below them and then they see a little cat and the the other Noel's will will continue to devour that corpse over there divide and conquer they'll you are up okay um I take one look at the Noles on the rooftop and I want to take two shots where I am at the one that's right on top here so I'm just like eating practice when you say divide and conquer you mean focus fire I mean divide if you're all attacking us at once I'd be bad but yes focus fire in the divided egg card oops I just have just to the camera therefore everyone I hope that doesn't make anyone sick I'm gonna hit this guy right here with my two shots and that is a nineteen hit which one are you attacking this guy right on the building here right on the building I'm gonna give him cover but I don't think that that's gonna save him no nothing saves oh yeah could you ignore cover with shooter yeah yeah okay just she loves that first strike in fact I do yes okay that is a 21 damage that slays him outright shooting him off the roof and he tumbles down down the back and I'm gonna take a shot at the other Knoll right on top here okay seventeen that will hit as well nineteen damage and then on by a hair though with Zephyr strike still in effect I'm going to climb down the side of the building into the darkness okay nice just the edge Pluto what are you gonna do there's a there's a Knoll in the building behind us mmm-hmm is it all in the hallway and there's big bad guy yeah but you can't see anything because you're in complete darkness there's still that dog in front of you something here the noise is all around you of them howling and yipping okay and you know that they're they're approaching close and you kind of you sense the light footsteps Aveo stepping into the darkness so you know there's nothing in the immediate area what are you gonna do it and I can't see out of the darkness you know I'm gonna just swing at this dog that I knew is kind of like right around fifteen yeah that will hit 410 damage you feel it whimper and wimp wince and die yeah swing in Mysore blindly in the dark because that's tattoo cuz I'm a safety guy no okay no I can't see anything so I'm not gonna throw anything it's my son Sebastian all right I'm gonna back up a bit oh no it's so dark in the darkest recedes okay okay I want you guys to be able to see and fight I appreciate really I'm gonna cast scorching ray first at this guy up here okay and I have advantage right yeah cuz he can't see you I am gonna give him partial cover so it's gonna be close to easy for him that's okay I about oven accuracy so I'm just gonna crit that's good that I evolved inaccuracy because that was a 1 in a 7 Wow oh good we got an 8 so 16 16 that does it fire burns through butter that's gonna be for 6 damage okay I'm gonna take the other shot at him yep you're good 26 nice 10 damage yeah and with my final shot I line them up and hit him right in the chest with another bolt of fire for there we go I hit him nice for 10 more damage Wow that he's still alive covered in burning plus fire this insane Knoll continues to fight on and it is their turn they clamor off the rooftops now I've left you all exposed you're welcome yeah I really appreciate that I thought I was hindering you but now I'm I regret [Music] no I'm glad I used all my leak down upon the new leaks was prey they don't know what to make of that fiery blackness but they'll deal with it after they've eaten [Laughter] they leave down pulling out their flensing blades and they each attack both these two twice there we go Vale you suffer a critical hit and two critical hits okay I need new dice yep so the two nulls these two nulls leap down from the roof with their blades like a surprise at that yeah and they come down they take other they're these like really rusted flensing almost meathook like blades and the further their first attack it's almost like a synchronized thing because their second attack goes wide and you you basically jump jump jump and then the two it's two blades come in like a pair of scissors and slice deep into your torso oh and if the blades moved any further they might have sliced you in half okay okay you take 30 points of damage thou son of a biscuit [Laughter] I'm comin Baio I'm coming okay run to the darkness Pluto yes forecast via to attack you the first one gets hares a pair of 18 both get twenty two to twenty twos to hit now the other OH another 22 and a 23 oh my new armor there's there's one weak spot and they all found it you take 28 points of damage from all four attacks that hit ow I accept then the longfang attacks what have I done I shouldn't have before it gets a 18 and a 23 max damage so that is going to be 18 points of damage I'm sorry no I'm a strong 16 points I'm pretty bloody and it's lat and as it howls out the with letting out a caning how it comes in with one final bite hey getting a nineteen to hit miss thank goodness new armor I'm going to repost the bite okay - maybe mitigate some of it 23 that hits four 13 as it comes in to bite you it goes wide you twist and you shove your the sword right up through the bottom of its jaw tearing the front of its face open by cutting through the through the snout yeah bang is killed which ones long thing with yeah the crazy naked one yeah in its death howl the other Knolls drop the meat and begin moving towards the rest of you how far can they move they - and they get into the building you have to reach [Music] good that looks safe okay we have cool that's we're at top of the round with Vail all right I need you to make concentration checks for Zephyr strike actually can you make it yeah you need to get a DC to DC 15 concentration on Zeff restricted okay I'm gonna read you my Zephyr story okay yes yes you do okay and I'm going to scurry up towards this building right in front of me away from these two knowles and climb okay up so it's 15 feet up i get 20 or 15 close yep okay so I'm gonna stay there for now I'm gonna take a shot at this gray one right in front of me with advantage from my Zephyr strike yeah get out of here get out of here is a 22 22 is a hit so you leap out of the way as they pull away their blades you utter another spell under your breath Lee and scurry back up the wall and shoot back down and sneak attacks ahead advantage from the zipper shriek 30 damage so he's blown away oh the damage is just dropping tonight ah it's so good I love it love the big numbers my second attack against this that's the first one for four team players tonight isn't it yeah you had a crit earlier but we just forgot about Pluto all I did was kill a dog 27 different so that's that's a head shot it pins him to the ground yeah I need them next round and then why why don't have a little bit of movement so I'm gonna move back furthest I can inside the house I think I can join other Vale from from up here it does not look good there are more Noel's in the next street over Pluto I'm a little surrounded so I'm gonna start swinging we'd be swinging I'm gonna first attack the one behind me sixteen so I did precision strike on that for eleven damage that bloody zit I'm gonna swing him at him again of sixteen again for thirteen damage it cuts him down two quick swipes the first stripe doesn't quite get all the way through the second one does I'm going to action surge and keep on swinging nice and I'm gonna swing at this one right in front of me wild dice come on skull-splitter I've got an idea I need you right now baby me too twenty three yeah ahead there we go okay four twelve okay fourteen to head with your surge of action you cut down a pair of nulls there bloodied remains and in the bottom now there's just tons of nulls that are bleeding out and there's still the old Street gutters that are here you can just hear over the the dinner of it all this sound of the Noles bleed like all their corpses bleeding out into the street and draining down like the drain I got a wildly so I turn around I start just mashing on the one behind me and then I spin he took a couple of shots me but I got my shield up and I start hacking him and then I book it into the shadows is this guy still alive he took if now he's dead okay he killed two okay help me Sebastian shadow save me uh oh em yeah Sebastian steps over in front of Pluto and yells eleven you know should be afraid of the dark and I pull out my wand and I cast cone of fear and it should hit the rest of the Noles it's a 60 footer cone yeah we got it all I scream cold there you go there's my cone Christie cone and how many are still alive one two three four it looks like and they got to make wisdom saving through wisdom saving throw DC 15 they all fail as a keening wail like that of a banshee erupts from the wand sending out waves of psychic fear and that the Noles are crushed under the despair of it flee you fools cool emotional emotionally the the Noles begin running out into the street and as they run into the street you can hear this galloping building forward as suddenly horse hooves crash down the street and run the Noles down the the hooves of about what sound like six riders stop and crush the Noles as they run out into the street they they stop for for a moment and they say and what you hear one of the riders stop I think there I think there were more down the alley over there let's let's take a look I come out but I still have darkness so I guess a mass of darkness comes out from the alleyway and goes wait we've taken care of them down here they their blades point towards the darkness and they say what manner of fiend are you show your face oh my apologies and I snap my fingers and the darkness just kind of goes all up into me it's kind of weird I just like absorb the darkness back inside of me my name is Sebastian Crowe and I'm here to kill Noel's as the darkness fades they see the bloody mess in the street behind you of the corpses of like a dozen Noel's there and the the riders turn to turn to you and say one of one of them all of them are where the stride by mounted upon bart barded steeds so the horses are armored and they have white and silver livery with the mark of a Blazing Sun upon it these are Knights of the silver order they have all their visors are closed they're wearing great helms that mask their faces almost completely and with that and they all have plumes of silver horse hair coming up the top of it and across all of them you can see the blood and that and soot as well on them because two of them on their horses they're the riders are not carrying blades but on their backs are these mounted on the backs of the horses with the riders are these large barrels and there are several cables and hoses that have been attached to the barrel on the back of the on the back of the horse it's probably about the size of a cask a small cask of a like something that you could carry out two of them stacked together and the nozzle ends in the riders instead of carrying swords have these long Lance's but the Lance's instead of being pointed end in an open flange and set underneath like a bayonet on the lance is a long torch of flame so set on the bottom of this nozzle then hosed lance is this is weird torch to there hole and they hold them straight up and you can see that be beside them there seems to be some sort of lever or some other contraption on the side of the lance to burn down the place once again my name is sebastian crow these are my comrades this is veo Sonia from Drakon hime and this is Pluto Jackson of caspia I have a visor too he has a visor to one of the nights opens up his visor and it's one of those styles of Iser where like the middle face just opens up and you see the this this man with this handlebar mustache and he he says well met I'm Virgil of the silver order what are you doing out in these streets here you kill all those Knowles we did indeed we were out here hunting Knowles this is uh we're kind of a cleanup crew for track and mercenaries you treasure hunters what man are you folks out here you can put a yes next to both of those questions but there's probably a long list of things that we are or are not so you're in the middle of our warpath what business do you have waging war in Drakon Heim listen we're about to set another fire break right up up up here there's more Knowles coming this way we ain't got time to talk so if you want to you you and your friends hop on back of the horse we're riding back to our camp it'll be safe there you're welcome to come with us right now because the Knowles they're all up like a nest of bees right now and we got to set another flame barrier before we get going you've been burning a lot of our city today we're a little concerned about that we saw the fire from a little ways away we came to check it out listen we got to get going right now because there's at least two dozen three dozen more Knowles right behind us you can either stay here and leave it to your own devices but I assure you son you're gonna die if you stay here you can come with us now do a weird hold of my hand we're going Hale friend thank you we'll come we don't hold hands like this not often I'm still up on the top and I'm just like do you yeah we're not judgmental folk well we are we're paladin's but not that way I say we go with them for now then take us to your leader so we can talk to them about you burning down our city as you come up on the horse we're doing what needs to be done the city we need to get into the center of the city and we have got no control of the situation in these of twists and little windy streets where ambushes can come out of nowhere so the Lord commanders decreed we're gonna burn the streets on our way to the warpath before we take over temple gate we're headed that way the next couple days we're gonna be taking back this territory will rebuild new but the fire will give us the perfect soil to build up again from listen a lot of people have said that they think they're doing good but they end up being on the bad side of history so you guys better be careful about how much you burned down the city saying this is your riding past among the horses here as you're riding past and as you look out what they have done is they've as you ride down temple road they set up a flame rake so they have dug a dirt trench ahead in the street and they're doing controlled burning of the city block by block and as you ride past you can see there are several of these silver order Knights that have dismounted and they have the big lances and they pull the knot of the lever back on the nozzle and something fires in the tanks on their backs and a gout of flame a lights sending out what looks like a spray of flame and this smell this acrid smell of oil or gas or some kind that's spraying out and sending the building's just burning up in in in tort work saying we're only trying to do what's right for the city take it we're gonna take it back we're doing what's necessary what needs to be done but you could talk to the could talk if you got words to say if you're a local you've been living here Cavalry's here now we're here to help looks like a lot of people have opinions on what's right and by the looks of it looks like this whole thing is heating up in a way that I don't necessarily appreciate I got you snuck a little nuke and paved the what are they from where are they from again yes they're from Illyria Illyria Illyria the area way yep I have to say Virgil for a war hungry pyromaniac I really like your mustache thank you it's a style in Illyria really does me well I believe it gluto I think I still have issues with paladins yeah it's fair but we have to figure out who's ordering this and how we can yeah shut it down let's go talk to the commander cuz I think he'd be the one working maybe talk to you yeah they just don't know the dragon time way they don't they didn't even kick the horse when they came here Virgil did you kick the horse did you guys even kick Thor's or you just burn it you didn't burn the horse yeah he chose you ashes to ashes after all and as you pass by there is a pile of rattling corpses and horses that several the Knights are lighting a flame now there are rattling 's Knowles several fish people other creatures that are all been piled up and they're burning the corpses hate these guys Thanks technically these are monsters or dragon hime but we still have some sort of I feel like I connect I feel like he just burned a bunch of our friends yeah this is like when the log come into like a rain forest that we made friends with in the rain forest yeah Vergil some good you're doing Thanks yeah I don't think that the subtext is being caught here we'll talk later as I look down at the pile of dead friends don't you worry boys the light will shine over Drakon ham again this one's a girl sorry we a cat I can't tell you're a cat lady rude that's where we'll end for tonight and some of our enemies so I'm still I'm I have mixed feelings of over July they just killed Knowles I wouldn't be mad about it but you have to burn all the houses people were living there we can use this Torey advantage we can find a way see I wanna I want to flamethrower I want a horse and a flamethrower yeah come on Virgil hook me
