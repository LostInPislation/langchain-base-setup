no more struck by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed Wolf leave the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the Kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon hein when last we left our heroes they had reinvigorated the Nexus of the shattered tower of the amethyst Academy reactivating the teleportation circle and allowing the mages of the amethyst Academy to enter the tower once more recuperating in a magnificent mansion after a successful mission our heroes were pampered and spoiled and as the magnificent mansion fades around you and you stand once more in the halls of the amethyst Academy what do you do does it does it just fade like without warning like it's good no the unseen servants kind of like drew help you check out okay yeah it's kind of just like standing there like pouring myself some wine and suddenly the bottle and the goblet disappear and I'm like no no no and then I'm just like standing yeah they serve you one last breakfast and are kind of like found there's so much bacon inside the church credit card master I was told that the that this was all-inclusive and the it's it's all-inclusive but as you step out the bacon in your bag fades away magic tragic magic you are you stand now in the main lobby of the amethyst Academy tower that first original chamber where the fountain before the great elevators had collapsed in the tree was falling down on this earth moat and you can see there are two of the mages that you met yesterday that are casting spells towards it and telekinetically lifting it back up and into place and talking to each other in arcane tongues about how to get this back going again and you can see that there are objects being carried about of sensibly by more unseen servants that the mages have gained more control of the sweeping brooms are much more docile now cleaning up the rubble and great doors that you came in have also been changed in an interesting way the majors have brought in a series of canvases and installed this extra set of doors around it almost as if it's like now two sets of doors required to get out of the tower and you can see that they've done similar things of covering things with canvases and repairs wherever the windows were broken and all of the walls that are or anything that would be external to the outside world they've kind of blocked that off and you can actually feel that even in the the 24 hours since you arrived here the air feels cleaner and more breathable like this is actually a habitable space in a way that it was not before oh you guys sure work fast place is a bit of a fixer-upper but it's not without its charm Roni noodles you did a good job as you look look around River comes down from one of the elevators and she greets you all and says good timing I figured that the your accommodations would be up around now what do you think it's it's looking great is this your doing well now that we have the teleportation circle active again we've been able to bring in a lot of other support we're relying at this stage only on members of the Academy who are willing to volunteer to come to Drakon Heim and there's not many but we're very grateful for all that have come so far about almost a dozen guild mages and others are here we have two Archmage's and Eldrick that are here and amazingly almost two dozen apprentices have volunteered as well for extra credit we've been bringing in a few more resources but the council is still a little bit concerned about how much to dedicate towards the tower especially given that the queen of thieves still has one of our resources at large the bomb you mean the box okay cool same same page well that sounds like it's gonna be I pull out my list and I unfurl it I'm like yeah and now that the Academy tower has taken retrieving the bomb back from the queen of thieves it's actually right near the top of the list glad to see we're aligned on that I've been instructed to bring you to the seminar room the Archmage's and Eldrick and a few of the other senior members would like to have a meeting with the three of you immediately are we talking like when you say seminar room is it like a boring seminar like meeting or do you think it's gonna be an exciting meeting I think you'll be very pleased with what they're going to be discussing all right you know meetings sometimes I don't know you didn't go to major school but you know as a prince in kospi oh did you ever have to go to like meetings and then you sit for hours yeah yeah well they talked about like a lot of noble around 100 gold here and blah blah blah and then you just fall asleep and the skirmishers on the east and you like this Lord I'm so bored and then finally when they finally say something of value you've already passed out it's it's a bad time why did I get kicked out of school again many reasons anyway we'll be on our way also just to note the list that you pulled out the bomb was nowhere near the top it was like flip-flop protect the rat prince on your shoulder when you had the list open it's nowhere near the top but we did it for like for that are you saying this oh well no that's you walk away as we walk as we are you is River taking us to the seminar room or which yes she's gonna lead you there then we're like quietly behind her and pluto's quietly just like I'm mocking it's not even near the top of the list I'm like it is now we just won't show her the list don't sure the less she brings you to the elevators and you can see there that there are two of the constructs that the Academy has as Guardians are there with a pair of shovels and they're digging all the rubble out of the out of the elevator shafts and fairing it onto a glimmering disk of arcane force and then they take it and they take it to the front front doors open them up and dump it away they're clearing out all the rubble but the elevator that was working before she leads you into it and uses her mage hand to adjust it up several levels to the Great Hall level where they where she leads you to a smaller chamber that has been cleaned up that is a small well-appointed boardroom with a long desk and set and enough to see probably about 20 people there is a chalkboard in the room as well and as you see directs you to take your seats and seated at the tables there are several of the majors that you met yesterday as and in particular that at the head of the table are eldritch as well as two others that you can recognize by their robes and their high collars and the fact that both of them have a staff of power so they each have one of their own and interestingly enough both of them are Hiles the first is a very kind of aged face looking high elf man with silver hair and he is wearing a cloak of that incorporates both red and purple and gold into the cloak and he's still standing as he holds on to the staff of power beside him is an elven woman with auburn hair and she looks like you couldn't quite place her age with elves you can never tell whether they are 20 or 60 physically looking because they are quite ageless in their in their appearance overall both of them much like Eldrick their eyes glow a solid purple and each of them have clearly several vials of aqua aqua delirium at their at their belts as well the the one a an impish looking familiar coils over his shoulder and there are several other smaller animals throughout the room the familiars of the the Wizards and as they as you enter the room Eldrick stands and says Sebastian veo Pluto welcome please have a seat I take my seat and I take curly off my shoulder and I'm like go go make friends I said don't play with the other familiars perch up on the chair like not sitting down but just almost like crouching in it and are we like at the opposite end of this long table yeah yes and as you take your seats an unseen servant comes up with a platter that has a kettle and several mugs and several cups with tea leaves as well as coffee and danishes oh nice immediately I take the tea and then I'm like well I swear they're danishes yeah like thought that was danishes I mean maybe we'll ask to see if they have any treat they put one in in my bag too just so fast may I introduce you yeah you might be getting this is Archmage arrow theremin thorn an Archmage lesya nether wind they are will be overseeing things from from here they must I must defer to their authority and expertise in these matters welcome to the Tower of Dragon hime Archmage's we just kind of cleared it out yesterday and yeah we're just kind of relaxing this sorry about the mess we're not used to having guests here yet the Archmage era theor smiles and says you've done excellent work very impressive any he turns to society ourselves sila saya we were right to not kill him and said kicking him out was definitely the better answer look at that you you you have a purpose divine purpose they know I'm here then I'm sure a lot of people know in the Academy thought it was swept under the rug by electric anyway and Eldrick replies the council is aware of your predicament Sebastian I've learned a lot since then things have changed I'm Way better than I that don't don't have nearly as many incidents as I used to five rings worth better yeah I have yeah I'm a five ringer now indeed in theory in theory Aerith ear speaks and says indeed you are we would like to have invite you once more to join the ranks of the amethyst Academy hey look at that - do I have to go back to school and pass all the classes I didn't he has so many missing credits yeah I have a lot of missing crimes he's like an honorary Messiah shrugs and says given your extraordinary service and achievements we can give you credit on your courses particularly if what Eldrick says is true and your you have demonstrated skill with magic quite commiserate with other master mages of the amethyst academy thus it only there is no point in you wasting your time with kin trips and low-level magics when you can master already impressive spells awesome that thank you thank you we would like to also extend a high honor to your colleagues veo and pollute oh you have done the amethyst Academy an incredible service and while we cannot induct you as members of the Academy we would like to offer you the respect and do as Friends of the Academy and initiatives to each of you we will award you rings a piece as Friends of the Academy and you will be recognized as such throughout the continent these rings are normally given to those of the master rank and you may visit the Academy or visit any other spellcasters that you may know and fill them with magic that you may protect yourselves and have the boons of the Academy wherever you go for both of these rings are rings of spell story and whenever you visit one of the Academy towers you may petition the majors there for spells that you may bring with you wherever you may go Sebastian we will be granting you five rings one of which will be the one that was your mother's these additional rings will empower your current ring further such that for each ring you wear you your ring may store one additional spell slot so being granted five rings plus the base means that it counts itself so you can store 10 levels worth of spells in your ring of spell storm Oh super rings are they handing me like five rings right now not yet we were planning on having a small ceremony in the hall yes evening yes absolutely thank you furthermore the Academy would like to offer all of you several other services well we are working together we must be clear many of our resources are going towards restoring the tower there is a tremendous amount of work that has to be done to fully restore this tower the teleportation matrix is heavily damaged we are concerned that there may be further mishaps and bringing in more resources it's still not entirely clear how teleportation interacts with the haze and we're still cleaning up the mess from a few apprentices that teleported in this morning oh dear it's very unfortunate so until then we have opted to bar the use of the teleportation circle until we can conclusively determine how we can bypass it even with the staff of power and us kept trying to focus it it is difficult to bring people in via teleportation that said we have many resources here and we are finding more we also need to develop means to traverse between the upper and lower segments of the tower it seems that whatever magics Archmage madera worked in her death have stabilized at least to our best understanding the upper reaches of the tower were not quite sure whether it was her magic or the delirium that is doing this but the fact remains that the tower could collapse at any moment we don't know how long these spells will last and it's remarkable that it's lasted this long finally currently the only means to leave the tower are by imbibing a rather costly and dangerous concoction as you know aqua exper go we have secured the outer doors of the Academy tower and a few apprentices and mages have made the trek and it seems like the Aqua X Burgo holds up to make the trek the trip but the area around the tower is extremely dangerous and it does require using this concoction to exit or enter nevertheless otherwise we are working to cultivate eldritch Lily's on the tower grounds and we have those mages here of alchemical expertise brewing more while you are working with the amethyst Academy we have a selection tool of additional potions and equipment that we can provide you with and we will be providing you each a 500 gold piece stipend at the outset of any mission that you undertake to procure potions and Scrolls from the Academy the potions that are available here are listed here and finally the Academy's stores we have several items in the Academy's stores that we would like to offer you if you have any resources Gold delirium or anything else that you may purchase from us at a significant discount Inn we cannot offer these to you free we simply do not have the resources to do this but if you would like to purchase them we will give you a preferential rate for them should I read these out potions available so we can get aqua delirium aqua exper geo exper go potions of resistance potions of healing potions of grade or healing potions of superior dealing k gottoms augment we need oh and there's also magic items for sale yes so the potions every time you buy one there will always be about d6 of any potion available but there every time you do requisition we'll roll a d6 and on a one Deranian any of them left or sold out yeah okay [Music] the only exception to that is aqua exper go which because the academy needs it to can't leave and go that will always be available okay yeah the magic items yes and these magic items are for sale the academy will give you a preferential rate for them unfortunately they need the resources to go towards the tower so they can't offer them for free so we can buy a movable rods boots of striding and springing there's only one of each of these items available glamoured studded leather armor staff of defense wand of lightning bolts ring of protection cloak of displacement mantle of spell resistance and wings flying oh they're expensive they're expensive and I and I say moment please hey guys do you know much delirium we've collected up to this book oh yeah we should we just like jump it on the table having okay we just start emptying the bag of holding I'm like it just delirium actually furthermore you may procure spell casting services to load up you to charge up your rings of spell story and most spell I've made a list that's in this document that includes spells up to fifth level that are found on the bard sorcerer warlock or wizard spell list that you can load up in your rings of spells story so whenever you come back to the academy tower you can load them up as as you need to what are the constraints around loading other than those made by the spells you can ask for them but they may not be available and if they have a costly component you'll need to provide them okay but beyond that the mages will will cast these spells for you at no charge given your service to the an assist Academy that is so thought thank you Archmage's I just say that our greatest accomplishment so far is just helping you graduate I feel like this is really from giving me the most reward and veo reuniting you with your pigeons was also a huge moment yeah that's true and he's equal see them again actually they probably need to be fed I leave them enough we need a picture of a oh and look at the magic of the pic dobot yeah as long as you bear these rings you will be accepted for safe shelter in any amethyst academy tower anywhere on the continent no jargon time so I mean this once - this is amazing I mean maybe when we're done here it's a good time for us to vacation yeah we can go now without my dad vacation like Wizards wizard but now Sebastian yeah era theory continues we would like to invite you to become a member of the amethyst Academy yeah we in doing so in recognition of your ability to cast 5th level spells we will grant upon you the rank and title master of spell craft and the benefits and responsibilities therein we have deliberated heavily about this the council has decided that should you accept your position with the amethyst academy you will be named high mage of Drakon hime and you will serve in the court of Westham are as the court wizard you are following this assignment you will be at you will need to report to the Lord Commander of Drakon hime immediately I suggest you well I suspect you'll find this a rather natural assignment that's me yeah I thought thank you and this is not something that I will take lightly I will I will do my best to represent the amethyst Academy in West Tamar and hopefully I can come to you guys for for guidance and tips and I'm gonna be pretty new with this thank you thank you for trusting me the amethyst Academy is also prepared to assist the throne of Westham are in its needs for matters of succession we understand as well that accessing Castle Drakon is a matter of paramount importance to the needs of the throne as such this council has decided to entrust the staff of power of Dragon hime to the high mage of Dragon hime for the purposes of the restoration of the throne only then that's okay yeah that that makes sense so once the throne is restored it goes back just to confirm Aerith here continues and Eldrick nods should you you demonstrate great potential the reality is is that typically we only grant the staff of power to a mage who has earned their 9th ring there are less than a dozen such people still alive in the world and the needs of the situation in Drakon Heim demonstrates that we need to create this opportunity one day you may earn your ninth ring and one day you may hold this staff as an Archmage arrow --there seems to have great faith in you you are after all the son of lenin Eventide thank you I'll I'll do my best to earn those rings Messiah and other wins speaks up you understand as a member of the amethyst Academy you will have a series of responsibilities but also a series of privileges absolutely I hope this is easy to follow I've never been one for responsibilities gained greatness is thrust upon recession we must take it up hey guys I'm gonna need some help with this um now as a member of the amethyst Academy and is a master of spellcraft you're part of a group who are custodians of ancient knowledge guardians of the unblinking eye keepers of the pentagram seals Watchers at the Sevenfold gate weavers of the eight winds of magic and speakers of the words which our world is but warded from realms beyond this is your paramount duty and responsibility before all understood I understood like three of that understood or resurgent in light of this responsibility you are to relinquish all claims to mundane property land properties estates noble titles and inheritances in perpetuity in all worlds realms and timelines she can't have stuff in there Noel is stuck inheritances does that include what my mother has left for this this concerns specifically property okay I'd land I I don't really live anywhere right now I've kind of I mean her towers basically I've been squatting there so yeah second you may not hold any rank or authority in any guild church nation organization save for an official appointment at kora as the high mage of Dragon hime which has been appointed to you by the Academy in any world realm or time line your duty and responsibility is first and only to the amethyst Academy I mean Sebastian Crowe court mage sounds better on paper than Sebastian Crowe a somewhat mage Slayer so I also don't really have a title that's worth keeping either so I can accept that as a mage of the amethyst Academy you may not marry or sire children without the explicit sanction of the amethyst Academy in any world realm or timeline so where my left ah no marriage no marriage and you may not sire children without the explicit sanction of the Academy or understand that as a master of spellcraft you may be called upon by the Academy to reproduce with a member of the Academy of our choosing but staff of power can you think about it so you have to give you an answer now yes oh okay sorry I mean to be honest I've been with you for a couple months and nothing's like nothing's really happened so what do you mean what I'm saying is like if the Academy's gonna hook you up like I'll take I just get friends you know what Pluto if you're telling me that I should take it then I'll take it yeah sure further honor I have anybody furthermore you should be aware the promiscuous activities with extra planner entities are expressly forbidden well that was on my bucket list but we'll just cross that one off sure yeah you will be called upon to perform assignments for the amethyst Academy as befits your rank and experience I mean that feels like what I've been doing this whole time anyway so yeah I'll continue through no action or spellcraft of your own you make will you cause deliberate harm to come to the amethyst Academy it's members or apprentices you doesn't do it on purpose it's never been on for this so I accept and you are expected to attend important meetings requiring the attention of the Masters in spots what I was talking about the meetings yeah sure finally wait as a member let us talk about some of your benefits as a member of the Academy we do expect you to spend at least one month per year at one of the Academy strongholds during this time you will provide a spell casting services aid in the creation of magical items instruct apprentices share your magical knowledge with colleagues and participate in the research projects of the Academy professor Crowe is that a benefit or is that like you doing more work well you reside at an Academy stronghold and throughout and while you do know the Academy will always provide you shall afford you assistance and protection as may be necessary that you may do so in kind your living expenses that will be covered while you reside at the mist Academy's grounds and you'll be given private quarters and apartments where you will enjoy the equivalent of a very comfortable to wealthy lifestyle huh okay that's a benefit you will have access to the Academy workshops libraries and laboratories and each month we will also be paying you a stipend of 100 gold pieces times the highest level spell you can cast so you'll receive a monthly stipend - 500 gold pieces living expenses covered I get a fancy pad I get some money to spend and own I can use the lab and strictly they said no relations with extra planner beings that doesn't mean I can't have relations then you came here that's that's correct you can have you are not allowed to marry or have children many members of the amethyst Academy have relationships it's just that you can't get married and you can't have children and you have to recognize that one of the duties that you may have as a member of the Academy our reproductive innate nature because magic is genetic so the Academy does make sure that majors of often likes to play matchmaker between mages with high level skills I would like some say you like option one two three well it depends like we'll jump off that bridge when we get there our dating game yeah we turn it into a dating game if I cast flaming sphere what's your idea of a romantic day finally however you may collaborate with other Academy members including receiving research assistants spell casting services from them in-kind and grant applications are due every three months so if you want to grant for research purposes as well if you spend a month at the Academy Towers you can learn or retrain spells you can bear your rings to invoke the edicts of lumen should you need protection or safe passage from any of the great houses throughout the continent so within Illyria caspia West Jamar and the other nations of the continent any of the Great Houses must recognize your rings and the edicts of lumen and give you safe passage or boarding or shelter should you require it you do have the authority as a master of spellcraft to take on apprentices should you choose to do so and you may petition an audience before the arcane council and you are eligible for nomination to the council as well we grant you the Masters robes symbols and staff which you are expected to bear before the arcane council and we end at the advice of River she told us that robes aren't your style so we've made you a jacket oh that's so thought and river hands you the package it is a midnight purple jacket with golden trim and purple lining and the buttons on it and the the collars bear the crest which of the pentagrams and eyes of the amethyst academy it also functions inside are several small pockets that each have the inscription of a small object on them for this is a robe this functions as a robe of useful objects and it has one of every single patch look beautiful and as this happens I use prestidigitation to make a small musical noise of trumpets they also have a scarf for you it is a purple scarf it is a scarf of billowing Saurus it billows dramatically I have handed me the staff now as well we will be presenting that to you this okay so I just have the the new jacket on and a billowing purple scarf nice thing else and see by the way didn't say anything about relations so just run it if you ever want to do like a Caspian grant research thing so no cool you mean a Caspian partnership [Laughter] so this evening we will have a formal gathering in the Great Hall and present you at the state of power and your rings welcome back to the amethyst Academy thank you you won't regret this Eldar continues the academy goals now it will take us a great deal of time to secure the tower we will support the throne of westrom are in its succession crisis furthermore we would like to collaborate in securing the situation in the city particularly dealing with the queen of Thieves yeah we we have a few ideas if I may present those to you certainly actually before I do that there are a couple other things that I would like to do well I have all of you here first of all if you would like to appoint a new librarian the previous one is no longer going to be functioning as a librarian I do have this it's this mod for the librarian I can't get much use out of it but I thought if you're looking for somebody to work at this tower I would like to nominate River as a candidate for a high ranking position within this tower if she so chooses to take that well we will be granting River her 5th ring this evening as well oh so I can't take her as an apprentice because now we're even okay fair we also have a lot of delirium are we still on terms of selling that to you certainly cool could we the harvesting of the large shards that are growing around the tower and the tower grounds are difficult and we are in need of smaller pieces because as much as we can get we will need we would be very interested in mounting an expedition to the crater as well yeah we haven't been there yet that is also on the list top of the list actually yes yeah we want the crater adventure we we have a bit of an idea so we have a lot of connections that we've made in the city during this time with Vale representing the hooded lanterns now as the Lord Commander we have them on our side Pluto here is a prince of caspia and with the silver order turning their backs on us we thought it might be a good time to send a message to caspia and ask for their aid in dragon hime against the queen of Thieves we also have another Caspian member here in the city Jupiter Jones who we currently have the hooded lanterns out searching for we're hoping that we can have a conversation with him and get him in his men on our side as well and what is Caspi is position on the city of Drakon hymen um I think caspia and dragon hime both benefit from Jack and I'm being a restored City let's make no mistake again elder continues and the other Archmage's not an agreement we're not certain that we will be able to restore dragon hime to being a city and in fact era theer continues having just been here now for a day that seems like a daunting task but that we have secured the Academy tower and that we are here means that there's a chance I believe that we may be able to use the Delirium and the resources of the tower to potentially create some level of arcane control over the city we may also be able to use the Delirium and the meteoric iron to create guardians of that would help us maintain order that would not pose the risks that living beings do nor involve the questionable use of undead creatures either we do have a couple other tricks up our sleeve as well there are cards that we were a little nervous to bring to the table before we get to the nervous cards I will also say we we've recently discovered that acquaintance Aveo lives in which cross hmm and we may be able to get him to bring some reinforcements for extra magic support this Lord Eric yes I haven't spoken to him since I was very young but I know he'll recognize me and I know he'll at least communicate with us about our dire situation here Lord Eric does still reside in which cross he's been a longtime friend of the Academy the we can certainly contact him and he may be an excellent resource for you and the hooded lanterns in rallying more support from the noble houses of Westham are to send more troops to the city and lastly we we have two other potential forces that might be of use specifically in the battle against the queen of Thieves although unlikely we happen to have procured an alliance with the rat links other cities the mages all are aargh at what they're friendly people we have deceived the rattling z' into believing that we are their gods and in doing so they have been doing our bidding whenever we have asked it upon them and all that they have asked for in return is the flesh of our enemies is the flesh of our enemies hmm which is also good use them as a driving force against the Queen's men I have a suggestion it says River yeah I've heard an old rumor an old story told around dragon hime of a piper that used to dwell in the city that had a magic pipe that could let him control rats I wonder if we could still find it and if it would work on the rattling River you're a genius that's worth a try we already have them kind of under our thumb a little bit little bit what they need real yeah really there should be drilling in but I think they're kind of like the kind of like a bomb but if we can point them in the right direction and send them in the right way and if we can get this item that you speak of that might help we also have the fish people in the sewers who invited us to meet with their Dutchess again there's more general commotion amongst the mages in the end one of those there's fish people living in Drakon hime listen you guys have been up in your towers for years on the ground floor making the connections getting the info do you want to know how we first got into dragon hime and what this is so like many of the majors begin to already debate saying I knew it my theory was absolutely correct the people of the city are mutating into horrible creatures no that's completely ridiculous clearly the crazy monsters are spawned by the Hays directly and there's an argument between the mages as they start arguing over where the monsters are coming from insults start throwing around and someone pulls out a notebook and says I prove it I have the theory the science is true hold on wait wait I guess a minor illusion sound with a a whistle as loud as a scream and I stand up well actually we have a potential here for a large army doesn't matter how they were made the point is that the rattling x' and the fish people might be willing to cooperate with us Elric says well on the other hand although them the blue does raise a good point if the creatures are spontaneously generated by the haze and then the conversation going with a yes that you you must understand we wished we wished to research and understand what has happened here and now we have the perfect place to observe it directly and safely for many of our best best minds the majors here for the rings and all of their power not many of us are willing to risk our lives but we are fascinated and we are willing to offer our minds and our skills very few of us are battle mages like you that's why you are such a valuable resource Sebastian your field experience outstrips many of the others here well then take it from me as somebody who has been out in Drakon Heim for months now and has had to go through the sewers had to go through the haze had to deal with abominations that some of you may have never encountered in your lives that it might be in our best interest to take every Ally that we can get especially against somebody as cunning as the queen of Thieves now one thing to keep in mind I want to put this forward as your Lord Commander is that there have been people in Drakon hime who have been risking their lives for years a Cade the hood lanterns without magic so I just want to put it out there they deserve just as most respect as anyone who goes out into Drakon hime so just make sure as we make this partnership happen that they get their due diligence in terms of the recognition for keeping the city safe aro --there speaks up and says we wouldn't have it any other way we just can't force army our members into the field against their will of course and i don't expect anyone to go out there against their will but I think with the bravery being put out there by the lanterns it is something to be said for what they're doing out there indeed we will we can arrange if you wish if you would like to provide have the Academy dedicate more resources what we can spare to the hooded lanterns we could send potions or provisions of any kind that we can spare so if that'd that is fair we can do that that will stretch our resources a bit thin but we can send those things to thee to yours troops yes we we're not asking for anything but anything that you can provide will help us for sure in our partnership well it should be noted that the former person who was supplying the hooded lanterns with health potions is a pile of mush upstairs now so it would be it would probably be helpful if we could at least the wounded of the hooded lanterns taken care of and everybody ready for battle we can do this we can provide this thank you so the other thing that we cannot risk is infiltration of this tower by the queen of Thieves she has demonstrated the ability to outwit and outplay all of us in the past and thus our other reason for not wanting to allow any of our mages into the field is so that the risk of their impersonation is greatly reduced for if this Academy is infiltrated by an entity like the queen of Thieves it could be very disastrous I'm just gonna throw an idea out there because with when it comes to the queen of Thieves I mean I'm open to any ideas because everything that we've tried so far has not worked out well and it's blown up in our faces and I'm sure the last thing we want is for anything else to blow up in our faces sister because she has a bomb yeah she has that bomb I can't slow up another face now you know thank you thank you all my time is there any way that we can set what an anti-magic field around the tower I don't know if you guys have that within you but she's been infiltrating us by posing as other people or by sending people that are mind controlled one of the other main is wait did you just talk about building an anti-magic field around the entire Tower I don't an anti-magic field of that size I mean that could collapse reality itself are you crazy what about just in like the front entrance you can't walk through here if you're impersonating a different person and the mages begin arguing about the sizes and dimensions of a possible anti magic field like no no no I tell you it's possible it's possible to generate an anti magic field of at least 10 feet in diameter and sustain I have seen other mages do it it is is incredible spell but putting one of those in a personal permanent occasion sustaining that indefinitely the kind of magic energies will be required to do that are you they just go back and forth begin arguing about the logistics of actually trying to set up or whistle again can you I don't know do something to my goggles so that maybe I can I can I can detect oh the queen of Thieves if she's posing yeah you would actually have to wear them for the first time I wore them how many times your eyes got burned we can the components of it are expensive and I can and all on here I believe knows the spell but if you wish Albrecht rips you off on the blue of bearded mage there and says do you do you know the spell says yes requires a small tincture and concoction but I could provide you in your ring of spell storing with the true seeing spell oh I mean that's also yeah you're not gonna build them into my goggles I mean we could construct an item like that but that would take weeks to build hmm I'll give you one week and a bunch of delirium and a whole bunch of delirium I mean not all that lyrium torture which you also have to pass for well we could build something like that it's possible yes we could use the delirium as a focusing lens you'd be able to hold it up it would be possible yes a magnifying glass armonica am article that you predict we would need to do it it'd look great on Mortimer Bigsby yes indeed we could build a gem of seeing to do so we would need probably about 5,000 gold pieces worth of delirium and two weeks but we could potentially build it we have the expertise here to do something like that do you think that will help us with finding the queen of use well if the designs of it are such basically the this would be a gem of seeing built into your goggles and it would have three charges that as an action you would be able to expend a charge and for ten minutes you would have true sight sounds good one more question for all of these they they could build that if if you want any yep if you if you have the money in resources okay well you can take the crystals that are upstairs that we haven't harvested yet there are crystals upstairs you can have all of them all of those large star credit that takes time so the harvest to say those large crystals we have plans for them and built and they're not suitable like you can't cut apart a delirium crystal into smaller components so it requires smaller ones and any way to channel that energy okay and so the Academy now is claiming those large charts here's here's the last question then before we get into how much delirium we have and whether we can build goggles of true seeing which will come in very handy now as an alternative we can cast the spell for you into your ring of spell story we can also provide we also have members that know spells like detect magic and detect thoughts detect magic see invisibility so there are lower level spells that we could provide you with that you could take his tools in the field as well okay yeah my last question for the Council of mages here with us going into the field and us being me being one of the representatives from the amethyst Academy who will be actually in the field against the queen of Thieves she has a bomb that you all helped make mm-hmm indeed in theory would you happen to have any magic or knowledge in a way that we could locate the bomb hone in on its signal to help us what I'm hoping for we can try but we have already tried to locate the queen of Thieves and she is we believe that she is using a stronghold which was in Drakon Heim for some time that has been warded against prying eyes we can equip you with the resources to scry but locating the queen of Thieves directly has proved improved difficult we have built more bombs you should know this I would suggest you leave them in your hands until such a time that it feels appropriate not that I don't trust me and my friends but as long as the queen of Thieves is out there she is she's been a step ahead of us this whole time now I don't necessarily need to scry and find the queen of Thieves but I think what's most important if we are going to approach the queen of Thieves in open battle it makes sense that we send a small force in a dragon force if you will to retrieve the bomb to make sure that that doesn't go off and indeed we will a fit outfit you with spells resources everything that we can provide to do that and if there is any way that we can assist with our other spell casting just let we can do that we have already tried to spy on the Queen these and we cannot we are not certain of her location although to our best guests she is still occupying that stronghold around buckle down row in the south part of the city mayhaps we can draw her out into open battle or trick her in some way but we'll have to consider this carefully as well the mirror from Sebastian's mother where is being kept right now we have brought it here is it safe to go into the mirror again was it ever I mean it when it started dripping black goo that that was the problem no no it is not Oh see look at that it all cleared up that's what he said to wait but there was quite a lot of it do you have it is it with you this is secure it's proven to make a interesting weapon in the past we found that Oh would you like some more I mean yes not with Pluto hey I'll be really careful with mine I was I'd like to kind of think of myself as a pioneer in the black goo experimentation do we doing a whole thing I really spearheaded the whole campaign on how to apply black goo to weaponized now give credit where credit's due Sten also had an equal part we have we did collect it there are six vials of it total that is all there is to have you in your research on the black goo in one instance it drew Undead in another instance it melted melted a person is it more leaning towards the melty goo or the undead summoning goo it is like ambrosia to undead creatures so if you leave it open it will attract undead creatures they can detect it they are drawn towards it like moths to a flame and it is incredibly fatal to touch or consume yeah so it's like a little bit of both great it's like a double-edged sword I can think of so many reasons to use six files two vials throw it all in the it's two miles I have two and Bale has two I assume are you giving me two you do not think it is wise for you to take all six vials don't give you one Sebastian one because I mean if you find a good use for it let us know but we will safeguard the remainder for now okay okay fair well we may need that mirror do you think the black goo if poured onto a delirium bomb will undo and disintegrate the bombs where are you drawing this room you've been a master for like there's only one way to know what's the worst that could happen very bad thing don't answer that oh we're gonna pour black goo on the ball you haven't known each other we have not tried that and immediately another argument branched out a bunch of mages one that's a I guarantee you it could open up the portal to the shadow cell drawing in shadowy energy and destroying all life from miles around no no I think that's completely ridiculous I think it would completely destroy and disintegrate the delirium forming a new form your rowdy bunch aren't you they're very excited you must understand that these mages are amongst the most those that are most fascinated with what has happened in tracking hime and all of them are a little bit on the crazy side to say they must learn currently all it's good company well meeting adjourned as West amar what are you what's your title now then master spell caster of West tomorrow before we think before this meeting is over eldritch says the Archmage's and I would like to meet with you privately Sebastian all the fun jokes that I just made they were very just that I was having a bit of fun I'm taking this super seriously come on Vale Vale we leave yeah well ghost we'll go wait outside okay the door either side we'll go wait outside the door oh do I get a private thing [Music] congratulations are in order first of all thank you we need to know for certain that your loyalty will be first and foremost to the amethyst Academy from what I've seen the amethyst Academy aligns with what I hope to accomplish in Drakon high so as the representative here in Drakon hime I think that it works the your friend Vale is Lord Commander of Dragon Diamond yes Pluto Jackson is a prince of caspia yes the former queen of Dragon hime Lenore is a Caspian woman and we understand that there is some relation between the Caspian Prince and the throne of Dragon hime do you know this I do what can you tell us about it it's my understanding that Pluto Jackson's cousin or nephew might be nephew has a claim to tracking home with him being as young as he is Pluto Jackson himself is in line to take the throne until such a time that the heir to the throne becomes of age and I I'm just gonna tell you right now that I don't see this as a bad thing neither do we era Theron nods to Lucia she says we would very much like to see this George installed as the ruler of track and I'm as a child he will be very easy to manipulate and your friend pollute Oh Jackson does not appear to be too bright either this puts the Academy in an excellent position to secure our hold Holdings over dragon hime and will mean that we can can negotiate with them in good faith to secure complete ownership and control over the supply of delirium this is our most important objective in the city do you understand this I do we respect the throne of West Amara but being able to wield the throne as a puppet of the Academy could be the best advance for the Academy in hundreds of years you've put us in a very excellent position and we hope that we will get you will continue to use your friendship with Lord Bluto Jackson and Visenya to make sure that the Academy's position in Drakon haim is secured I'll make sure that the Academy's position is secured here in Drakon Haim and I will see to it that Pluto Jackson is put on the throne to represent George until such a time as he comes of age but I wouldn't underestimate what Pluto Jackson has to offer and I will say although he might not always make the best decisions [Music] and he has been known to be slightly foolhardy at times he's a very courageous a very honest and a very well-spoken individual who has at times shown that he can be an exceptional leader we don't doubt that those traits make him an excellent puppet an event to end the fact that his nephew is has not come of age and has not learned how to be a ruler from anyone else means that we are in a perfect position to have their ear if the the biggest issue that we will have in the months and years to come with the other nations of the continent will be securing the Academy's control over Delirium it is an incredibly valuable resource you should know that we believe that this is not the first time a meteor of this nature has collided with our world we believe that it has happened at least one other time at the birth of sorcery this delirium has been found on our world before in very small amounts we don't understand where it comes from yet but it's magical potential is unlike anything else and those that don't understand the workings of magic cannot be allowed to control it I understand that just moving forward can we find a better word than poppet makes it sound very ominous when you say it like that and I will say that um Pluto Jackson listens to my advice that puts us in the advantageous position that you want through friendship through kindness and through loyalty putting Pluto Jackson on the throne and putting me next to him means that I representing the amethyst Academy and their goals we'll be able to talk to Pluto and sway him in the directions that we need to [Music] but it will be because we think it's in the best interest of the world and for Westham are you're very well spoken Sebastian says El Ricky but remember as a member of the Academy it is important that you have your duty to the Academy first then to Westham are on your friends we don't expect you to betray your friends that's not the way we operate and the Archmage speaks out of turn in calling Pluto Jackson a public puppet you can use your friendship in an honest way but we need this to be an advantageous situation for the Academy there's a lot more at stake than just the kingdom of West Ammar as long as you understand that you can never ask me to betray my friendship with these two then we have in agreeance we expect you to navigate that if you want to maintain your relationship with them and your responsibilities to the Academy you will need to use your skills to manage that understood you've been granted a great deal of privileges you've also accomplished a great deal for this Academy don't waste it yes sir go get your friends it's alright yeah maybe that's where we should take a break yeah yeah let's do that so we're gonna go have our little break and their end you will all then have a little fancy feast again as you are awarded your rings when we come back they will be very excited for Fancy Feast awesome and we're back from our break we have had our short rest and the feasting is

reputation for causing incidents that's fine that's fine I like turn away and I'm like a little wounded by that and I just start looking around and I'm like pointing at random apprentices being like

new apartment they are apart he's got a really nice couch in the apartment yeah that'll be really nice tree to stay on yeah yeah I call the apartment is is a well-appointed place with it with its own own washing room it has a small living quarters and study and they've left the mirror in the apartment and then you have your own private bedchamber and dressing room as well and as you come in there's a there's an unseen servant that lives in your apartment that is going to be your Butler I open up like the closet and it's just full of like 40 of the same coat and shirt and pants and I'm just like excellent this is what I wanted oh and eight more pairs of goggles nice they're not the ones that you're wearing I know these are the ones my dad gave me ya know you're ever seen like those

this place for you cat fur everywhere when you get Pluto I'm just like yeah well we'll keep it on to redecorate I would now be a good time for me to talk to my mother now that we're winding down for the evening hmm yes guys are you sure you want to be here for this I have no idea what where did you get the food oh is that popcorn where did you get food oh are you here to watch the cancer and brought it over I reach over and I start eating your food as well but like twice as fast this doctor your mom okay this is weird with an audience I've never done this before yeah okay all right um are you like are you doing magic on your own we need to channel am i cheering too loud is that what's happening I know you're yeah a little I pull the mirror over and I sit in front of the mirror and I'm gonna start working on casting contact other plain okay there is a there are ritual supplies in your chamber and there if there is like a all the materials to do like small-scale spell casting privately and you're in your apartment are here so you can kind of like clear in fact when you pull the rug up there's a there's a magic circle basically like everyone knows that all the mages do private things are no rooms I imagine that uh like I pull the mirror up right outside the magic circle I sit in them I have like all these components and candles around me I've like unlike lighting candles and then it's all verbal components so what I would I imagine I'm doing is I actually just sit there and my eyes go black mm-hmm and I actually start to like levitate a few feet off the ground in like my sitting position you and you got to use the ritual book in the spa and the book like floats up in the air yeah handles and stuff are starting to like slowed and rotate around me and I'm just there in like the middle of the room hovering being okay as you cast the spell make an intelligent saving throw I want the verbal component just to be you yelling mom you succeed and are not rendered insane hey that's a win me yelling mom starts to set even though it's spelt the same forwards and backwards it starts to sound like it's like in Reverse yeah mom that starts coming out instead I guess okay creepy your contact other plain spell you feel this image come into your mind Vail and Pluto you see this shade like figure appear come stepping forward out of the mirror in front of Sebastian and she is she is unmistakably the one resembles the simulacrum that you encountered before it is Lenna theeven tide and the again she is an elven woman with this long kind of strawberry blonde like hair and almost these deep shadows under her eyes and dark blue lips and she is wearing a black robe and has an amulet of gold around her neck but as otherwise rather simply adorned there's rather thick freckles on her cheeks as well but she and there's a soft purple glow in her eyes and the nature of the spell allows her to say more than contact other plane would normally allow her to do so but you must still ask the questions she says hello Sebastian I've been waiting for you for a long time I'm sure you have questions so ask away I want to start by saying that I'm very excited to finally meet you it's been a long time coming and I'm supposed to ask questions that's how this works there's so much that I want to tell you there's so much that I want to say ask her your middle name are you like I'm just kind of like behind but like watching okay first question was it intentional that you gave up your life in childbirth to create me yes it was can I ask what purpose you had behind that I wanted to give you the greatest gift that a mother could give their child life power did you sacrifice yourself to give your power to me no where did my power come from it comes from the nether the Shadowlands realms beyond bound in blood does it have anything to do with the demon in your mere dimension no why do you have a statue of the demon in you the mere dimension he taught me many things he seems to have a high cost to deed he does did you know that a delirium meteor was going to strike dragon hype I suspected it would I feel like you've been leading me this whole time to discover some sort of truth um where was question number four sure you get two more okay a fight you go one you only go yeah I think it was 5 you get 5 so you go one more okay you can always talk to me again tomorrow how would I learn more about why the meteor hit dragon hime what is my best course of action to uncover that truth the crater thank you be safe I love you I love you too Sebastian oh hi mama carrot top oh that was nice did they hear do you would you have wanted them to I I imagine that the way that it worked is that I was speaking out loud but they might not have heard the answers yeah I imagine that and then I imagine that as she fades everything kind of lowers back to the ground and then I opened my eyes again that was freaky your mom your mom was here and you were talking to her and guys I just met my mom for the first time magic oh we gotta ask her about those simulacrum yeah yeah I can contact her again tomorrow I make them I need to go to the crater at some point did she say something about it that's where I'm gonna find answers as to why the meteorite what it is why it's here why it hit dragon hime there's something connecting all of this also my mom did sacrifice herself so that I could have power power I don't know I feel like do I seem more powerful than other spellcasters not not really I mean he explored more than them that I mean that might account for why I have so many incidences because maybe I have more pent-up power I don't I don't know the demon gave my mom answers for high price but does he have your soul I didn't get to ask that I only got five questions I'm gonna have to ask more tomorrow I'm gonna start working out a list of questions mom I was I was a little caught off guard I realized as I finished casting the spell that I don't think I was fully prepared to meet my mother for the first time and have her be like yo ask me five questions I thought we were just gonna have like a chat all night about my childhood it's not gonna work that way so I don't think I'm ever gonna really get to meet my mother but in a way I got to talk to her and at least I can figure some things out maybe you can ask her questions for forever yeah eventually I'll expect how's your dad she met your dad yeah like what was my third birthday thing no way you just tell her about your third birthday yeah can you I think I mean she can't so many questions what if you just sat there for an hour and just talked to her you told her all about your day and like you just bend she might have seen it though I mean being all spirit nice Oh next time I'll ask her if she has been watching over me yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway guys I was nice I'm uh I'm gonna go to bed now night snack before we sleep can we lay on the floor in a circle yeah on the summoning circle thing like looking at the super comfortable bed like the most comfortable bed that I've seen since arriving in Drakon hime and I look at you guys I mean go into bed if you want I mean if you don't want to hang out with us if you know no I mean all the bed no y'all just go in the bed yeah when you want to cuddle with gluto and me I call middle all right guys everybody it's it's a pretty big bad I mean actually I'm at the end of the bed and I actually that's it first they're gonna like massage the blankets it's a big bed right the way you yeah like in the morning the there's a group of apprentices and the Archmage's that are going to set out from the tower because Archmage's era thea and messiah are going to are going to travel on foot outside the city then travel further because none of them want to try actually no one wants to try to heliport again after what happened yesterday a bunch of people are still speaking about it and it does not sound like it was good yeah maybe we should hold at some point a like memoriam for the apprentices that tried to teleport in yeah so you you hear that there's bustling that the academy is going to start sending some caravans in to bring in supplies on foot it's not as easy but now it's worthwhile for them to do it because they actually have a proper base of operations so they will provide you with a dose of aqua exper go and you can head out with this caravan now if you would like to head back you guys want to head back to the barracks yeah I think umm if I want to send a letter quickly to Eric can I send it back with another Caravan or is it faster to get somebody to send em you you you ain't gotta use that snail mail no more they can send you they can use magic to send letters yeah yeah so if you do want to contact anybody river is being appointed to be at the academy barracks and she can send message she knows sending and she can send messages out if you need to contact someone magically and so the the academy or as long as you can describe who you want to talk to she can cast sending and contact them sorry she's at she's gonna be at the barracks she's gonna be stationed there okay and then Eldrick is going to stay at the academy tower if you guys want and what do you want to charge up your rings with because you have to come back to the Academy power to do that okay and if they're selling you on the list that you don't that you that isn't there that you can think of you can ask me and we'll roll to find out if someone there knows it but that's basically amongst the majors that are staying at the Academy tower those are the spells that they have available to between them and as I said it's a smorgasbord of spells on from the bard sorcerer warlock and wizard spell list so your ring can store a total of five levels worth of spells part of me just wants to take five shields and just just just just keep running around and doing whatever I just do normally okay but I do like an enlarged reduce okay so maybe a one enlarge reduce to shields mm-hmm and a healing word okay they'll I think I'm gonna take a dimension door okay so forth and a shield nice for now Sebastian I'm gonna take cone of cold okay greater invisibility before you commit to cone of cold you know that cone of cold is in the staff of power yeah that's a good call yeah I'm taking greater invisibility and ferry fire okay which is five and then I got five more [Music] and might banishment mm-hmm and I get one more so we will do how many levels here I get one more yes well so I'm the only words great word yeah we works great making the bard work overtime yeah yeah come on buddy chop-chop sing those songs get through it come on quicker faster play faster no cool all righty so yeah you had those in your rings of spell storing and can use them whenever you would like to magic magic there's so many spells now I figure that I should probably be able to teleport at some point you know she's thinking about situations I've been in that sounds like a good idea you basically teleport though all the time as far as I know you're teleporting imagine if I run really far and then I teleport yeah the app with the Archmage's shield guardians and the caravan of mages it is quite the procession going back through the streets of tracking hime towards Shepherds gate as you you travel back in the safety of this group without incident and arrived at Shepherds gate where the Archmage's give their respect and continue on their journey away and it you are left with River and her guardian and you are and the horns blare of the hooded lanterns and the flags rise up and you hear them all crying out the Lord Commander has returned open the gates and you come into the the barracks Elias drexell rushes out to welcome you and says Lord Commander welcome back hello it's been a lot happening there's a lot to discuss we have a lot to discuss as well I had some news I do too I hope you have good news because I don't have any pretty good news no good news wait wait what no good news I'm sorry I don't have much in the way of good news things have happened while you've been gone and the situation is well we've got a lot to think about it's three days so that can happen in three days yes it's true okay any word on Jupiter uh to a private chamber alrighty nobody said anything about my new coat it looks so good don't worry I didn't get a new coat as you go commander says where'd you get the new coat Oh Sebastian Crowe Master spellcaster impressive is that those are the symbols of the Academy did they you are you've been an Academy member this entire time haven't you no I haven't it was an ex Academy they just graduated no II I just graduated finally an ex ex Academy member yeah thanks ex Academy congratulations I suppose it's a really nice jacket thank you that an impressive stick yeah it's shiny we got a batch over our heads I was the closest River River explains as I think the Lord Commander is trying to explain lieutenant commander the amethyst Academy has appointed master Sebastian Crowe here as the high mage of Drakon Heim and he will be serving as the Academy's representative to the throne of West amar no big deal don't worry about it well you all are moving up in the world glad to see it I mean we do we do do a lot for its I mean it's you head back to the the the war rooms and a series of messages arrive and the and Elias Drexel says there's a few things that you should be aware of first first of all how would you like to proceed Lord Commander would you like to get updates from us or shall you let us in on what you've been up to first mm I like a full report from you all first and then we'll let you know how that relates to what we did lieutenant sir I don't know I found in your bag I was they open at the house snacks in his van yeah you snacks in your bags so I just got in your bag to get sacked also we'd like some snacks also the Lord straighter demands to man snacks alright the first we shouldn't be a first order radius here is that we as asked we have sent runners out to contact other noble families and we sent out groups of Scouts to locate Jupiter Jones and we've found him and he's here that's good news that's great where is he he's at the at the barracks we didn't give you here here here at the barracks kitchen we were gonna wait to bring him in when you're ready to see him I mean that's good news have a snack yourself did well and the he claims that he may know the location of one of the remaining marks of a small Council which one well from he he believes that he knows the location of the Lord Mayor's circlet well then we have to get him in here is that Roger Guildhall the Lord the Lord Mayor his offices were at the old town assembly chambers hmm he knows where it is it spot he claims - we're gonna need Ignatius for this good call hmm but there is some other news there's been a decree by the high arc of the Church of the sacred fire price price and it's well lay it out the decree says this he produces the letter that has the seal of the hierarchy I take it they've been sending these all out all over and it says West Omar has turned from the light and seeks to cloak itself in shadow and ruin a terrible curse grips those who would tell you they are fighting for your city your nation but this cursed has gripped their crown of West Ammar itself the high arc has dispatched a crusading force to the city of Drakon Haim with orders to burn it to the ground okay so war is coming - dragon I'm the hierarch is also declared declared Lucretia Matthias and outlaw and heretic it's okay with us it's getting better okay can you repeat the first part again about the burning the city to the ground they've dispatched they've they begin begun assembling an army of soldiers for the higher arc and Illyria no longer recognize the severity is the the serenity of tomorrow they have effectively decrypt the declared that the throne is a dead lineage and that the kingdom itself no longer exists we have to come forward with our new evidence we have to show that the lineage still stands yes whether it be a new way they think regard decree is said that the lineage is invalid that the corruption of lenore has branded the line and that effectively the they said that LaVon castle line is tainted irrevocably this cannot stand yeah that's that's absolutely insane and this game we have by us represent they're sending an army we had then we need an army to fight back we need to show them that not only is Dragan Haim have lineage but it can stand on its own and we can rebuild it I think their choices are made out of fear and misunderstanding of what dragon I'm currently is which is just more of like a modge podge of okay the situation has grown dire because now the soldiers of the silver order that are still here have begun engaging in skirmishes with our own soldiers not only that but there have been open battles as well between the silver order and the followers of the falling fire while you were gone there was a battle at the Cathedral Square between the silver order and the followers of the falling fire and the silver order was defeated the silicone order was defeated oh no that's how much good bad we don't know they didn't have the silver order a Soviet regaining his strength after the previous engagements that they helped us with but the falling fire has claimed the grand Cathedral st. Patricia oops hmm okay so it is apparently the initial reports from the scouts indicate that the silver that the silver order was defeated because several of its members defected to the falling fire there is a Matt there is more and more schism occurring within the church and it's spilling over into Drakon hi how about the commanders from the silver order are they still at their posts it seems to be yes it sounds like this also could be some kind of political play overseas I mean if they're coming in like who's their enemy is it the silver order is it the the hierarchy are they are they aiming to like just destroy dragon time are they here to kill one thing like witches are they trying to just get rid of the falling fire maybe if we lead the following fire out or sure our our disdain our mutual disdain for the falling fire I think it's past that church is effectively the monarch of Illyria as well which means that in making this power play Illyria could be trying to claim the lands of West Ammar as part of its nation well that can't stand this is a caspia wait wait I want to take it no no no but you have a rightful claim to the throne my isn't the the throne has a lineage I can't just be thrown in as a bargaining chip to this higher monarchy of divine power we need to clean up in and you have the papers that say that this is true if they're passing this statement around we need to we need to make our own statement and I think it's important that we we need to talk to your father yeah okay because this caspia going to press its claim and has to capture my father and it could mean war between Caspian and Illyria for dragon hunt it's been a long time it's been a long time coming yeah Brinkley it's been leading up to this and I think if the lineage of the Von Kessel's leads us to caspia then we should stand by them but I think we need to get them here and the Lord Commander if we involve the Caspian 's Westham our dragon Heim could just as easily become a vassal of caspia as well but we have like better parties and stuff when when you go to war you call on your allies caspia and drackett Heim and Wes were all Caspian Westham are our United through marriage and blood relation we have no relation with Illyria so calling upon our allies in caspia is a play to aid Westham are in a time of war to help push the lineage that we know is there against an enemy i think sticking with the Allies that we have rather than trying to reason with men who have already made decisions about wanting to take over this world it's time to really stand with the people who are gonna stand with us and if dragon Heim becomes a connection to caspia a second caspia well I mean we got to fill it with someone but I think that we can't just stand aside and be on our own we're gonna lose that way and we're gonna lose everything that we fought for if we don't choose a side we need to rally to do this which means we have to act quickly yes it will take the silver order and the church time to muster their army my best guess is one month maybe two before they're able to march up their forces here to the city itself hmm they'll find it quite inhospitable as well given the situation during the Civil War there was an army that did attempt to retake the city but the haze was thicker then and it was a disaster this is a difficult city to take with it doesn't mean that they can't block hate it with the help of the amethyst Academy we now have more tools to exist within dragga time and deal with the haze that we could give our soldiers giving us a benefit over the opposing forces indeed and if we can take Castle drakon relocate the threat of the crown itself we can make it deliberate show that the power of Dragon I'm still exists we're also working on getting not just yes they could blockade but with the amethyst Academy's help you don't need to walk out of dragon home we can teleport not a dragon home once the certain one specific measures are reached yes we can open up a teleportation circle that's going to take some time though the amethyst Academy is gonna be working on that for a couple months as well in the meantime alicat warfare we have Delirium weapons too we do that's something that they don't even need to get in into the city to these once they set up a camp we could blow up their camps see yeah we have a lot of things in our pocket right now there's a there's a lot that we can do we have options and we sounds like we have a little bit of time to do so yeah I mean and I don't want to let diplomacy fail yet there's got to be a way we can find out more about what's actually behind this statement there's there's got to be some underlying there's no reason why they would go this far so so suddenly especially if the the root cause might be just the the falling fire if we can help so let's lay this all out there's an army that is approaching that it's going to be approaching dragonhide mm-hmm we need to rally our own forces yeah River mentioned an item that we might be able to obtain to help us rally more more forces if you know what I mean wink flutes yeah hi we need to get the pipe Jupiter Jones and his men might also know the whereabouts of another badge we need to get the queen of thieves out of the picture and obtain her badges as well yeah she's only gonna cause problems if there's ever war with the stat that is the staff of power of Iraq and I'm is it not it is thanks for noticing so with that is Jaken you only need two other badges to secure access to the castle so if we can find still at large we know that the queen of Thieves definitely has my seal my former CEO the Lord Commander seal the stewards seal as well as the high flame keepers phylactery so we know that she has three which means that she could conceivably already have access to the castle hmm which is why she needs to be removed from the equation indeed in pressing town the other remaining seals are those of the Archmage which we have the castellon the Lord Mayor and the guild master if Jupiter Jones notes the location we just need to find the location of one other and we can make a move on the castle I still think it's important that we deal with the queen of Thieves as well and closely monitor the falling fire because one option is if we dealt with the queen of Thieves we could also recover a badge and if we can get all the badges the castle ins badge Castle in was the former keeper of st. Selena's Abbey it's possible that the falling fire may have that infiltration mission if they control saint salinas it's not like we haven't gotten to st. salinas before no we know how to get there and I do have a few tricks to help us get in this time as for the Lord Mayor and the guild master the guild hall and the old town assembly chambers were where their offices were they've been dangerous locations for some time but now at the null armies the null force is broken up it might be possible to search those places too so obtain badges recruit an army take on the Queen take the castle and they find Drac trying to fetch rock into him how are we going to deal with the queen of Thieves we need to lure her out and it might be possible to do it with the help of Jupiter Jones in retrieving this other badge because if he knows where it is she's also probably knows where it is we also need to possibly find out where she's keeping the bomb that she took from us and get it away from her because if she uses that against us that could be dire so I think those are the two keys now luckily we have some friends who know the sewers really well and I happen to know for a fact while we were rooting around down there that there's a secret entrance to the queen of thieves lair were in a Dewar's we found that entrance when we were trying to find an escape it was a little bit crowded so we escaped through he's gonna walk - yeah we can't shoot well they let us out after we bowed to them and we're almost eaten by a dinosaur yeah sure I think we know another way in though well there's this theory we found that little hole that the sewers could lead us to yeah so I know a certain I know a certain individual who can guide us yeah but then we need the the pipe so you're proposing an assault on the queen of these stronghold directly I'm proposing an infiltration mission to obtain the bomb and then an assault on the queen of Thieves yeah with that bomb in play it's hard to it's hard to read her if we've learned anything from Oscar it's that some of these they don't seem have anything to lose like she would rather see what he said I could hold a crackdown or commander we could order we've had some time to recover we could order our soldiers to attack buckle down Road directly and perhaps that chaos would give you the cover that you need to infiltrate and find out what else destroy whatever the queen of Thieves has and robbed or blind I do want to have yeah I like the idea of having a surface distraction I think we need to coordinate with other connections to see if we can also get an underground mission going as well if we strike at buckle down Road directly the queen of these is going to strike back at us directly as well I know which is why we can only do this one time and it needs to be done properly which is why I think we need more help so I think the order of events here is we need to find the pipe that River talked about we need to find the badge that Jupiter talked about well we have to talk to him about yes yeah and then if we can get Jupiter and his men to help out the hooded lanterns on the surface attack yes we we also need to ask caspia for an army but they might take a while getting here so that might be something that's more reserved for the Battle of defending Drakon her but yeah if we if we can get us going through the sewers while the surface draws out most of the Queen's men into open battle and they're not an organized combat force that's where we have the benefit the queen is crafty but her men you're gonna have no problems so they are brutal so don't underestimate them we can also have a front line of fish folk perhaps so it mean by the underground yeah yes there's there's options yes okay but what we need to also do is send a message to Eric and see what news we can find for resources hmm River says I'm ready to send messages both to caspia and to Eric and wet in which cross if you both let me know what you need to say I can send those right away okay everybody okay with our plans everybody's yes River can you give us a moment and we'll talk to Jupiter and before we send our messages okay so the pipe the badge the clean of fees then the castle and then the war the war that's that's what it looks like our series of events are somewhere in there we need to go talk to the rat prince and to the Duchess of the fish people yes yes okay let's go talk to Jupiter Pluto gotta go see your bestie my friend other than yes this is okay guys remember we're we're friends with Jupiter Jones now but not lamb I'll try to be so down in the mess hall of the chamber of The Berrics Jupiter Jones is clawing his way through through a pair of roast chickens as Len eats a plum and his other end his other cronies are all a very small number of them are around and he stands up and bellows as Pluto Jackson enters the room Pluto Jackson Jupiter Jones it's good to see you and it offers his hand and takes you in a pair ah it's good to see you too I've heard your friends are moving up in the world it seems like you keep more princely company these days I thought that these two were just rat catchers and rabble rousers but they've actually made something for themselves I do the playful like under each arm and I call these all scamp's oh yeah I mean we are that too like don't that doesn't come off our resume yeah I've heard a lot of things and I want to get a few answers to some my own questions have you heard the news of Illyria I have thoughts feelings wealthy Illyrians want to push claim shouldn't Cass be a push back i greed your hair and there's beer around yeah okay beer house Jones and house Jackson are two of the oldest and greatest houses in caspia the house the greatest and the other houses like add to it they're really trying here and we share blood through the former Queen Lenore and battle the blood through battle and if the rumors are true you've been hiding an error in sight I mean in playin Finnair in plain sight oh wait you said err yes Lord Jupiter Jones it is true my nephew George of my sister and William was Leonard bunk as I heard yep bran castle like hold it up on my family tree I carry the why so his his grandmother he is a Jackson because that's Lenore well in that case best come to support of my cousin's claim it is good just it's it's good to see eye-to-eye with you Lord Jupiter Jones we best send word back home to gather forces agreed my men have been decimated over the weeks what happened I was gonna say how many do you have left still have a few dozen remaining we did way better than here way better than me we were in the old city exploring through and well a few things have happened you seen those crazy folks littles worshippers the falling fire mm-hmm well we saw them they had this big cart they were going through the city streets towards champions bridge and I and on that cart they had a massive skull it was a dragon skull and bones this was just the other day I wonder where they got that hmm what just found a dragon found it yeah unattended but in the midst of that I've been fighting we've been battling against some of those gangs we were exploring by the old guild hall seeing what treasure apparently there were some vaults down there when we got there they've been ransacked but I managed to follow up and found there's another set of vaults in the old town assembly chambers where I think one of this sort of signs there used to be this council that ruled over drakon High and one of them there was one of these dead members of the Queen's men there we found his body in the vault and he had information on him that suggested that they knew that there's another vault the possibly location of one of these badges over at the old town assembly chambers so I went there send some of my men to investigate and it doesn't look like the place has been ransacked yet it's ruined but might be there thought I would come tell you as a gesture of goodwill because it seems like this these thieves are after all these things yeah they they're looking for them all over the city we're trying to stop them well all I can say is that it looks like they got whatever one was at the guild hall but you might still have time to get the one at the old assembly chambers I know it's there we have to go quick that might have to take priority mm-hmm you wanted some help I was just gonna say what are you up to well I say me couple men we get storm that place right quick take it right over good nice rolling jack and it just so happens that as a member of the amethyst Academy I'm now allowed to have an apprentice so if phlegm is interested bury the old hatchet I'm willing to put aside our differences to have him work under me [Music] you want me to work under you as an apprentice wing it's insulting well what am I going to learn from you what level spell can you cast swim cast some spells wait come on can you cast the cone of clutter you go to school all this comes naturally to me because I'm just so wonderfully talented with music I don't want to study books I don't know I don't want to start burning smell slice yeah just enough and I'm like okay LEM if you don't want to work as my apprentice then maybe we can work together on the field I say and I like grit my teeth a little as I say the last part I definitely want to be there something bad happens to you that'll be hilarious in any case if you're working under Jupiter Jones clearly he's gonna be pulling all the weight in this partnership you guys are just lucky that he's so agreeable because you're related I don't know four we might not let you at the adult table much longer Jones does he speak for you LEM shut up grown-ups are talking I go I Pat LEM on the shoulder and I press the digitate to soil him I'm so excited this is awful listen if the Lord Commander wills it yet chill out LEM the chill out he storms out haha you'll be over it everyone likes to make fun of it man yeah he's he's I I still think he's a fine spell caster and wall well don't worry in the in the battles I'm excited to see what he's capable of on the field and then show him up you think he's capable of anything in the field ha he stays in the taverns and drinks well myself and the others actually go on the adventures oh thank god well that saves me a headache do you have your big bodyguard - indeed will rally him we should show up in force do you think you can bring any of your men can bring a few Rangers they're less heavy hitting in the front but they've got some good skills with archery sounds good we may have to move quickly I think if if this queen of thieves is going after this badge draw her out who else knows might be fighting over it words getting out that people are starting to find these things and even the silver order has been giving us a hard time - did you not see their letter oh you did I've heard yeah yeah they might be a little bit I think their forces have gone down with their battle that they had with the falling fire but that's not saying that they're not going to come back in full force oh we need to get prepared we may have a month maybe two before they're coming so we need to send these messages we also have to be very wary of any travelers we meet with delirium in their chest because it could be converted civil order it could be indeed the marks of those followers crazy once I had a few of my men even defected them - it's happening to everybody wow this is not good this is why you know there's some people that really believe it it's scary to think that it might be falling stars new age of the world a lot of people like sound - that sounds like a bunch of hoo-ha to me but what do I know ours what if you're my wife have some information no we're just a couple of Caspian boys just out here in this magical world just trying to get along I have this ring those stuff very impressive we we you know let's just go back to basics what we know how to do kill monsters and grave Rob kind of sort of steal stuff from the oh yeah just kill monsters yeah how many monsters have you killed since we seen you last oh well I've killed at least thirty horrible monsters indeed how many bridges of minotaurs have you taken down I was down at Temple bridge and we fought minotaurs there it was very deadly did you kill one Minotaur you maybe even to ignatius kind of shakes in there it's no gay what's uh what's going on with that sword there Pluto was excited to see me draw feast your eyes upon Ignatius I gotta be honest with you I I didn't kill that Minotaur it was one of my men and collectively between me and all my men we've killed maybe 30 small rattling or any of them wearing fancy dress no I don't believe so okay good cuz we're gonna need every rattling that we can get so from now on please don't kill any rattling x' in the city wait what if you come across any rattling they look like they're on attack you tell them that you are working for the three ghosts trust these our numbers up because we have a way to control them have you anxious ignatius whispers to glue the deception of those vile creatures is almost as bad as them themselves you should burn them and destroy them like they're nothing but bottom feeders when ours will disintegrate this city oh you don't want to be here is Main Street it's okay we're gonna kill everything one day no one has learned how to turn meat shield you you would dare to call them a false god hold yourself higher than the flame and claim the mantle of deity don't you dare all right the two ghosts the two ghosts plus the guy with the flame sword which is scary enough doesn't have enough ring to it your friends are mortals but not gods that they even claim to be dark deities we might have to kill them I have a very shocked look on my face and I put the sword away and I just try to I kind of keep silent if they continue to lie cut out their tongues and we've convinced the rattling is that weird you got to keep the voices in my head nobody's gonna silence our ability to lie to these rats oh well we won't need to lie to them if we can get the pipe and then we'll kill everything I mean no no it's fine everything's fine the sword isn't talking to me or anything oh that's good yeah the vial rats will not hold an office acred fire then they should be destroyed I agree I agree just keep it down your bears me in front of the Jupiter Jones or embarrass yourself before the flaming I know I'm just learning I'm still learning the ropes maecius I'm just I know it was a lot of responsibility to take you from the the church there but you were really good these past three days you weren't lying you were fighting you were being brave and heroic I was really impressed with what you're doing but now you're talking about lying to a bunch of rattling so you can get their vile help I thought you were strong and brave what what what what what can I kill right now to make you happy we continue to see I'm standing next to you just like talking about how much I want to lie all the time shaking he's shaking with anger as long as we continue to lie to the rats they will work for us and then we have an army it's that simple I think we need to now send our letters soon as sooner than later okay I'm gonna send mine to Erik telling him about the situation that's happening and asking for his speedy reply mmm in order to with the sending spell you can send 25 words and receive an instant reply of 25 words instantly yeah okay I have a letter to force all okay recovered documents for George's lineage Illyria claims are invalid we require troops for war when diplomacy fails six weeks house Jones is aligned with us Saul replies well done my son you're so good we will muster the soldiers of our house and march forth to Drakon Heim see you in a few weeks well I went well that was actually perfect I mean I guess everything in there is pretty important tossin cassia and the final thing he says secure the crown heiress and George are coming with us [Music] it's a family of hit so we get to meet the future king he better be clean and his mom float oh he better be cool I mean I haven't I guess I haven't seen him in a couple months but yeah he was cool when I left if I'm appointed the like court wizard and then you stepped down from the throne and some jerk kid takes over and I hate him it's gonna be rough are you well we'll figure all that out don't worry if he dies do you stay on the throne I'm just like not mom you want your just theory theory theory total theory maybe interesting anyway no Ignatius because stop thinking those thoughts of betrayal honor your nephews claim I do I do honor my nephews claim you were thinking of killing him weren't you like bear that you read your thoughts it was like the first second it was just like it was a maybe it was like a what if like I was like what if I could fly you can't stop deceiving yourself a self-deception is how it begins it creates impure desires and delusions of grandeur self-deception is indeed one of the greatest sins imagine if you were king guys if we could just stop lying for like 10 minutes just just to get through this I just I don't know I I don't know if I feel comfortable with it what do you like I haven't told a lie I just asked you what would happen if we killed a few no stop I mean sorry I said that wrong if your nephew died is very different than what I said Oh God I've made a I've made an error let's just not think about draggin him is a dangerous place what are you saying that if these truce my nephew is a confident fighter and he is he isn't 12 he's a man of caspia we also trained it we're trained very young 50 and he is going to be in a capable leader when his age is appropriate as all Caspian czar little I'm messing with you that's how you wink and that means Ignatius saw you wink don't you yeah what do you know what you're gonna say yes okay so we continue bickering can you agree look it's just I've become much more righteous ever since the flaming sword from the church tells me everything to do Pluto I I know I'm not actually going to murder your nephew that would be literally horrible like I'm not like you're murdering the new no I just asked what would happen if he died and now we've gone into this weird conversation that's making everybody uncomfortable I'm not a murderer it only gets a little bit weirder because it once the conversation sort of segues Jupiter Jones is like well of course you could marry one of my cousins and then that one of us kind of figure it out yeah he's already married no no Jupiter Jones that George Oh George marry one of it like basically George marry one of his own cousins well at least some of us get to choose who we marry oh yeah yeah not you anymore sorry I make it about me again Erik 25 words right yeah okay it's vayo sonya dragon home in trouble war is impending Academy partnership with crown but need your support sending word to get resources father is alive I know either live I know the reply comes shocked to hear from you glad you're well I will counsel with the nobles and bring reinforcements thank you you ever get here first yellowish thank you yes so in in the days to come more forces will be rallied throughout West amar and caspia to meet the illyrians we will come back to this several times but you've contacted your allies abroad and they will begin mustering their forces to bring to the city if indeed it comes to war when do when diplomacy fails I have a feeling in my heart that we can convince them what is your plan from from here so to summarize it seems like you would all like to go what would you like to do next and what are your what is your endgame okay now it's to you to decide that just what's the fate of the cities going next is Jupiter Jones lead to the badge right over the badge then what about the pipe and get the pipe we have no idea where the pipe is I'd like to maybe put the Academy on some info sourcing and put a few of the Rangers at their disposal to go find info okay with the Academy's intelligence and the hunted lanterns ability to scout to try to get a read on a possible pipe rather than gallivanting all over dragon oh this pipe of the sewers is that what it's called yes yours what about also getting a read on the what was the the hovel that the queen of thieves lives in I'm really trying to put bro what's that call down row maybe just having some scouts there just to see if any more activity starts to happen yeah as we prepare for what is gonna be like another assault on them as well at the same time no I agree with that idea but something we need to keep in mind is any Scouts that we send typical down row when they return there needs to be thorough magical investigation into making sure that they are who saintly who they say they are agreed we cannot risk the queen of thieves poking around in our business that's what we have Ignatius for can I just say that - like what if what if Jupiter Jones men are affected I was just thinking that - pretty much the only people that can really trust right now are some of the major skilled people just because they seem to have the best lockdown protocol I've been the queen of thieves all along oh my god hey thinking she's gonna make me murder you I'm just kidding Ignatius would know something then we use Ignatius before we go and make sure that we're all you know pure and rude going so we we get we get the badge that Jupiter knows about we get the pipe then we rally the rat and the fish folk yep then we make a move on the Queen the queen of Thieves one other thing we didn't handle is that believe you guys also wanted to trade some delirium back to the Academy we can kind of rewind a bit and handle that because did you want to trade in your delirium to them yes okay I worked it out you guys had 19 you had nineteen fragments five large crystals and ten shards each of the fragments are worth a hundred gold pieces the crystals are worth a thousand and the shards are worth five hundred so in total the Academy will pay you a bounty of eleven thousand nine hundred gold pieces for the Delirium be rich and five thousand of those can go towards enhancing my goggles so you want to Commission the gem of seeing yeah yeah okay let's roll to d69 [Music] okay they will be ready in nine days Wow say we we go over the list you know while we're traveling and ask around about some of these magic items and figure out which ones are gonna be best right yeah anyway with the goggles oh yeah you think those are gonna be handy I mean I'm thinking of them is like like yeah they'll be my goggles but they're for us as a team we need the true singing yeah yeah ever had you seen yet okay I'm like see what she is yeah scary gotta look through them when we see her sure oh cool so you're gonna spend five thousand from that so you have basically six thousand nine hundred gold pieces remaining if there is anything else from the potions or magic items that you wish to purchase I'll give you guys till next week to think about that for sure okay okay and I'll also don't and you can requisition your five hundred gold pieces or what the potions each as well okay so make sure that you decide what you want just so we could just load up on potions we could I think there's some good stuff but I think we need tomorrow oh well okay it won't say so you make your decision and then you are going to team up with the hood lanterns and Jupiter Jones and make for the the the mysteries of the of the final badge or one of the badges that's missing as we hang out with Jupiter Jones an offer I say let's give him some sodium's and get some like good feedback yeah yeah would you like to try a delicious this is an incredible energy drink I feel so energized good yes credible do you have a marketing team for this yet yeah we're really yeah just trying to figure our branding or experiment and see if it does anything I take out my moveable rod and I click the button I say can you pull this he tries very hard to pull the immovable rod and he gets a 24 to try to pull it no I needs a 30 yeah he doesn't try so hard okay we're gonna work on guys valuable data for the sodium's I take the rod already is there anything else you guys would like to accomplish or set in motion before you prepare to set out for the Guildhall we're gonna we're gonna get their items worried we've got our spells I also just want to say back to the Academy that as much as they can prepare potions with their limited resources of exposure for the upcoming war I think it would be a wise thing they are going full steam ahead for or for lolz yeah and I I write I write a letter for a river to give back to let them know what we've learned in this as well yeah quick question for Sebastian how many aqua exper ghosts do we have currently they would have given you each two when you left the Academy hello every time you good every time you visit the Academy if you return and leave they will give you at least two but if you want more than that you need to requisition them and I had three prior to that so now we have and is because we have to basically take one when we leave yeah you take one when you leave are you keeping them and then you need one to come back so when we left what I have used we would have used yeah yeah they would have given yeah you would needed a head won't have one to even leave we had some before that though three three yeah so that got us out and they've given us each two more they would have given you enough to get out like essentially to get out and come back yes but the Academy is a little bit stingy and if they know that you have a resource they want you to use it before they give you more yeah so at anytime we can only have three on us yeah yeah okay right yeah precocious it's not that you can you can only have three it's that that as long as you have enough to go and come back they will give you that but if you want more you more than that you have to Houck either requisition it or buy it so we have three right now as we left to kind of use between us the Academy has incredible resources but they also have a lot that they have to accomplish yeah so they've given you as much as they can without like it's kind of like a logistics sort of thing right I was just thinking depending on how long exper go lasts maybe our first play is to find somewhere that's hazy if we're already under the effects we got the effects then we went back to thee they'd only last couple hours and you probably want to purge it as soon as we get out we left yeah yeah the dose that you would have Liat left to leave the Academy probably would have just been enough for this trick trip in these meetings I imagine there was a group retching such an accession once you guys have set up a tent somewhere do we have any effects from it or no no in this case we'll say you're fine okay yeah do you want me to keep track of money yeah okay I'm just keeping track of our rations I always keep track of my owner so how much gold do we have left from the sale of the Delirium 6900 so I'm just combining my own gold with like the group gold as well seven thousand three hundred and nine Wow Wow alrighty so I'll let you all decide what you if you'd like to purchase anything else with the resources that you have based on the list was there and the items available so all those can be requisitioned from the Academy and and remember that you each get that extra 500 gold piece stipend to use on potions instead of that this mission hmm Thank You Academy amazing I'm aging I'm aging yeah alrighty well with that I think that's what we're gonna end for tonight awesome thank you all so much I think I feel like the storm is gathering yeah this was this was probably one of the final columns you were bad a whole bunch of storms are about to hit drum at home storms coming in I'm scared oh boy I mean it's always stormy and wreck and I'm so I'm not too worried about it and the
