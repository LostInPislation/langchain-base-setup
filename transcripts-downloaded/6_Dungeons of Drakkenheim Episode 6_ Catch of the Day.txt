[Music] Drakken i'm is no more struck by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon heuerman caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge good evening and welcome to Drakon hein this is our weekly Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition game with the dungeon dudes that's me Dungeon Master Monty Martin and I'm Kelly mcLaughlin I'm gonna be playing a Sebastian Crowe the half elf shadow sorcerer and we're joined today by our good friends Jill tinnitus playing vo Sonya the tabac C gloom stalker and Joe O'Gorman playing a human battle master named Pluto Jackson thank you so much for joining us once again when last we left our heroes they had set deep underground through the sewers of dragonhide finding unprecedented levels of opposition in the form of a deadly gelatinous cube vo Sebastian and pollute ou opted to retreat from the sewers and head back to the rat's nest to recruit the assistance of the rat Prince the rat folk leader who they had let survive in their very first expedition together in the city the rat prince believing the three heroes to be possessed by the ghosts of some sort of future profit of their profane God as convinced by the group the rat Prince agreed to lead the possessed bodies so called possessed bodies of our heroes through the sewers to a way that might get them deeper in to the city of Drakon Hein for their ultimate goal is to reach the very heart of Drakon hein Market Square where the clock tower resides this was formerly the lair of the avail but the clock tower has been taken over by harpies bird so now that they have ventured partway through the sewers they believe they might be underneath the temple gate just under the city walls itself and after solving a puzzle of the gate control of the sluice gates of the sewers defeating some ghouls and securing this area you are left at a crossroads where will you press on you are currently in this underground complex that you suspect might be underneath temple gate itself however some sort of creature has burrowed in that's how you got into this area through a rough tunnel that the rat prince had discovered so the collapse of this tunnel has caused the staircase that leads up into temple gate to be fully caved in so unless there are some means of moving some heavy stone and rock your options for getting up into temple gate which you've also heard is overrun by nulls are pretty limited that said the way ahead of you was flooded but now that you have reactivated the sluice gates here the sewer line going forward is no longer flooded and you can continue forward if you wish now it looks like I mean we have a pretty sturdy door behind us and we were a bit worried about that other creature that might be potentially back mm-hmm is this a point where we potentially might be a little bit safe from from dangers where we could rest a little bit I mean I even think there's the door that leads to the room where we thought the ghouls and and there's another door that leads to four beds might be a nice place to chill out there's a nice table there that was covered in bones and dead bodies we can have a little picnic and rest for the night yeah I'm just a bit worried so you guys are planning on bedding down in this area well inside the city walls I know that there's supposed to be a lot of haze yes that's correct the haze diffuses the upper levels of Drakon hein and the inner city itself the haze itself veil you know it is a toxic gas and emanation from the delirium itself yeah and it's efuses almost all areas of the city and for you for the longest time the Clocktower was one of the few safe places there it's okay to be exposed to the haze for a little while but long-term exposure usually anywhere in a few hours to a day or so can cause extremely develop debilitating effects and this is represented in game as all of your familiar with by the fact that while you're in an area of the haze taking a long rest does grant you no benefits so yeah if we're planning to venture into the city on a long journey to the center of it even though we're mostly okay right now I think it would just be a good idea to kind of boost ourselves up to as full as we can be before making this Trek not just cuz it's gonna be dangerous the road ahead is going to be dangerous and you want to get some snacks before I want to eat some have some snacks but definitely I think we should be at our best especially if we're potentially gonna be you know when we get to my my tower my hideout I'm gonna be fighting some harpies there pretty nasty so I just want to make sure that if we can get to that point if we're already like low then that probably even getting to the tower is gonna be pretty hard on us so I mean also the fact is there's literally a room with beds and it will take a rest later it's going to be in the middle of a sewer now it is a room also covered in consumed entrails and bones that several ghoul corpses are still I mean it's gonna get a low rating on but will still accept it yeah but when you start coming here how many how long have we been in Drakon high now I feel like a beds of bed at this point like you know I'm used to seeing guts and blood and entrails wherever I go we kick dead bodies just for fun at this point I me mind it's a right it's like a ritual that's right that's right it's like a culture but I feel like I feel like Sebastian's already kind of given up on the fact like when he came here he was like I like my beds and my fancy linens and now he's just like hey look a bed it's covered in blood better than the sewage floor we changed him so much so your plan then is to take a long rest here in this area before pressing forward yes okay as you discuss this the rat prints chimes in and says we keep going yes yes do you sleep I'm nocturnal I sleep at night yes sleep it during the day yes yes it's it's these darn mortal bodies yes thank you ghosts as ghosts do not require sleep it is the it is this fleshy corpse that seems to need sustenance oh yes humans very very weak tasty but very very weak not strong at all and you know how you can help us you know ghosts in these mortal bodies is by finding sustenance for us so that way we don't have to waste our sustenance on our long journey you need eat yes yes what about all the cheese I gave you yes yes yes that's you like all the later all the cheese's I love all the cheese's you eat that yes it's good good good good okay finally some cheese we should you share you share yes I will share you've been such a good guide down here for the ghosts as well yes okay okay yes yes yes I go forward I find us more food yes go don't go too far we need you back you're safe oh yes you're going to make sleeps now I have a question for the great rap prince where would you lead us to next we go forward forward forward through the sewers yes yes yes where you want to go where you want to get end up we want to get as close to the middle of the city as possible Market Square Oh many old foods there yes yeah many tasty things where once there I remember as little rat eat eat eat eat now if we go that way yes yes I lead you Market Square yes yes yes I know the way through the sewers yes is it far not far but things different now you open those gates you're very smart you figure them out yes yes yes we not have to swim now so we go much much faster perfect perfect all right so yes we need we need sustenance good loyal follower of the you know rat gods minions go forth and get me food okay so the with that the rat Prince ventures down the stairs into the sewer proper as it is draining out you can hear the rushing of water still coming from below as the build-up of water and sewage that has been accumulating down here for probably close to 15 years is starting to wash out and as it goes by the smell kind of coming up from that staircase of like this stagnant water does kind of rush through and you could hear it it's pretty overpowering the sound at first but after a little bit of time as you begin to make your accommodations and given the way that the area is laid out you're able to find quiet enough rest here what is your plan for bedding down so if we go into this room with the big metal door that we were in with the ghouls can't at least shut that yeah shut that we can like I don't know hang out have a chat at this table and then go into the other room shut that door um do you think that we should take turns like one of us just sitting at that table keeping watch I think we should definitely have a watch will that mean we all don't get a long rest though if you stagger your watches yeah that's okay okay cool okay yeah I think we do that once first watch second watching third watch I can do first other second I'll do third okay so they will be taking the first watch yeah okay who is taking the second I'll take the second and I'm thinking - we should we should probably barricade the door do you want me to like move earth to put some rubble well we can close the door and we can because it opens out shoot dad open this yeah because it was a it opens out yeah so yes Keep Watch yeah just just can we put some of those applies from the secondary room in front just to block it I know it opens out but at least it don't have to make noise to come over it yeah that's a good idea what if it's the rapid that comes back well then one of us will be awake to know not shooting we should have given him a password before we sent him a hoof I mean this is assuming that he makes it back to that's what I was kind of getting a little bit out of him like so which way would you go like take a left [Music] on this little subtleties of sugar I think about it sending him off may be kind of dangerous not off alone and he's never been in the sewer before without the water well I mean he'll sort of though my thing is if he doesn't come back and we find him later he's toast or if we find him later and he's in trouble okay well that's a different story we're dead but I mean if he just leaves us you will get the wrath of the ghosts no I'm not worried about his alliance yeah I'm pretty sure he's loyal to us where we are as gods or his The Herald's of his gun heralds of the gods okay so I think we okay we have a pretty airtight plan with zero seems all right I suppose let's uh let's see to the watches so you need to use my fun little rules for resting and watches so here's how it's gonna work each of you on your watch are going to roll me a d6 and I'm also going to roll a d6 and based on those results of your die rolls and mine something may or may not you're in a pretty safe area but we'll still see what things might emerge and in general for those of you following along on stream low rolls are bad and high rules are given as Purdy advice as is their custom okay so there you are taking the first watch I am as Sebastian and Pluto bed down and you take your seat what do you do with yourself or your watch I'm not too concerned with like entertaining myself I'm just gonna set up a chair at the end of the hallway facing the door with my crossbow ready almost like an old like a gunslinger because I don't trust I could come down here so okay I'm ready I got a six you got a six okay so a few hours pass is your watch [Music] and through the window through the doorway start to hear a low shuffling and a dragging sound what sounds like something grunting and then you hear a thick pounding on the door do I recognize this grunting give me a perception show [Music] sixteen it sounds like the rat Prince I keep my position this time actually I stand up instead of sitting down and I say who goes there oh oh Cat Cat goose is me is right Prince yes did you bring my food oh you'll come see a very very special yes okay there's anything out there I have I have my crossbow pointed so no exercise it's safe okay I approach the door to open it slightly okay you open the door it opens you can see on the ground at first there is a giant fish it is easily the size of a human head and as the door opens up and you see this fish that has deep gashes that the rat Prince is made into it the fish has arms and legs is the size of a person this is still alive no it's very dead oh good okay has human-like arms and legs see this is what comes out of the river it does not surprise me at all oh wow you it's real kind of flops a little bit with a debt spasm oh the rat Prince kicks it and says oh yes this big dinner yes this is a spike you like fish yes yes yes this is my favorite thing thank you you are pleased the rat god so much oh you can even have the eyeballs if you want oh I've also good I like the bread you yes yes yes yes yeah wait if I can get bread but yes generally if I can accomplish bread within my meals yes all right let's drag this thing in here and close the door so that way nobody hears okay the rat Prince and veil the two of you together drag this gigantic fish man into the room it smells so bad and as I said it has human arms and legs and is wearing a loin cloth it is a fish head so I'm good with it yep it doesn't faze me that the scales are kind of a glimmering blue purpley color yeah what'd you do um first of all um I say repres watch the door so that way oh yes yes something happens just there were many more you want me to get more but no right now I think this is good for now okay yeah but later you let me know where you got this cuz I'm gonna need this later um I actually start to pick up many many they all down in the sewer tunnel ahead they seem very very confused I sneak up on one grab him and bring him back for dinner oh well doesn't have to tell the others about the fact that there are fish men in the sewers we probably need to avoid them since we probably stole one of their friendly I'm very very careful yes very very sneaky like ghosts I learned from you yes yes maybe you'll become a ghost one day oh I hope not that I would have to die yeah but then you'll be eternal ether Oh spirit uh you know that sound rather unpleasant oh it's great okay okay well I start to pick off some of the scales I'm like I can make something cool with this maybe sell it's shiny it could be like delirium you never know as you inspect the scales you can see that there are actually pieces flakes and pieces of delirium embedded on the creature scales no we might be able to use this for a little bit of research and our project that'll be something good to trade how many scales do I can I take off with the rest of your want watch if you want to spend your time skinning and gutting this gigantic fisherman under percent because on the last watch we're gonna get some barbecued fish me some fire right it's very strange the fish parts of the fish man are fishy but the arm parts of the fish man aren't it's not like I haven't seen you know men are yes that's what I'm just the assembling and I'm making sure that their fillets are ready it goes - it'll be your job you yeah remember it yeah so I get all ready and then i I then you know take the scales put them away and wake Bluto up for his watch okay Pluto you wake up in Vail has gutted this gigantic there's four there's two humanoid arms and legs over on the side gigantic fish do you tell them that they were attached no I'm at this point I'm like that was a load and I guys still have fish guts all over my hands and I just Pat your arm I'm like your turn that I go to bed the rad prints go it looks at you goes I do good yes yes yes yes oh yeah this is fin this was you yes fantastic I find him down in the sewers kill him bring him back we eat yes Wow uh and in he did he put up a fight oh yes very much he got me right here and he points to like a scratch on the side he had a spirit a knife yes where are they oh there are many of them further up in the sewer I not go too far before I find them okay well as a reward I can you eat these arms and legs because I reward you with you to me delicacy them quickly it's a he takes them and starts eating them right in front of you raw I its disgusting there's blood as disgusting as it is it just helps me kind of look at the fish in a new light after I just separate it from the humanity and the loin cloth I definitely get rid of the loin I'm gonna throw it in the corner something I don't want it to okay roll your d6 is there anything else you'd like to do during your watch um I'm gonna continue preparing the fish okay to be more fish than man big old six okay I roll the one already and I'm just kind of like sitting on a chair at the table just working on it with like kind of like an eye on the door but also working away at this fish the rat prince has devoured the art of one of the arms and goes into the other room and is now sleeping it's all times you consider continue to work a few hours later you hear what sounds like tumbling rock and crumbling masonry coming from the hall beyond so just outside the door mm-hmm I'm gonna put I'm gonna approach the door and I want to put my my head to the door I want to try to listen closer it's a rhythmic bang you'd hear this Chung Chung Chung and then collapsing Rock and some sort of strange droning noise like a accompanying it in the hall beyond hmm can I tell which way it's coming from you're on the other side of the door so I'm on this yeah yeah it's coming from the cavern [Music] interesting interesting [Music] I'm so [Music] don't want to disturb the rest but I also yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna take my place back at the at the table okay and I'm gonna keep keep an eye on the door [Music] the droning is getting louder and the crashing is getting more frequent and all of a sudden there's a massive burst and it sounds like you heard the sound of tumbling masonry and falling gravel like there was a collapse coming in the caverns I'm gonna I'm gonna prepare my self for combat and I'm gonna go wake up the reference okay no no Kat get away get away anyway wakes up Oh Janey ghost what you need you wake me i sleeping having dream I hope you had a restful sleep oh not really no you interrupted it but he's okay he's okay look I have a very important question for you yes yes I need you to tell me more about the monster of the cavern Oh monster it made crashing noises and as it says that you hear this crash crash crash and banging noises and you hear a bang bang like bang let those oh he's monster oh let's come back to its cave what do we do we wait oh he's terrible the eyes the claws oh and he climbs up in the corner of the room and his shuddering ghost ghost you must save us you have to be quiet and you have to stay here okay and I'm gonna go back into the room and I'm gonna sit down in my chair no actually I'm gonna stand at the corner I'm gonna like sit like off the edge mm-hmm and just be around the corner so when you look into the room you don't see me but I'm just kind of sitting there waiting listening for anything from the door okay you hear these crashing noises crash crash more tumbling nice right sounds like the rock is being moved and shaped around and you continue to hear this low droning noise [Music] it's almost as like the horn of a ship and it's in its resonance and it's echoing down the hallway quite loudly [Music] I'm really don't want to do the thunderous crash it's a bastion of a Oh it'll wait I was gonna say are we carrying these noises online oh yeah so I'm just calmly sitting in the room sandwiches oh my gosh uh what can I come out and I'm just like noises Gus I assumed it was just you know you know when like how does this get cold in the winter like this could be normal here I come out and I see the fish and the severed limbs I'm just like oh we were prepping dinner yeah this is those human arms like no they're just you tainted arms and legs is that dinner yes dibs on the leg it's a fish leg I don't know like there's like frog legs Fishlegs questions anyways focus do yours it's hard for me yeah there's some crashing happening inside I've been just trying to ignore I didn't want to worry you we'd be quieter I mean quieter than that I think we're good crawl crawl I thought about looking at it but I didn't want to alarm you guys he looks so tired thank you I haven't fully gotten by resting I say that we waited out like it might not come in here why would it come in here I mean it never came in here before um does it sound animalistic or machine-like [Music] whatever it sounds like it's very alien [Music] this concerns me does not sound like a natural whaling noise I I go up so you're kind of hidden around the corner here yeah I'm just kind of like leaning against the wall I come and I lean against the wall opposite and kind of look at you and I'm like who's gonna chill here for a bit I mean fail it's pretty dark in here so technically I don't think it would be able to see you what I was thinking is I can I can take my rest now but with you to awake we could also go check out the monster however I'm okay with I mean letting it icons be back yeah it to be honest like if it's going if it's gonna come in its gonna come in we get at least like I know it we're not probably not gonna rest with all this no if that's the only problem is like if we're not gonna rest might as it'll go but I think we oh yeah if you need your rest here one second and I go and I break off two of the fingers from the fish hands and I'm like use these as earplugs as you go to pass those to him there's another crash and a chunk of masonry he hits the door smashing it to pieces well that big oh my god across the way you can see something throwing bits of rock and as the masonry drops across and shatters the opening you can see that you can hear that whatever this creature is is trying to dig up the stairs hmm sneak attack I don't know why we want to get involved with this I it doesn't know we're here I mean what's what's in temple gate it's just a bunch of Knolls right yeah it would be filled with North so I'm gonna do one of the SEAL team things to vae out like I use mold earth to make words appear in front of you on the on the ground that say what are you saying I'm just like why would I particularly make it see us know we're here okay I gotta go to bed and I start thinking afterwards the door it's the room okay make it so check I'm not really fourteen okay the door closes with a slammed can I time it to one of the slams it is not it is not oh and all of a sudden the slams stopped and you can hear these heavy footsteps trundling across the masonry towards the broken door I'm gonna open the door mother guys that was why were you so loud can you make a door out of stone and just and as it comes down the hallway you can see this strange beast it is covered in [ __ ] misplace of awful essence purple blue and green and gray its are its has these elongated forearms that look like they might be rounded like big almost bicep like forearms that end in massive plated claws its hunched over and the shell comes up over its shoulders almost like it's got a hunchback and it has sectioned insectoid like heavy lower legs that lumber like those of our rhinoceros and its face is mandible and has sectioned eyes that gleam and as it comes around the corner you see these flashing lights coming from its eyes flashing and Oppel essent colors of octarine and the Delirium glow roll for initiative a question is it dark in this room it is dark in this room but the creatures eyes are flashing with light what did you do you guys need to be way quieter when things are out like it's a little clunk clunk clunk I'm sorry I really tried to ignore it I really did seeing as I just not very high on initiative I'm like still like I don't even know what's going on right now and what did you get so that you get sleeping I've got six you're still rubbing you got a six male 20 2015 55 okay to be confused we will do one hour tie off roll I need tire go - okay I got a six so I win yeah so we'll have Sebastian Pluto the tunneler there goes first on the tunnel air that's nice okay the mutant engineer is this beast the beast it's like a giant cockroach that's what I envisioned oh he's out there okay yep he's right there so as it comes for it comes forward down the hall and maybe I'll just kick up the camera a little bit hope that lets everyone see what's going on the terrible beast with its Apple essent eyes glow down the hallway they'll you're the first one to act however you are within range of its confusing glare and I need you to make a charisma saving throw you see these this Oppel essent flashing light from the creatures eyes and it is mesmerizing and confusing I need you to enroll a you cannot take reactions I need you to roll a d8 1/8 okay so you scream and cats group and begin swiping in the air as if at almost attacking towards Sebastian with your with your claws yes try to make a melee attack melee attack against a random creature but nothing is within your reach so that is your action but you can still move I'm going to start to back towards the farthest corner that I can go because I'm just freaked out by this thing I'm just like like leave my okay unarmed strike does no damage so even if I did hit you I see you do this and I'm just like what what is happening you know like when you drop like a cucumber in front of a cat have you seen visible cucumber yeah okay the tunneler the tunneler rushes forward down the hallway towards sebastian does it know I'm there it does not until it gets to the very end of the hallway so it's easier around the corner I'm gonna give you cover which will be plus two to your AC against this attacks so it swings around with its two claws getting a 14 and a 26 I'm gonna use shield to block the 14 okay the first attack bites into your flesh with as rips in around the corner at you you take 9 points of damage and then it tries to pull you close and it's mandibles begin to close and crunch and crunch but it only gets a 10 to hit my shield it's just like yeah so like your shield the energy is pulsing out as its mandibles are trying to crunch down around your skull I turn back to the closed door of the bedroom and I say Pluto we need some help ok Pluto it's the start of your turn you can see this flashing from under the door as you closed it and what you won't need to make a saving throw against it because you're starting your turn there what would you like to do it's frustrating when you're trying to sleep and your friends just think like they can have like a rave room and you're like we're roommates and I think there's sort of open the door the chitin monster and I scream it oh you see this hideous creature caspian battle cry which is I'll help you Sebastian and I run at the fast see the reference has closed the other door to the supply room he does it quietly okay so I used about 25 things in movement I'm just gonna start I'm gonna wail on it and give it a big old wha-bam for 15 you you bring your store down and land a solid blow on its back and the shitness huh they hide of the creature its shell like hide is like plate mail so like or not a head of trade you know and then I'm gonna use my bonus action and try to shove it I'm gonna give it a big old shoe verse 17 wait no whoa whoa because it's played man I'm all okay can I use precision attack on a show sure 19 so you bring your sword down and throw the entire weight of your body up against this hulking creature and you shove it down do you want to push it back or knock it prone I'm gonna knock it back okay into the tunnel more and then I'm gonna step my last five feet of movement just getting my closer yeah so I'm just gonna I'm gonna keep it away from from Sebastian Sebastian nice turn Sebastian it is your turn I immediately run around the corner standing behind Pluto yep and I am going to cast Webb on it interesting play nice nice nice thing so put down the template for the web's so a mass of sticky thick strands fill the hallway right in front of pollute oh it seems like a familiar set of events it works so it will need to make the saving throw at the start of its turn I believe yeah each creature that starts is turning the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a dexterity saving throw okay and then the creature is restrained like that sounds good anything else Sebastian a backup I just kind of pushed myself past the table and I'm like thanks Pluto you catch a glimpse of it's crazy glare okay we go to the top of the round Vail you've run into the corner but the creature is still within your line of sight if you want to you can avert your eyes entirely and not have to make another saving throw against it however doing so will mean that you can't see the out rock I'm gonna go for a saving throw I'm like yeah so there - being pretty brave I guess I could shake off the scaredy-cat and go for it okay make a christmas saving throw size 11 super affected by its glare again so roll me a d8 7 so once again you're flipping out cucumber style and you're trying to I'm you slash and slack you can still move but you have no action I'm gonna try to swoop into the room and get as far away bit as possible and still freaked out by it okay and I'm actually gonna round the corners the way I'm not looking at it sounds good this time they oh we now go to the umber Hulk it fails it's saving throw against the webs yeah and is restrained by them however Pluto is still within its grass high so it is going to it is very confusing lumbers against the web's as it tries to claw forward it's gonna go for making its attacks with disadvantage and won't try to break out of the way because this got a meal right in front of it so it comes forward with its first clock getting an 18 19 jackin highs as the resounding blow still sent shudders up your body this is a claw that can break through solid right and when he hits me I'm gonna repo okay because I'm tired of this crit oh so he comes at me with his slow lumbering arm and I just I counter with this blade right up so you stabbed rate is the arm that goes down the soft shell of the underside of the arm you stab into it and a big old 15 the image weights up on the board but do I add my plus six both times or just the ones just the ones yes or fifteen okay we're on the board nice it's gonna continue attacking though it makes another swipe as it recovers this black purpley blood oozes from the wound it brings its other claw down and he gonna let it you batter it out of the way with the shield it tries one last time to lunge forward with its mandibles getting a 19 yeah no more reactions my friend no nice tables come down and you raise your shield and it crunches around and the two mandibles come around the shield and slash into the side of your head and you're gonna take the helmets fourteen points of damage that's a spicy mandible and as it looks over your shield it's crazy no all the sections kind of flashing rate in your face are you going to avert your gaze or are you gonna roll the saving throw I'm gonna look down at my beautiful armor avert my gaze you've hurt your gaze okay so you cannot see the umber Hulk hmm if you choose to avert your gates I choose not to see the umber Hulk okay you look away from it closing your eyes shutting your visor what are you gonna do it is so as long if you're looking away from the umber Hulk you can try to attack it but you'll do so with this advantage because you effectively cannot see it is its restrained it is restrained so that will cancel it out yeah I will swing wildly at where I think it is okay which Duncan hope is right in front of me holding onto my shield getting a 19 that will hit yes for 12 damage those always better than your crit I'm going to so you feel the shock of your blade latch on cut through something that you kind of hold your shield Oh like right in front of your face closing your eyes just battering downward with the sword and I'm gonna use my bonus action to just second wind okay the stand my ground just stand your ground Sebastian the creatures mandibles are crunching in around Pluto shield its opposite eyes glowing everywhere in the room are you going to avert your eyes or are you going to look at this look at it Sebastian stares him in the eyes make a charisma saving throw so hope it's worth it 20 you love it it's beautiful but not hypnotic so I run up back next to Pluto mm-hmm and I look at him and I'm like I hope this thing is flammable because that Webb sure is and then I'm gonna burning hands into the webbing and the other okay it makes a dexterity saving carelessness advantage getting it yes burn that is 11 damage and it's going to take to D for as long as it stays in that weather yeah because it's covered in four sections of webbing which are all ignited I'm gonna say that it's gonna take more damage because it's in multiple squares 2t for fire damage for every 5 foot cube away yeah so for each cube then because it's completely engulfed in it so it's getting cooked looks like we're getting 2 miles tonight but because it's gonna get cooked it's no longer restrained by the web's I'm gonna say that effectively the web's are gonna be burned away by the starter that's nice turn that's fair okay bail we're over to you okay take the breaths in that room getting away from those eyes all right take him take a couple seconds and I turn back around to the door of the room and I'm like all right time to skewer this cooking roach and I fire my actually first before I do that I'm like wait Zephir strike of my bonus action so that way I can take an edge on this I'm so I use is that per strike it's one of my spells here comes the killing with my long bow with my sharpshooter did you get take advantage for their first Rick there it is so 15 the Miss does not penetrate its thick armored hide and I'm like well no skewers tonight and I twist back around the corner okay nice shot nice shot the

four another 808 teen right now and 220 nice it is burning as it rushes its way through the crumbling webs remove the web template it is bloody I guess burned yeah and it comes forward with a rage and smashes both of you know getting a 23 against Sebastian and a 22 against pollute Oh both of you take nine points of damage as it smashes its fits piss down and then it turns its mandibles and lunges forward at Pluto with them trying to bring them down over issue Oh getting a natural one and I'm going to Sentinel it okay for attacking my my Herald The Herald of Pluto Jackson that's me so in this desperate moment as this burning umber Hulk lumbers down the hallway smashing and grabbing at the two of you try to strike at it but it's deflected off of its thick hide I'm just swinging at it as it's like crushing me with its flaming I got you by the helmet and here just what will you do pollute oh you want to avert your gaze yes okay you won't look at it at the madman lightly I won't look at the flame okay you're attacking with this event what you got hit I got a precision strike and I'm gonna get a 23 whoa so gritting your teeth trusting your hearing you swipe towards where the our Hulk

I get angry and I I move up and I'm like stop trying to eat my friend and I'm gonna cast burning hands actually no I'm gonna I'm gonna just scorching ray at three times do you still want to move up

barbecue tonight and to go back around the corner I do not want to look this big in the face I'm so freaked okay oh I should mention that little Jackson is very bloodied I see that super bloody pollute oh you're the only having taken so much from it and it's you're blocking its path the sebastian who's just had hit it it smashes you in the side towards the wall getting an 18-2 hit nope smashes again getting a natural one it finally comes in with his mandibles to bite down this is the one getting a 25 there it is for 11 points of damage I have nine help I've it picks me up by the head and flings you to the side and you land on the ground Sebastian now he's like oh oh god no and it rushes forward rate at Sebastian yeah I had trouble with that last Sentinel attacked unconscious Pluto it is your turn I needed that saving throw buddy 12 that is one success Sebastian it is your turn I thought the hawk is right in front of you I'm are you gonna hurt your eyes or terror look at it I still am not breaking eye contact okay roll it that you got 12 okay that's a failure roll a d8 yes I finally have stared at it long enough but it's upset me I've got a three you broke eye contact to look at my body right yeah I broke the eye contact to look at you you're dying god this is so beautiful and you do nothing on your turn Oh stare at its face I am mesmerized by you good sir mesmerized when you poke around your head this time it's like you're like dead against the wall right you know what I am going to use my feline agility to move double my speed I'm gonna run over to Pluto and use a healer's kit to stabilize a creature that has zero hit points okay that will be your action yep and then I'm going to after I stabilize you you could do that or do you want a feed in one of his potions he'll be stable but he won't be back up okay yeah actually I'll feed you one of the potions so that we can get some gracias and then I'm going to after believing it 10 hit points I'm like you okay buddy you're good Oh what happened man okay hit him some more and I've run back in the room okay I did not want to look at this thing I'm so freaked out you're welcome thank you it is the amber Hall external don't worry I did the same for you Sebastian yeah if you need it I like railway ticket goes to smash Sebastian getting a ten I dodged and at eleven I dodged and it comes in with the mandible the mandibles getting it eleven I like [ __ ] I snap back into it as like I'm mesmerized and as it starts swinging at me I do like like I do like a matrix I don't even know what I'm doing I'm like oh God and I start like going backwards and stuff and it somehow just misses me and it's unreal it looks skillful I picture in your head it's playing like Ford and it'd be nice if we're together and you're just like dodging Pluto you're conscious you're beside Sebastian you could take a swipe with your sentinel a disadvantage disadvantage I swipe I go for the for the I pierced his arm I'm going for the legs getting a big old 18 actually it's a zit you get up from the ground I swipe out its at its exposed leg getting 13 damage you slice its leg on yes and it bleeds out horribly screaming and shrieking until it expires it's it's like it's is it like crab meat inside is it like a like violently if not insides are violently ejected out the leg is it meaty no say can we cook it tonight looks like bile bug it's all over protein you know I'm laying in it gasping for breath first first I turned to Pluto who's on the ground barely with it I'm like are you you okay bud can I go to bed synonymous ly with the rat Prince like the cat the rattling is it dead yet did you guys see my sweet dodge no nobody saw nobody Pluto saw the very end of it but he was more busy trying to get his head in Oh grasp me my sword and swinging it out as I could well I'm gonna stand up and I'm just gonna just saunter back to the room I'm not even leaving the room and all I hear is Sebastian can you put that fish so we can have something to eat okay I like I actually I don't even have to smell slots for that I'm gonna use a fire bolt and I I cook the fish and drag it into the bedroom and we eat and go to bed okay the Rapids is turn to watch reference watch we need well we need to nap we need a little little nap the rest of the evening passes without incident long rest yes yeah but I am interested to see it be nice after we wake up the scales because you know if we're talking about delirium scales might be better than these little fish ones yeah I like the idea of harvesting the the monsters that were killing to see if there's any because I'm sure Oscar would have some kind of interest in how the mutations are happening as well and maybe there's certain monsters that maybe have more resilient like I mean he's always obviously interested in you mm-hmm in your blood maybe there's other monsters that hold up really well to it or other creatures we can study the mutations that would be my thing how its different effects are and maybe we can like a mint I'm even wondering if he can use the scale so like grind them into a powder and potentially get some magical energy from that too yeah no I'm a scientist or anything but yes so Sebastian takes the last watch of the night oh yeah which passes without incident but we can have you roll 1d6 [Music] for I get a one but my bad thing that happens when I roll a one already happened so it comes back a lot yeah you can't come back eyes start glowing a little bit you get freaked out great well done you pack your things in the morning assembling the rest of the equipment that you've assembled and what you do well that was a nice relaxing night you guys want some leftover fish person yes actually I think the most fishy parts of it and stay from the people birds it's kind of like a filet of sole fish what I do want to do is I want to check out where it was excavating [Music] excellent yes looking back down the hallway it looks like the creature was trying to dig back up the staircase that it had prior previously collapsed it had gotten a fair way through but hadn't quite finished burrowing through the rock whatever this creature was it was capable of burrowing through solid rock and masonry oh can we take some of its claws too sure yes you're gonna wear them as gloves dig and gloves turn them into clothes since my closet if you look down at its eyes no longer glowing but just cold and dead you can kind of see the little bit of last Sheen like this little flash once and it was calling sorry was called an umber Hulk see rat prints seals you fear nothing with the ghosts are truly mighty they destroy the evil tunneler oh you want to lead us further and now oh yes can I have some of that fish you can have the legs and arms ha ha and and as as much of the of the creepy eyed thing as you want it looks and it grabs its eyes and looks back at you it says rat print save these for later have a good time yes yes good time you have a good time dream self the rat Prince says I go ahead well looking for a fish man find him bring him back so I not see the way ahead but now we not have to swim before it all flooded filled with water yes is yes me not care me to swim get further into City yes now we just walk nice dry yes that is much better for me I'm not a fan of swimming in the sewer water ghosts are very smart thank you let's go we go onward you head down the stairs which are still wet and muck covered from the water that once filled this area it's a small maintenance access tunnel you can see on the gate as you go back down says city workers only kind of engraved on the rock beside it opens back up into a wide sewer tunnel much wider than the previous ones that you've been through and you can see rate at the base of the stairs as you come out the sluice gate that was lowered before has opened so that it's a three section gate so the bottom parts have slid open and then a top great has slid up looking on the other side of the chains and and all the gear work on this side these sluice gates were built to withstand siege weapons and how well protected they are because effectively this is the underground if you're trying to attack dragon hein the sewers are a pretty good way to get in through the walls but of course tracking item had been besieged in hundreds of years people are people have rivalries that caspia Oh sir bring me the sewer tunnel going forward snakes slightly forward so for long stretches it's quite straight and there are several smaller tunnels that intersect with it almost in a grid like powder in here and they're smaller and all throughout you can see overhead there are smaller drains so here and there you will actually look up and you'll see this little pipe with a grate over top of it the pipe itself is just a drain maybe no more than a foot wide and it leads up and you can see little shafts of light in the city of Bob it's not like a Sun sunlight because of course it's completely overcast and it seems like it might be raining because there's a few bits of water that are dripping through these pipes but with the area open it's not flooded the gutter down the middle still has a pretty steady flow of water coming down it bill you follow along the sewer tunnel as it snakes underneath what you imagine might be temple road before it comes to another large intersection and here this is what you see your boat traveled probably about five hundred to a thousand feet at this point it's a good a good couple minute hike down the way did you come to a large intersection it's a t-shaped intersection here there are two more actually sorry three more of these sluice gates that have been set up the ones straight ahead of you is open the ones to the either side are closed well that makes our choice easy I guess do they have the same like engravings and symbols on them yes they do the ones that seemingly may have disintegrated a body on the first gate there's that body wagon they don't have that symbol they still have the engravings of the drought of Drakon Heim on the the the crest of the city which is a dragon perching on a castle but the arcane runes that first gate head are not on these ones are they holding back water yes they are and looking down the seam of the gates you can see that there's a collection of trash and other things that are caught where it's closed perhaps these gates might have been open last night yeah I'm thinking we could reverse what we did and maybe we could potentially open a different way do we wanna what maybe we don't right Prince which way do you usually swim oh I swim past these then there's another like these much further ahead and we go left that way like through the open gate here yes we go the way here we keep going okay straight yes yes I don't see why we would deviate from the references I mean last time we deviated we found ghouls and then we deviated from his plan again and were attacked by a monster no yeah you know I know I think I I think I know what might happen though if we get to the next intersection it might be blocked and then you'll have to do you know what I mean so I I think we have two options we can go look ahead see what it is mm-hmm we could also backtrack fiddle with the machines I'm worried about closing off the whole thing again mm-hmm being back to square one but also I see what you're saying so maybe we just go ahead we Scout and see cuz we can always come back right and then if we need to then we can figure it out but I don't know how we'd have to know a different pattern in order to open close it right Lois thinking real hard right now because his head's on fire with the amount of math he's trying to do there are several dead fish and frogs all along the way there's a few frogs that like living frogs as well flopping fish small smaller ones that are running down the gutter in the middle there's bits of trash weeds algae all these things flowing down the sewer tunnel smells really bad the water has washed out has brought with it a bunt though it's washed through the sewer whatever was collecting here for probably 15 years is now all just making a mess of mud and refuse on the bottom now the water has been drained out how high was the water level you can actually plainly see like when you look up the walls you can see that there's a very clear line of algae yeah on the walls so the water level would have been about 10 feet high only giving when it was filled there would all even maybe a foot 2 feet above before you hit ceiling so it would have been a pretty tight swim what a wonderful smell you've discovered I meant the reference for one for bringing us here reference where were these fish people oh I ran into them here you see that's his blood oh wow you can see that there is a rough stone knife and a makeshift spear broken on the ground here they could use tools airball I feel a little worse for tracking times changed you they oh yeah what's this pyramid attractors my it'd be a spear like a wooden it looks like a the tip of a broken blade has been tied to a broomstick you know crafty good for you DIY get out there human hands I would expect nothing else all right I say we go forward the fish people couldn't have gone down either of these other paths so they must be keep there must be a head oh they're probably really pissed that they don't have water anymore rat rat prints one last question about these fish people did they seem hostile or did you just oh the one that I brought he was very very upset when I got him he was screaming and swearing it was very very funny he said no no you awful rat don't kill me I'll kill you huh if we run into them I say we play it cool and act like we didn't eat one of them yeah rat Prince don't say anything but there's no tasty well maybe we might need to eat you like to have a taste but the surprise is more important because then it's easier to kill them if we heed to write we killed them all we eaten well for dates we bring them back nests yes yes rad prints I have very specific orders you let us do the talking and if we say attack then you attack until then you remain silent did any of the others see you while you drag this other one off no no I am silence teehee like ghost good good so if they saw you again they wouldn't say oh hey there's the rat prints that killed our friend and dragged him off to be eaten he looks at you like he'd never considered that possibility interesting this is great goes yeah well just keep marching on is it very very dark right it's it's like aside from the roughly every 50 feet there is a small drain directly overhead that is open to the street above the sewer is about 20 feet under the street so there's it's a narrow shaft that leads up it's about a foot wide about ten feet tall that leads up to the street above is a drain and there are other smaller sewer pipes that come in and drain down in to the sewer itself but beyond that there are no sources of light because I think I'll hang back a bit and use the drift globe if you guys want to climb stay ahead and all within reason but I don't want to be too far behind but I don't want to be needy yeah I don't want to be too bright okay and I'll set it to like a nice dark blue alrighty mmm-hmm you continue to head forward down the sewers it's quite a walk it's dank smells bad but at least you don't have to swim in sewage it's only a short while before you come to the next major intersection of the sewer and we will follow along with what happens after our break attic yeah down into the sewers before we delve back into the ruins I'd like to give a big thank you to accent shield for providing us with the awesome gaming accessories we use and to tabletop audio for the great ambient music you're gearing and finally 100-years bore for the amazing narration in our introduction video Shmi pol if you're enjoying the stream and want to help support our work check out our patreon you can find it by following the links below or at patreon.com slash dungeon underscore dudes the other really cool thing that's happening right now is the Dungeons & Dragons official team at Wizards of the coast has teamed up with Adobe and they have an awesome challenge for creative fans to create the next official monster for Dungeons & Dragons called the terror of the outer Mountain so if you love cool monsters like the umber Hulk this is your chance to like have your brain baby become one of those weird creatures in the world of D&D so and the prize is actually $5,000 us a chance to meet the dev team and the monster you make will get rendered as a miniature as well that's you can find info about the contest at summon the terror calm and you basically get to download a free Photoshop demo and all these art assets that the Wizards of the coast team is prepared and photoshopped together your frankenstein creation of a monster which is super cool and actually a really handy DM tool i've been poking around with it to try to like make my own monsters and see what i can do with that so we'd be really curious to see what people make with it it's definitely a worthwhile contest to enter it on yeah there's some really cool stuff on there I've been kind of dabbling in it and I'm so excited you're creating my monster yeah awesome so before we took our break the group had bedded down in the ruins of the sewer and got attacked by a horrible monster the tunneler the umber Hulk which exit lives in the sewers under Drakon Heim fighting the creature off and slang it they decided to continue through the sewers under temple road deeper into track and I'm finding that the passage of the sewers were now the originally these passages had been flooded according to the rat prints but they Oh Sebastian and pollute Oh had managed to solve how to work the sluice gates enough at least to open them up and cause the water to flow out so they didn't have to swim forward you're now coming to another intersection deeper into the city it's difficult to say how far into Drakon Heim you are because veil your sense of direction is really good in the city above but down here in the sewers it's really hard to tell how far you progressed you've been traveling for no more than an hour or so and you have come to a major intersection in the sewers you can see here that there is there are two large sluice gates to roughly the north and some probably slightly off that axis it's again it's hard to tell because the sewer passageway has been sneaking slightly here and there and then there is a stepped platform where you can see rushing water falling down as the sewer steps up a level you surmise a veil that this is probably you're probably somewhere along where the hill of dragon high starts to rise up because there's a large cliff where the castles built and so the city kind of all angles upwards towards the north which at your best guess would put you probably on the southern edge of Market Square if this is what's happening here that if the sewer level needs to raise up at this point hmm the water is flowing down towards you from the forward direction from this raised platform and the sluice gates are marked on either side with large carvings again the insignia of Drakon high as well on the on the gates you can see that here originally there was another large sluice gate these three section gates that closed from the left and right and then with a great down on the top so one has opened up and two on the sides have closed our clothes and as you get forward down this way the rat prince goes oh no no no no what is it he points towards one of the closed gates and says it's closed which which one he the one leading to the north he says I was going to take you this way we were going to swim this door was not open before now the ways are closed what do we do now have you ever been down this way before now that it's open [Music] no I have not it's it always was called closed way I always just used to swim come out near the market that way hmm how close to the market are really how far oh very close very very close that way leads to north end of market so we're we're towards the south end of the market oh yeah I don't know well maybe it lead there maybe not I mean if we're at kind of a if we don't know the direction from here maybe it's better to hop out of the sewer yeah but let's see if we can get as close as possible that would be best like go on the south side with the coal a little bit more north it would be better but you know take a look yes is there a is there an exit [Music] looking around you can see that on the far side the the periphery of your light looking up on the platforms there's a pair of ladders on either side of this waterfall of water that lead up to the upper level you can see that there's two bridges that are set across the smooth ways as well the SLUSA the sluice in the middle is filled with water - probably a depth of about 2 or 3 feet it's not that you could stand up in it but it is there is flowing water going down to the center now looking beyond the sewer does seem to continue back and and forward if it opens up or if there's an exit here you'd have to go a bit further to check even above us there's no there's just like the regular foot if you were capable of squeezing yourself up and over yes you could like if you could turn into a vapor or squeeze about into it into a cylinder but beyond that there's no obvious exits from here see we go down a bit further and see what's beyond just don't easily run into any corners last time I did that I ended up inside a cube a gelatinous one how will we go we'll go slow this time maybe we can send the RAM prints kind of on a rat prints maybe you can look ahead I know this is foreign territory for you but scout please do your ghosts well and and find a new way to the surface he climbs up the ladder by the waterfall and he begins slinking up that way and that he stops and you can see starts again and then it comes back down the stair the the ladder back towards you and he rushes back as quietly as he can almost on all fours as he runs forward like a like a real rat he says Oh angry fishes angry fishes that way how many he looks at his hands and all is trying to figure out I'll do it I'll do with my hands and I I don't ask him when at least that many yes yes yes they look very angry I think they're not happy that I ate their friend did they see you I don't know I mean there's no reason for them to be angry at us maybe they know some directions Jackson huddle we could go back we could mess with that yeah and try to read you what we did because potentially now that we've opened the flood even if we do reverse it it might still leave it open like the way not have water come rushing back in yeah like I think the water will rush in from the other ways but I think we we've already started the emptying process as as weird as this sounds I I'm interested in talking to these fish people they don't know about our dinner [Laughter] they seem intelligent enough to build tools they might know another way forward if I talk to something that I've eaten today I'm gonna have a sort of panic attack if I have to be like hi how are you it might slip out it might just come out I don't know I just hold his hand oh my it looks good no no I'm okay with that I mean my experience with morphed magical creatures and Dragon Jaime's is not that they're necessarily friendly but um if you want to haven't met anybody unfriendly yet in the sewers gelatinous cube it was friendly enough I think it was just trying to shake your hand I didn't speak it's like acid uh-huh burn it up monsters are just friends we haven't made yet exactly they're friends who want to eat your face the fact is by this by the description of the horrible death of one of their kind by at the hands of the rat Prince it seems like they weren't immediately hostile towards him he just happened to snatch one of them murderer and drag it back these could be intelligent creatures living in the sewers that build tools and know their way around the sewer is better than anybody all right Sebastian I like but if you get me killed in this sewer do you want me to go ahead and try to try to negotiate this don't want to be like rat food no these are fish rats it's a little different you'll be fish food yeah no no that you will be fish food probably first before me I always have an escape plan an escape plan is to jump in the sewage and float on back I I'll follow my Herald and my guide but I I ready up we're gonna go talk don't look don't look too intimidating if I'm gonna have ready for a little bit I hope they speak one of the three languages I know what languages do you know I know common elvish and under common me too oh okay alright you head forward and as you walk forward down the sewer towards the waterfall and the sluice gate point the collection of fish people have assembled at the top is that we it's more person than you put their legs together it could be like a tail so you walk forward and as you walk forward the the fish people see you there's a collection almost a dozen of them and they all have scales in varying shades of purple blue and green and all of them have eyes that are glowing with a small kind of purply twinge in the center and then these big bulging yellow there there pupils are purple but their eyes are bulging in yellow and filled with blood veins they're wearing makeshift clothing made of sack cloths and loin cloths and a couple of them have rope belts a few of them are carrying makeshift shields or found shields and Spears and swords some of them are wearing crude looking necklaces or carrying trinkets along their their belts and a few of them are carrying one of them is carrying a large pincer-like staff and another is carrying a whip as you come forward the group of them see you and they the first ones amongst them lower their weapons and they say in a blustery voice do I'm gonna push I step forward and I go boom don't think it'd work joy I said and as you say boom they all look very insulted I say well met in common very full and a few of them turn turned to each other in another and one of them said that comes forward and says wow but well Matt in under common I continued to speak and under common are you locals to these parts brah we we live in these parts yes yes this is our home this is the domain of the Duchess excellent we we are merely seeking passage into the city and this seemed a safe route great need we patrol this way regularly we are looking for our our missing friend blip blue [Music] can you describe blip blue yes he was young well muscled he's wearing just just a few cloths carry a spear and a and a dagger he is the Duchess's favorite yes and I chime in you know what we I don't understand any of what's happening I say if you help us find blue we will reward you Robert well up the under Hulk but we ran into a vicious monster back there and in the same room that we encountered the monster we found a dismembered body that looks very similar to your kind is there a chance that that was him make a deception charity you could call help on his own [Music] 22 you see the faces of the roof look blue he shouldn't have gone often on his own he was caught by a horrible monster and one of the others turns and says yes I told you I told you I saw it looked like it looked like catching arms came up from the darkness grabbed him grabbed him they did they did yes a massive monster they did and we slayed that monster oh it did yes do do you have blip Luke's body uh we well I what I do those oh no it was it was quite terrible but I did grab some scales to prove it to you and I take some scales out of my bag I say is this is this your friend they hit up here most all the scales miss Oh Oh No so sorry Oh if we if we had tear glands we would cry I'm so sorry about your friend it's a dog eat fish world out there was it a dog it was it's a buggy I don't know guys I'm trying oh my undercommons old hill rusty so guys are they friendly yeah just don't mention now they were eaten by the umber Hulk they were horrible incident horrible you know you remember just just nod yes looks looks sad look sad yep mournful oh there he goes we're so sorry for the loss of your friend and the seemingly eating of him by such horrible monsters horrible it's truly awful truly truly awful we're so used to our people being eaten by dogs by cats by rats no offense of course none taken I do eat a lot of things in the city do you eat fish not anything but fish I know they have feelings so rather suspiciously and the rat Prince just looks he's like does the rap words understand them you suppress like a fish burp lick my lips a little bit though no no no fish feels they feel I would never ask them ask them how to get out of here oh um we seek passage to the north side of Market Square what above ground you seek passage to the surface look a little north of here preferably do you do you happen to know away this gate is closed once again that monster much removed all the water from your home brewed this skate is open and yes we came to inspect why all our water is gone it's draining away the Duchess will be very very unhappy but if you seek to go to the surface great land above we could show you the way you found out what happened who our good friend your true heroes truly there my name is sebastian crowe and i avenged your friend yes he did I was a witness I saw it lost my appetite them up like what's like what would be a good like was he a good one like is there better one better-looking was young and he was muscley I mean to be honest he was two completely delicious yes but going ahead do you know the way to the to the surface we know of one place yes yes it is where all the great harvest comes we go there to gather our food and meals that come down to us from the surface world above what do you eat you eat a wheat people what What did he say like alive people are dead people they're usually bodies yes there there's a great Idol upon that he throws the bodies of the unworthy down into the cistern and we collect them there and they nourish us but you're not going to eat us are you know we'd have to kill you that would be horribly barbaric it's true it's very true eating people is so wrong hey what did he say don't worry about it oh I'm go ahead you can't understand we're talking about the weather hmm we could show you the way or we could introduce you to the Duchess yes I think we should just make our way I mean maybe we can come visit some other time and pay homage to the Duchess maybe bring some body parts with us as snacks finger foods the fish can't smile but they would be if they could yeah we'll bring some finger foods good literally literally finger foods yes please lead the way okay the great group of the fish men and fish people lead you through the sewers and as you as you're walking there the rat Prince turns to you Vance's cat goes to the cat yes yes they look very tasty you know you're mighty you know we kill them nope we could eat them yes do you want to bring the wrath of the Rat King upon you at this moment oh I'd be good I'd be good if you soil these mortal bodies of the rat God's messengers you will pay the price oh so shut your rat trap I I turned to veo and in common I say are we still carrying parts of that fish no okay good we ain't escaped on you I didn't take any with me do you still have the fish from before did you eat the candied salmon you can examine my baby made a little bit of it but you may want to like I don't know tuck that oh it's tucked it bought us wrap it tight underneath the cheese which is probably a bit smelly it's very prominent smell the smell of the fish let's just yeah don't don't bring that out or out or yeah just yeah nevermind okay we're good they're gonna show us the way out don't worry Pluto yeah I'm uh just come on you walk forward through the sewers with the body art of the Fishman and they and as you walk forward you can see that seeping down from up above in the areas of the pipelines are coming the thin mist of the delirium haze you can feel it kind of in your lungs a little bit it's like a slight burning sensation this little bit of a smell of ozone hangs in the air on which almost at times overpowers the smell of the sewage around you the fish people continue to lead you forward past several other doors and grates that see that might lead off in other directions through through the sewers and one of them at one point says if you ever wish to come back this is the domain of the Duchess she is very powerful and very wise just stay on her good side of course we would never do anything to upset the Duchess what are your names yes yeah well I already told you I'm Sebastian Crowe the Avenger of your friend and your mute friend here he cannot speak yes uh not the language of such fine people oh he speaks much lesser languages his name is gluto jackson mmm and I am veo Sonia Wow Wow yes well we shall continue you come eventually to a very large cistern in the sewer is a large open undercroft like space with several pillared sections rising up into the middle and from above the system the cistern Rises it's almost like a big cylinder like Rome and several sewage sewer pack weights are all leading in here but they're all sloping off from it and in the bottom of the cistern there are well there's a few things in the cistern so it's big cylindrical room with pillars all rising up in various ways and at the very top you can see the light shining down it's a very specific circle and bayo you recognize this circle mm-hmm it's the well of the Dead in slaughter stone square oh this is where I just turned to the fish people dig this is where all your food comes from oh yes and they point to the bottom of the cistern where there is a sea of corpses all manner of bodies slain by terrible wounds puncture wounds all of them still with equipment and weaponry on them groups of adventurers dead soldiers members of the hooded lanterns members of the cult of the of the the followers of the falling fire a few of the paladins as well other groups of adventurers even a few Caspian bodies all a are they like are they his men some of them yes was it only at home Oh slaughter stone square or was that after the incident it's always been called slaughter stone square because slaughter stone square is where all the public executions were held mm-hmm just a couple myself hey what was that thing way back when we were sleeping in the mill that was written on the wall that that itching that said don't go to slaughter stone square did it well it didn't say don't go unders what are stones all I have is this our way out looking down you can see that the cistern here the way that you've come through the sewers the sewers have switched tracks and it seems like this the cistern might be slightly disconnected from the rest of the sewer system hmm but you can see that there is the well opening at the top and there is a spiral staircase that leads along the edges of the cistern that leads to an exit above and then the bodies look like they're floating in water at the bottom and you can see at one point it looks like there's one of the fish people has been is literally taking one of the pincers and fishing up one of the bodies and dragging it off to one of the exits circle of life on our map where is slaughter Stone Square let's pull up the map I don't think it's listed I don't have a hearing on oh it's not okay there yet slaughter stones square if you see if you draw a line between where it says temple ward and the number 12 you see that there is a little bit of a Plaza on the map there that is way in the middle that is slaughter stones we're cool I mean this seems like a good place to go it's a perfect place to go up we're trying to get to the Market Square just to clarify is the water level has always been the same in here did the water level change at all in this cistern like from the okay looking around yeah yes it looked like it was much higher okay mm-hmm but you pass through enough of the sewers now that the several interconnected systems are probably all feeding into that main passageway I mean there were warnings not to go and slaughter stones square but I mean it's our best way to get to your clock tower to be fair it might be these fish people that cause them not to go well I'm more concerned about what's feeding the fish people there is a sudden crash do it in a scream as a corpse comes flying down from the well and is dropped with a large splash in the water you can see if you look up you can see that in the Sun with the light coming down whatever creature is up at the top is silhouetted but there's this looming gigantic figure covered in spikes and it's reaching over its head with a gauntleted fist you just see these two green glowing eyes the creature is huge it looms over the opening which is ten feet wide so however big this creature might be could be twenty feet tall and it looms down and reaches over its head onto its back and it grabs a body and drops it and then it reaches back and it grabs another body produces another body as if it's reaching into a sack on its back and drops it grabs another and drops it and that's landed but like thuds at the bottom that's where I'm scared of okay so it's not the fish people so we need to get to the Clocktower but seemingly our best way there is to try to get past whatever that is does it stay or does it leave it leaves after dropping five bodies down I want to check out the bodies okay yeah the water is about ten feet deep as you get down the bottom how will you do that how will you get there can I reach one of the bodies with like the cistern is about forty feet wide okay did any of them land are they floating yeah the fresh ones yeah all right what's the clip is what's the closest one to me well there's bodies in the all over the cistern of the fresh ones the fresh ones you have to swim out to get one what what are you hoping to do I want to see these fresh bodies because maybe they have some kind of clue as to what we're dealing with there who gives them to this thing I take out my rope kind of create a last Sue and I'm gonna try to like fish one of the bodies I'm gonna just fire an arrow at it with a rope tied to it yeah yeah thirth like three attempts of me like me like I can tie a name so I take my long bow out and I take a shot to try to get one of the bodies that he dumped in okay pulling the body closer towards you this man was wearing full plate armor and his body is covered in massive puncture wounds at least a dozen of them almost in a perfect grid-like pattern all across the front of his body one of them it looks like basically he walked into a wall of spikes and was impaled but looking closer he wasn't impaled until after he died can I try to understand it looks like he was killed by a the fact that something grabbed him and crushed his ribcage can I try to determine what it was that punctured him as I said it looks like essentially someone dropped a portcullis or threw him against a wall of spikes the way the puncture wounds are on his body there you know pattering like metal I'm more intrigued by the fact that he was floating wearing is a is it salvageable the armor no what about accessories the grains necklace any sort of distinguishing like whoa looking for I want to look for like faction accessories looks like he might have been the mercenary or an adventurer of some kind on his body though our two potions of greater healing yeah it seemed to have survived the fall you like you need to replenish if we do go up I might want to do so with caution and I stare at Pluto welcome to the world of Dragon hime everything should be done with caution here I just mean that by the looks of it the fact that five well armored individuals just seemed to die at the hands of this thing we are three I would say it may be equally equipped but still the odds don't seem in our favor or a bit more squishy it's true I I wear nothing but a coat mm-hmm the only thing I could think of in terms of helping out with this to figure out would be I have the option to my permeable awareness or I can use a spell slot to check if there's any aberration Celeste shells dragon elementals Fae fiends or Undead in the area up to one mile do you think it's worth it or well we could always climb the staircase and by us I mean you guys because I'm Loki and you could just kind of check at the top there's also a lot of bodies here and a lot of them still have their equipment if you take some time to use more arrows and fishin we create a system of fishing for bodies so oh gosh yeah I mean let's I think it's worth double-checking the other bodies especially that he just put in because those will be the freshest and those will give us more signs as to what that potential beast will create a pile for the fish people I was gonna say we can play it off like we're helping them it's like here we'll make a pile of bodies and we'll remove their armor and weapons so that they're easier for you to take along needs yeah it's I feel like whatever this hulking thing was that silhouette it might be too big to come down here which is to our advantage I don't know what it is I want to kill it and if it's not right now it could be later but yeah what if we don't run it we could do that - - away - just we get up and we run to the clock tower and and well I mean I'm sure we'll see this - as fast as we can we run to the clock tower yeah what if you ask the fish people if there's another exit what's the next closest things that maybe if it's not as yeah well I didn't even get the fish peoples like what's the name of the one that was speaking to me Oh my name is swampy know slurpy slurpy slurpy I never learned the pronunciation the he says as a reward for bringing back the remains of blip loop you may take your pick of today's Salvage amazing cool what are we gonna start going through it yeah start grabbing the bodies and I mean you guys can have the meat after we're finished like look at all Lego absolutely we're so generous what are we find on the bodies that we fish in well on the body of a slain mage you find a scroll of fireball yeah you you could pay night life into my ears perked up there and on the body of a slain Archer you find a peculiar looking crossbow it is magical but instead of having a Splott for a bolt it has a reel of steel rope coming off the bottom of it and a large hook in place of a bolt what oh gosh I know who this is this is George I knew George oh I'm so sorry he would have wanted me to have this and this and see what him I will take it in his honor and do what I can he also had a quiver of five magic arrows and if you take the time to examine what you have found this is none other than the grapple shot from the dungeon dudes treasure trove but you can get on the Dungeon Master's guild if you want to see the rules for it 21 unique magic items yet with fully Illustrated art I'm just doing self-promotion know there are a few other weapons and pieces of armor nothing quite of equality of Tobias crows most of it now has been ruined but if you do want to pick up a few extra weapons or certainly almost anything here that you might want to pick up I think I'll take on my liking can I throw a spear yeah maybe I'll take a spear yeah you can throw a speech fear or javelin babies javelins yeah yes how many javelins can i scrounge up decent ones 5 ok magnetic ones I just stick deer back sure like a fridge yeah magnet and it was the magic arrows and the grapple shot well we might have to add that one into D&D beyond though my notes right now in our homeroom well my old friends weapons will not be used in vain oh my god [Music] we've scrounge the bodies so if you do want to use the the grapple shot for anything they have tonight yeah it is considered a crossbow but rather than firing normal ammunition it has a built-in or retractable grappling hook and a 30-foot long metallic cord so as an action you can fire it to an open surface within 30 feet of you and it attaches to any surface made of wood or unwarped stone but it can't attach to metal work stone magical force or anything else that I might deem is like a reinforced circuit so it's got to have some purchase for it to stick into and then immediately once you fire it it reels the line in and it pulls you through the air directly towards wherever you shop the hook amazing you land safely within an unoccupied square within 5 feet of the grappling hooks wherever you shot it and then it attaches immediately speed is that considered an action it is an action to fire [Music] but because it pulls you through the air if you fire it like you won't provoke with how opportunity attacks or anything like that you can't if you shoot a creature with it it just does damage it doesn't embed into a creature but it can be fired in that way it's a kind of an still get hurt to be shot with yeah thing is it since eyes of a hand crossbow okay so yes we want to I like both ideas running up and just booking it past what we're gonna call him Gigantor that's a fitting name slam slam hands we call him the giver giver slam hands the giver okay the giver and we could just run past like if you guys want to check it out and and see if he's close by I say we take a peek and by we I mean our scout how often ask them how often do the giver comes how often does the giver come oh very rarely sometimes now it used to be in the young days in the early days there would be a rain of corpses from above as many came and tried to test their might against the giver in battle but the giver slays them all without question and drops them down for us to feed upon their ruins he is a generous giver but a mighty mighty protector too so how often these days oh it's been a while at least a few weeks since anybody's were dropped down here I mean so for just like give an hour unless he like lives in slaughter stone square and as soon as something enters that area he attacks it run away hey yo check it out okay I'm gonna go the steps do my scouting work you know however dangerous it may be just like poke your head out see if it's nice knowing no I moved my way up the ladder this is how we get back to your private but you know what I'm I'm trying to go the and the stairs as quietly as possible and I make it very clear before sir I'm like no noise what's the what's the word that says come up what's the signal pork chops pork chops can we use a visual but I just wave you up okay yeah if I go like this it means run away okay you look for it I'm gonna turn off the drift globe okay so you head up the stairs they spiral up and through a small stone building open up and it lead to a hatch that it's closed at the surface I am going to is there any hinges on this yes on the inside I want to try to like slowly open the hatch if I can okay push it open very slowly and look out into slaughter stone square it's a rainy day nice and there's a light patter of rain falling in the street below you remember this place slotter stone square was a great open plaza where there used to be a gallows built that was here where criminals murderers and [ __ ] will be home once in a while a witch or malfeasant wizard would be burned at the stake here and for those honorable enough to be beheaded there's a heads been his block there's been filth and stone on a platform in front of the well well used to be where all the refuse of the executions drained down into the sewer system but normally the bodies weren't actually disposed of down here slaughter stone square is a wide kind of triangular square and the buildings along here rise up several stories and every story of each building has a huge balcony on it because public executions were great entertainment in the a.m. dragon hime and the people that lived along slaughter stone square used to sell access to their balconies so you could get a good view of an execution I'm smart seeds make them exactly yeah so these high steep old streets all of the buildings along here are all very down looking they all have that steep point at the top almost like judgemental hooded figures to stand in the center of slaughters don't square where you're opening the gate actually feel like the houses and the windows that are around here almost silently judging you they like you've been found wanting the streets though around here are completely deserted there's the smash you look out you see the smashed remains of the gallows several of the benches and platforms around here and you can see sitting at the edge of the well maybe only about fifty feet from the door that you've opened up is a hulking machine it is perhaps 20 feet tall and you can see there's a large pair of smokestacks ones back and there is this kind of purplish smoke rising up out of the stacks one of its arms is has a fist on the end of it but then there is a massive headsman's ax kind of built out of the fist the other other fist is almost built like a giant man sir and the two and it's sitting down its whole body is covered in two foot long spikes and there are several corpses that are impaled on its back its hunched over and it has this plaited face it's meant to look like an executioner's mask this machine was called the guillotine mm-hmm have I ever seen it before yes it used to be the executioner dragon honey Oh old familiar face you know now is it is it it is a machine or does it have something inside it from them kind of what I know from the past you just remember it being a machine okay I close so it's 50 feet away close it sneak back down the street close it you can see that there are bits of dismembered bodies and blood and gore like it was covered in blood and gore yeah and there are other bodies all there's remains of body parts but entirely complete bodies appear to all be down the theater so I'm a the complete bodies get tossed in so I go down and I relay exactly what I saw to the rest of the group so the executioner's up there don't know if you ever know about that before but he's big machine very spiky very mean I doubt I could ever afford to go to a public execution in the middle of dragonhead so but which way was it facing was it facing slightly away from the door okay and which would we have to run past it to go to the clock like where was the clock tower can we triangulate this oh yeah you didn't check which direction the clock tower was I'll go back up I go back up okay you can still check 9 you open up the door you look and you see that the machine is facing to the south and the clock towers to them is to the north east but as you close the gate you slip and it comes down with a slam and the machine starts up and you can hear it you hear as you rush down the stairs you hear this battering on the grate and this almost metallic screeching as the executioner suddenly comes to life as you rush away and it and you can just hear this screeching this metallic groaning is reaching as the thing is stomping around and rushing around and you can hear it clattering about all of you even down in the cistern and the fish people say oh if you angered the giver we don't go up that way it kills everyone it's a bit angry but I mean it's probably not gonna stop sending you bodies if that's what you're worried about your food supply is still in good demand I have a plan we might have to wait a bit now for it to calm down ok and I also have a plan but you go first I can perhaps as long as it's facing away from us and it was sitting how far away from you about 15 feet 50 50 feet 50 it 5-0 oh why you need to be close I thought it was 15 feet in which case I could cast minor illusion and make a sound 15 feet in front of it and somebody running and then it would maybe follow the sound giving us an opportunity to sneak past it I mean but my minor illusion is only 30 feet so that's main not I don't think I have the distance to I mean I could still put the sound off to one side of it making it walk possibly in a direction that the opposite the way that we want to go yeah giving us a possible opportunity Pluto what did you have it depends on how aggressively far it chases the sound I think my plan is completely dependent on how fast this thing is which I don't know but my plan was veo with your ex SuperSpeed yeah if you were to grapple hook the inside of the well come out of the well and get it to chase you with your surfing just like murders things right well might that's why my hope is that you know what if it's bad if your zipper striking and agility and you run up a house or something then we could burst out the hatch but what if it hears you and you're not as fast but that's why it's all depends on that one condition how fast it is because if it's like as fast as we are if you can get it far enough away where it's just chasing you but it can't catch you we wait till it's far enough away we get out and then we book it another way and then you lose it and we back up what that's that's risky it's secure what if we combine the plan yeah so she waits down here because the thing was sitting by the edge of the well right it was so if it returns just sit by the edge of the well me and Pluto go up the stairs we creak open the lid we use minor illusion to lure it away from the well you pop out the well it turns back around and sees you it now is further away from you meaning it has to catch up to you but you're gonna run away but then it's gonna follow me and then we're going to escape and you're going to escape using your nimbleness and ability to climb now the fine like I don't get a good outcome in this I get chased by this crazy machine either way yeah Radford was so much more into these mines and totally just oh yes distract prints how fast for you oh I very quick yes yes I'm very very fast very very sneaky the most quick like very quick what you want me do like faster than a death-dealing machine I want you to outrun a machine he looks at you and says you mean that machine yeah [Music] and he says no I will not do it okay you want me be bait you want me run up there be bait get eaten no get torn apart not even eat what it killed I'm sorry I thought I thought it just kill kill kill I thought you were fast you said you were fast I'm fast but but what if I not fast enough it's not really no it's it's a machine it's gonna be well you know what we could do I mean we could use that machine it's not matter it get you once you dead well we could also like I think we need to test it out a little bit so what if we go up through the crack when it like settles around and then use your minor illusion and like see how fast it goes like study it look at it yes search we're doing research options we could just continue and try to find another way out either by I can see the clock tower we could find another safer route or we could backtrack fill the the caverns again and see if there's a way we could go through the regular rep prints way you know Jackson wanting to play it safe no Laura Jackson really wants to murder this giant mechanical monster I mean I bet you couldn't even know run it with all your armor let's go we're going I'm just like I'm ready to run like I'm gonna go up and not to fight it to run away how far is the stairway and the great the the hatch that leads up from the opening of the well the the well opening is 10 feet wide and the cistern itself is 40 feet in diameter so the staircase spirals on the outside of the cistern so it's about 30 feet to the well on the surface so the staircase comes up it's like 30 30 feet yeah like I feel like we've we've maybe you could like minor illusion at the well something so then he goes in and attacks the well and then we go up and run because he would have to get 50 feet to us if we were running in the opposite direction we don't even necessarily have to run towards the tower we just have to run away from nothing we just have to run away okay I'm gonna go up the stairs and I'm going it has the banging and like gnashing stone took about half an hour okay yeah I go up and I want to open it a crack okay and I'm going to cast minor illusion he's 30 feet away so I'm gonna cast it he's sitting right back down where he was sitting okay so he's not sitting at the well he's sitting a bit past the well essentially he's sitting on the opposite side of the well from the Oh from the staircase up okay although if I cast the sound in the well then he'll turn towards us what if you cast it so if the well is 50 feet in front of us what if you cast it 30 feet to like our what time is it I was like what's that it's the afternoon I thought he was in real life because I was gonna say we could you can use like darkness and we could just like walk through darkness I can do both right I was hoping to reserve as much of this for the clock tower yeah so I mean if we can just run past it so this door it's so with it open a crack I see I see him sitting there if I look the other way how close are like the closest buildings least a hundred feet away the plaza is on a 200 foot diameter because my groin shelf I are both at one of the buildings I mean what's your what's your most the spell that provides the most to you later can you light a building on fire to create a distraction would be good unless it leaves a trail that shows where it's coming from but that's the thing is you might see where it's shot from yeah I think our best bet is minor illusion um do you mind our illusion a thing rather than a sound I can't I can do either yeah cuz then if he sees something can it run away can it move this minor illusion I can't move further than my 30-foot range on it maybe run the opposite way towards him make it run the opposite way of us and then when we get it we run they like the complete 180 I don't want it's nowhere I can only make it small so it can't be a person yeah oh you know what help taller athletes big enough that you could make an illusion of a halfling with minor illusion i am i okay i conjure up a halfling who starts running around off to the right side from where we are of the well it's a silent illusion yeah but it's in his per if okay you can see it and we're gonna run how far away do you conjure it from him so i can do so if i'm here he is he's like sitting over here i'm gonna conjure it over okay you conjure the illusion of a halfling and the massive machine lumbers to its feet and walks over to it and it sees it and it brings its axe up and it smashes down on the illusion and then raises the ax up and see and like the acts like swishes the illusion and then it lifts its arm up and sees the illusion is still there and smashes its arm down again lifts its arm up sees the illusion still there it smashes it down again direction so if it's to the right we're like dashing to the left so we're like but quietly we like stealth run Reese are you gonna be stealth because if you're running there's no eighties what's the fastest we have movement yeah I would have your movements rather get away book it I know wait I'm not super striking yet if it sees us I'm running okay hold off on Jefferson so you run out of the sewer hatch is it's smashing down on the ground I mean timing wall finishing with the first with the first okay guys this is this isn't combat this is because this is the chase I'm not gonna put it down on the map so we're gonna do this in our minds okay okay Dale 26:20 Sebastian 21:16 you all beat the Machine the executioner this creature is known as a cadaver collector oh it seems so as you burst up out of the sewer hatch the machine looks up for the illusion and sees all of you and you hear this wrenching screeching sound it's like it's like wrenched metal and gears turning as it sees more people running out and it turns to chase after you with this lumbering kind of jog goes joke joke joke joke as it moves forward they are what are you gonna do I'm going to Zephyr strike the right Prince is not going as well and I'm gonna use as I do it my feline agility so I'm I'm getting pretty far I'm getting at least to the first building as you run out the rat print says I see you all later I stay down here across the the way Sebastian what are you gonna do how far is it from me it is 90 feet away from I'm going to just - okay you run so Pluto I - all right so you all run the kid average collector starts running towards you it is at full speed it's bonus as fast as pollute Oh but as it comes forward you see this green energy collect around it and all of a sudden there it the green energy emanates from the corpses that are impaled on its back and you see several screaming green visage and start leaping forward out of the the machine and running along with it and they all scream you could hear all of these ghostly visage just say no no you've got to run you've got to run and one of them is I'll just say please don't leave me here don't leave me here and all of these ghostly forms yelling out the last words that they ever set ever experienced also start yelling no no you've got to run you hear another one saying no they've killed George it's really a challenge as you as you see as it runs forward all of its vents open up as well and this all these gases and fumes of delirium are shooting out from all of its events is it rushes forward towards all of you what I never did that before her no it did not whoa you're like how far ahead of us are you oh I mean how far does your - go 60 so I did like 120 is my three miles I think I got to the edge of the 100 we start running and me and Pluto are just like grabbing at each other like sprinting and you're just like God and we keep looking behind it no no don't look back don't look back just running running all pull out I'm gonna have each of you make a constitution saving throw 14:23 okay you two are fine you continue to run forward and you actually catch up to Vale who's panting this she's given this all-out run and you continue to rush forward you're almost at the edge of slaughter stone square you can see the Market Square and the clock tower looming in the distance the massive cadaver collectors continues to go forward joke chunk chunk as the spirits begin to rush forward towards eat each of you and one of the the spectres are much faster than the actual cadaver collector itself and they fly forward their grasping hands coming right up towards your faces saying please don't leave me as one of them reaches into Sebastian into and it reaches forward and it seems like it's close enough that if you continue moving it'll get an opportunity it's your turn Oh how far away's the edge of slaughter stone square that's probably another two or three rounds of all that running Oh my lungs are burning but I'm gonna keep booking it okay Specter scoring a critical hit against you Sebastian make a constitution saving through 12 you succeed in any case you still take 20 necrotic damage oh god I want to take a swing at least your hit point maximum was introduced by that much did you make your constitution saving through oh can I take a swing at the spectre yes you can for attacking my friend yep ten that's miss okay swings rate through its incorporate Coryell form you all continue to run I'm gonna continue to run I'm gonna continue to - I'm like I am it touched me and I'm like I'm so pale and I look so sick and I'm also like leaving and I'm so I still I'm still her I get 90 90 feet on my - okay because of your strategy to get another 60 feet away that and it's the end the cadaver collector joke joke joke joke running forward inexorably a piece of one of the corpses on its back kind of slough off and fall out like like splits apart so that some entrails following is it as it rushes forward the specters continue to pursue you rushing forward even more and now one of them is behind pollute oh but all of you can make Constitution saving throws 18 19 18 okay you're all good so veil from before you have one level of exhaustion okay just so you know Sebastian sorry pollute Oh as you continue to run forward one of the spectres its hinging hands Li reach out towards you and it gets an 18-2 hit you can feel them they continue to scream and it comes up - it's like whispering you please don't leave me you have to save me you have to leave gross gross gross is the last round of running keep running we are almost what are you gonna do I booked it okay yeah one more set of Constitution signature sixteen twelve twenty-four you're all fine Oh breathing heavily you burst down the street into Market Square and as the massive cadaver collector gets to the edge of slaughter stone square it stops abruptly all right and the specters come right back to it back towards it and it looks at you with fire and hate in its eyes I feel like we don't even get a check why you don't go to slaughter stuff that's where I know I feel like we just keep running a guy yeah running like I'm weaving through like left's and rights and go through a door go at the back door I know this part yeah so I know where to take us I'm like I want to say that I did something brave but I think in this situation that I'm in like part of me is like I want to turn around and make fun of it but I'm getting like no it it almost killed me just by like now is this scary that'll be the time that it comes out of the square and still chases I think like once once I noticed we're free I just like dive onto the ground and start just like your soul is like hot you you were haunting something lived inside you first yeah you're at now the south end of the Market Square the wide plaza the deserted streets and all you can do is scream and laugh that you are a lot yeah it's like that weird delirium talking now I just like I go into a fetal position instead of crying I'm on defense like I'm looking around constantly like 360 making sure there's like not a specter that's like following us still I'm so exhausted I'm just like I'm done let's find it let's find a little house to kind of hide in I don't know broken like crawl to the nearest house like something just to sit down for a moment and catch our breath yeah step into the edges of Market Square Market Square is the largest open plaza even larger than slaughter stone square you see a sea of ruins in front of you ruin market stalls from a massive open-air market which once was the heart a commerce trade and life in the city this is the south part of the market the stalls are smashed many of them burned over you can see the corpses of the people of dragon high still scattered about just like as they were on the last day of the city 15 years ago some of them are little more than ash some of them untouched from the passage of time the south end of the Market Square is the great clock tower the large stone limestone building towering up looking down through the massive glass and iron clock face its high steeple towers and leering gargoyles once your sanctuary in the city you can see how its highest tower just pokes above the haze which suffuses and rests over the entirety of the Market Square you scream laugh and exhaustion the echo carried in the emptiness of the Market Square you've survived slaughter stone square and you are just outside the clock tower that's where I think we'll leave it for the rest of the night have enough rate for one night you need a quick nap I need a nap I need I can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs so yeah the egg was my soul I I like the
