aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon hein we begin once more where our story began at the old Eckerman mill the creaking windmill broken down to time roiling in the wind around the makeshift campsite of the hooded lanterns the Caspian and a few representatives of the amethyst Academy what was once a lonely and abandoned hill like a grave marker in the midst of the Karen Hills has become the last camp of our heroes and their allies having fled the city in the wake of the rattling revolution which has seized and caused untold chaos through the outer reaches of the city and resulted in the hooded lanterns fleeing their barracks which I have held for some time on the flipside our heroes have now assembled from the clutches of the queen of Thieves the badges of the small Council of Drakon hime with all seven in hand their path to the throne of Drakon Hine is clear but they have not only the sigils of the small Council but a potential heir in hand as well as the young Prince George has traveled with his grandfather Saul Jack's Saul Jackson to the ruins where the Caspian have formed a small campground there's only a few dozen Caspian that are here but now but they have built for themselves a fortified camp with wooden barricades and Palisades all around and large tents to protect the perimeter of their own camp they haven't shared this area with the hooded lanterns who have made their own sort of makeshift camp of their own that is quite less defended than the Caspian zone accommodations but the hooded lanterns have been working to dig a ditch and build up their own fortifications around this sort of makeshift fort now that is being built around Eckerman mill a few miles outside the city the long day is over and you have recuperated from the events of the past few hours rested over the nights and as breakfast begins in the camp meager meal with a few bits of local wildlife a few rabbits that the hooded lanterns were able to hunt down in the fields and most people are avoiding eating any rats or other rodents though and what few provisions they've been able to find from the city itself I just want to point out that there are Rangers don't need no glamping if we were up it in the wild dis fun all right okay but when you're don't be complaining about like back problems and the go there you know I don't want to go on my watch because I'm so sleepy when war comes the Caspian czar in their luxurious campsites I imagine that a Sebastian Crowe is just standing in the mill looking down at the carvings the the Jackson 3 which is cross cross that with the three crows which is crossed out with the veil and the pussycats which is crossed out and it has the list of our former team with rat food Gimbels and chubs crossed out and then cut which is crossed out and then veil written next to it and Sebastian and Pluto really come full circle a you know we meet here first and your last people got eaten by rats grab food it's all connected and now we're back in chased out of the city by that's truly time is a flat circle [Laughter] do we have dragonforce written can we do a cool dragon for us now I take my claw and I start to like H it into the yeah because because this is like this is it guys he's been the three of us for a while now we've survived we did so far my one goal and I was kind of worried about it the last time we kinda set off from really the first adventure I was concerned I mean you did I mean you always got eaten by rats literally in our in our first mission together and our second mission like you would think that I'd have like kind of like a fear of rats but if anything I've grown accustomed to empowers being eaten by rats like I'm actually pretty comfortable with it I mean if you're gonna die I guess it still sounds like a horrible way to go I'm not gonna let you get eaten by rats I really appreciate that kill me please instead of letting me die from raps I don't know if I could do that well one of them okay well I'll just blow up all the rats had you that's better okay okay alright for me and the rats it'll just be as I eat them they'll eat me and it's just a circle circle we horn sounds in the morning signaling the start of a meeting between all the leaders that have assembled here the in the midst of the Caspian camp they've made a large bonfire outside where they've arranged several places for everyone to sit and discuss so that the plans can be made for what to do next uh do we need to worry about anybody scrying on us during this at this point I don't I don't know I think the Queen I think we're already enacting the Queens plan that's a paladin I'm worried about well we could what about your little tiny Hut it doesn't block just to say a little tiny but yeah it doesn't I mean it's it's a pretty decent sized man I'm I didn't mean to shame your side it's just a tiny Hut not a little tiny Hut okay you're teeny tiny itsy-bitsy Hut it doesn't do anything great from it doesn't it does enough include how it doesn't nothing okay I'm scared my nephew and you did you rant you went on he asks a question and I gave him an answer I I'm sorry you're not good with kids I'm is what I'm trying to say I say guys sit down around sorry sorry sit down right where I am I said I said I squat okay trying to look all like intimidating as I'm like the Lord Commander well let's go to the meeting I guess we're needed at that meeting yeah huh horns okay as you file into the meeting each of you is brought separately to sit with those who you are considered a representative of veio is led in with the hooded lanterns to sit with the lieutenant commander Petra and Ansem Sebastian you with Eldrick and River who are both here and Joe as pollute oh you were brought with Jupiter and greeted by your father Saul Jackson and we do a Caspian handshake which is way more Flair than you would expect your father comes up and as you would expect Saul Jackson is a barrel-chested man he is perhaps pushing 90 years old himself but you would not know that for he has the bearing of a man of 50 he has this full head of hair which has been very clearly died and is every much as large a man as Pluto and Jupiter he wears a large carved breast plate that has pecs and abs and has this huge cloak with a stripe around it and where's the diadem of a Grand Duke of caspia and then across his breast and all padded on it are all these metals from all the campaigns that he has been on and all the all the various a litany of all the military victories that he is won over his over the years most of them against other Caspian I turned to Petra I'm just like how many calories do you think that guy has to eat a day to stay that size he's got that like he's got that like Schwarzenegger kind of look yeah and he has this big butt rooting jaw but unlike the the more clean-shaven Jupiter Jones and Pluto who's got the stubble Saul has this big flowing almost Gresham beard that just curls right out and he has like this kind of curled lock and in in his die black hair and he's dyed the beard as well and it just it just is all these curls that come down around and as you come come forward the only thing that you notice is that he pockets his glasses and puts on and a fur for a moment he has to squint to make sure that he can tell the difference between pollute oh and Jupiter father ah my son and we do like a big hug where we're also kind of like sizing each other up at the same time like it's like you're kind of squeezing really tight yeah be like he grabs the back he says you might want to work on your triceps boy have you been doing your dips and curls no father a good exercise regime healthy body healthy mind yes Father it is good to see you too just like she's always like this he's always just checking out my traps [Laughter] hey caspian man's body is like his temple it is where he worships although I see that you've been dragging it through the mud of this city but all for a good cause yes yes Father I always appreciate your lessons and it's it's just good to see you it's good to see you too now remember to shave it's not right for a young Caspian man to have such stubble you either grow a full beard or clean-shaven and mother as well I try to change the subject your mother as well she sends her love thank you and cookies you ate them of course not I'm on keto you look great every time I see you I'm just always amazed yeah it's more like a carnivore diet you just eat like just meat just a meat diet am I always on that diet yeah you yeah I think I sent him I was like this works really well 10/10 dragonhide tips to save you to lose weight fast to keep toned and I heard Sebastian's got some great weight loss tips it really just involves sitting I just I'm thank you for making the journey I know that this is it was kind of last minute and you kind of sent me here to figure out what was going on and I'm glad that George is here with us because I feel like we're we're in our final moments this is everything that we've kind of worked towards over the past 15 years it's true the as we work together here the having the Judy the Jackson name behind the throne of West Omar will ensure that we our family claims the throne of caspia as well in the next election and with both the thrones of West Omar and caspia our house will be at the beginnings of a great Empire like one that hasn't seen been seen since the old days what you've done it's been father to a glorious new nation thank you I'm honored to serve my country my house and my family I hope I have done you proud well done my boy but the works not done yet Oh gotta kill things indeed and I've gotten really good at it since you last saw me I've killed at least a bridge of minotaurs I've killed at least two trolls I've killed what else have I killed armies harpies a tower of harpies at our Harbor yes there was also a courtyard of paladins one courtyard of paladins wait wait wait tell all the men of your great deeds boys this is my son Pluto Jackson and he is a hero and slayer of monsters and I have these are my these are my great companions I who have aided me on my journey my court wizard Archmage of Drakon hi my name is sebastian crow Eldrick is about to stop and my what was it my messenger muscle and muscle the audio you were the what was the Lord Commander the Lord Commander but what was the other name I gave you that you were the that my my speaker at one time Harold Harold no I was the Harold were you the Harold I'm confused Harold and muscle vo Senya I heard you aboard commander of the hooded lanterns Terre cookies in your bag that you brought she's owned out after have you ever had caspian pastries no Caspian baking is known across the globe I mean I love any baking but I'm sure it's the best baking so I should definitely try some secret is sugar what if that seems obvious men I have killed monsters big and small friend and foe I have slain them easily and with great difficulty and now I stand before you ready to slay the next thing in front of me no no no the Lord the former Lord Commander Elias Drexel speaks up and says if you'll forgive me well your deeds are grand we've got much to discuss the situation has become very dire let's go sit down yeah seated about the campfire now are the the Caspian 's the amethyst Academy and the hooded lanterns off to the side in a carriage that has been drawn up for her looking out from behind the curve of the windowed of the of this carriage is the Queen Mother Lenore watching out she is as though you were brought up to speed that she's taking quite ill since coming out of the city and is not well so she is withdrawn from this meeting and now you meet to discuss the next steps as we begin this meeting I'd like to take the opportunity to just take a moment to see how thankful we are for all of you as allies to come together and help us with this I think Drakken hime will be a great city again but only because of your help there's a general nod in agreement and say here here Elias Drexel continues the situation has become very dire Lord Commander Lord Jackson's Lord Jones mages honored mages but we can still but we have the keys to the city in our possession no one has mounted an expedition to Castle dragon in years years ago I attempted to explore the castle with some of my men and we were driven out by the monsters and the defenses of Castle dragon for while the creatures that guard the castle walls the ancient gargoyles and Dragons they would not attack me for I bore the time the seal of the Lord Commander but they would not obey my commands I can only assume that this is because whatever has happened in the intervening years has meant that the entirety of the council is needed to call forth an heir to fully recognize the power of the city that's my best guess that's what we've been hunting for for years now we have a good hand of cards to play in order to get past that point we not only have the seals of the council but a potential heir we also have that letter saying who the next heir should be when's the what when's the right time to open that I think no time like the present I mean I'm asking the council everybody in this room knows that we have that I carry with me the will the last will of the king of Dragon hime and I present it and I wha wha wha wha wha what telekinesis it into the middle of the table hopefully not into the fire show who should though this letter is to be opened in the presence of the council in its entirety so we still need a flame keeper and a steward has Eric arrived yet we have word that he's only a few days away because it was Eric our steward yes yeah and we still look to seek the help of Lucretia Lucretia Mathias that's gonna go over well unfortunately a flame keepers are few and far between at the moment this is true Saul Saul says never had a good religious folk well never brought them on any my campaigns lesser commanders would think they need counsel father you you are right however in the wake of the new Dragon Heim we must do our best to repair the old ways for if we Forge this new great land without everyone's approval the council we may seek backlash from the other Nobles right okay yeah yeah you're doing great Thanks I've never said this far before Jupiter Jones be something you speak truly if we don't if we don't make sure that we're completely in control we have to get the backing of all those other lesser Dukes and Nobles there all throughout west of our let them know who's boss I it's about balance balance of the city balance of thought and diversity of thought I think this is why the badges were made this way and it's why we need to have who we have on the council it's good to start new track and I'm off on a good foot and be proper and right about this we don't want to cause more division than we already have so if I have to be correct our proposals are as such Pluto you will take the role of the castellon I the office of the Lord Mayor will be filled by Sol yes the office of the guild master by Jupiter and the steward by Eric yes and the office of the high flame keeper - Lucretia Matthias yes as long as we can make a an arrangement an arrangement she will be asking says Elias Drexel it's clear she has been excommunicated by the hierarch at the very least she will be asking for protection but she could ask for more I mean at this stage we got to protect ourselves from the Paladins as it is the silver order is going to be marching on us so offering her protection just makes sense she stays in this city and represents this city then we're protecting everybody that represents Dragonoid Eldrick interjects you do know that by inviting Lucretia Mathias to serve as a high flame keeper in a new Royal Council that constitutes a recognition by Westham are as of the falling fire as a legitimate religion and splinter sect of the sacred fire there's been splinter sex before of the falling or of the sacred flame there's many religions that have stemmed out from it I don't like the way this one operates but perhaps in our agreement with her I think we're all hoping that we can lay down some ground rules or something we don't have many options if you if you have something better to bring to the table than Lucretia Mathias I'd love to hear it by where yeah we are open ice it's the enemy of our enemy at this stage Lucretia Mathias is maybe mad but she's wise and powerful she could be a potent ally and her words hold great sway with the common folk I'd help to have the common folk on our side with the spread of delirium in the city she might also be a way to help make it part of the city whereas the paladins have made it very clear that they only intend to destroy it as long as if Lucretia Mathias and her followers are willing to work with us they show no interest in destroying the Delirium they wish to harvest it and use it in whatever their practices are that's fine the Academy has no objection to that as long as our allotment is secured now we'll be part of the deal we make hopefully I can't speak to how lenient Lucretia will be in the past she's she's kind of seemed like it's her way or the highway which seems to be very reminiscent of the Paladins as well so I think with any of these religious sects there are going to be compromises made to achieve our goals is it possible that there's an upstart in her ranks could we stage a coup within her own forces see her death and then put someone more controllable in her stead it's not the way I want to go in with it in mind but I'll keep my eyes out for I mean we're going in there to talk to her and we're gonna go meet her at her dwelling we might be able to get a lay of the land I won't say that we're gonna look to execute that option but if there is disturbance within their ranks and there is a majority of people who don't agree with Lucretia with and there's an opening to have that be a potential I will weigh those options it might be something we need to explore after Saul speaks up and says oh sorry go ahead I think the best thing we can do is go in informed about her and what her goings on are in her group and I pull out the file that I got from the queen of thieves and I say I'm gonna do some reading before we go in just to make sure we have all the facts and know what our options are with her and I put it back excellent there's general agreement amongst the Caspian Xand the others and Saul who has been overseeing this meeting it says in my estimation then you three shall go meet with this woman negotiate with her secure that once you've secured her position I propose a scouting mission an expedition to the castle I've discussed extensively with the your lieutenant Lord Commander and he believes that the grounds of the castle are too dangerous for us to bring young George until we are certain of the threats that makes sense I think scouting out a viable way in to make sure before we bring him but the way we've seen it he has to come if we're going to succeed so I agree with the scouting mission beforehand but there will be a time where he is gonna go Eldrick replies indeed there will be but we might be playing into the queen of thieves hands by bringing him immediately and directly into the castle I have a plan how tall is George he is a boy of 14 so but he has a cat he is part Caspian so he's about 510 I am going to seaming so that everybody that goes into that castle is George don't I love it but don't worry there's a protective barrier Eldrick you've protected us from scrying right yes I have put forth protections in the area I mean if you didn't then what kind of a yeah yeah Eldrick does no privacy and so he has the are to be area as as befits it against intrusion see guys I know what I'm doing yeah no I knew that sorry it's a temporary ward like he has to do this each day but at this stage he will be doing these protections and he contains an elder it continues I believe and I agree that that is a good plan for when the moment is right but I concur with Saul and the Lieutenant Commander that bringing him directly to Castle Drakon sight-unseen is a foolish and reckless course of action Oh we'll do the scouting mission I agreed I think even maybe for the scouting mission could we make someone look like George to make sure just in case we ever however you want to ensure your stealth as you go in I'm sorry I believe we at this at this stage the other problem is making sure that Georgia is protected here in the meantime and we have very limited resources from which to do that you have some of the best fighters and spellcasters that I've ever met that's gotta count for something indeed we do says out Eldrick I agree and River and I can River and I have negotiated with Saul who has commissioned our services from the Academy directly yeah dad's got deep pockets is what he's saying the other thing I'm thinking is and I turned to lies Drexel I'll say you said we could buy some men we can I could go in to go with the contacts and spend some money and we could hire some more mercenaries if we need more support at this stage was that for the castle or the war for the war but I'm thinking can we get them sticked out on the outskirts of the mill to prepare to protect the mill security yeah it could be valuable might be the way that we have to spend our tuna I mean Lord Jackson at this point if we are all in on dragon haim I would be on opposed to using our resources towards defending this city and that's only my like you guys are just as part of that so that's my I'm more than happy to put any resources that we've acquired towards the the city give us a night to think well talk tonight about what we have sleepover else'll I haven't seen my family since I arrived yeah stop we're interrupting [Laughter] [Music] Lieutenant Commander you said that you you took an expedition into the castle once and didn't make it very far because the monsters drove you out indeed can you elaborate on what sort of monstrosity Zi faced just so that we can prepare a little bit at the time there were minotaurs massive beasts you can't defend at the castle walls and seem to be wearing the wearing and wielding the arms and armor of the old Knights of Castle dragon that's up so okay that's creepy there were quite a lot of them and we were driven off they were using even the crud of the old basileus from the armory as handheld weapons we faced a few of them back on the bridge a little while ago didn't go very well we had the badges and that was before we had this staff or anything really in the time since we have sent a few and myself I've tried to scale the walls the issue of course is that like the rest of the city the gargoyles that are part of the walls of the outer walls are also a part of Castle drakon itself and so those who attempt to scale the walls or go over them draw the ire of these old protectors including I've never seen it but you know the dragons on the top power bats I've seen you've never seen them in the same place twice have you things I've been living here yeah okay we have badges so we should be okay more of a question than a statement that was a question yeah yeah yeah right right right right Eldrick interjects to say that should have been true for the executioner of slaughter stone square - shouldn't it enough but not the influence of delirium the erratic magics have scrambled the old spells that were put in place we in many cases the old spells that protected the city are still active and those spells much like even our own Tower they need to be undone and redone we have to turn it off and back on again classic that's how you fix it that's I deal with all magical problems it's far off and on again that the badges will permit you to access and open doors that would not open otherwise but the defenders and the magics and other things in place they may or may not heal to you by presenting the badges and speaking your rank you may be able to control them you can try to seize control over them but whether or not you will be able to maintain that control is only going to depend on your will [Music] our wheel is strong depends on my will is pointing towards but in this case I'm strong we are powerful it used to be that in the old days if you encountered one of the creatures of the last you could hold your badge and say in the name of the King I your name and then your rank command you command you it was a strange feeling when you tried to do it using the badges it was almost like a portion of your focus was taken from you and I remember the Archmage mode era once explaining to me that the effect is not unlike concentrating on a spell and so mechanically speaking you can use the the creatures that are native state that are native to castle trackin the defenders a power of all the badges is that you can cast dominate monster at will on one on the creatures of castle dragon ok you have to concentrate on it as a spell but all the badges including the staff of power have this ability that you can target one of them and attempt to do it and if you work if all of you work together to do it normally if one of you tries that the creature gets advantage on the saving throw if two of you tried together they don't get it over to all three of you target a creature together they get disadvantage on their saving throw ok and we have to speak what's what's the title that I or the Castellon you are the high mage and the Lord Commander all right and you have to bear your your badge in your hand shouldn't be a problem and we're still tuned to it correct yes I would assume you have to be a tune to it this has happened so yeah basically any of the constructs of the castle you can control in this way and if you encounter a creature that would otherwise have some sort of immunity to this effect by by virtue of its creature type in that that that's that's all ignored just some creatures maybe but some of the defenders may be more resistant to this control if we all three of us do it whose DC does it go under then the DC is determined is is is a fixed DC 17 okay cool I have a ring so I'm gonna be doing like cool ring things sure I have staff so it's pretty easy yeah you've two rings finally almost way our jewelry since he got here and learned some new spells - I got another ring Eldrick is says we would need to bring you back to the tower to give you your new ring it's like a ceremony don't you remember all right I just pull like a spare ring out and now I can feel cool at least with all that santhi I believe that you three should go meet with Lucretia Matthias mm-hmm are we coming back here after certainly okay yeah cuz we have to be there so I guess I don't have to say bye to my family yet if you want to born i leaving prints code machine yet no yeah Petra and answer says we send a few runners all ready to give a letter to Lucretia Mathias that you were coming perfect um what time of day is it more it's the morning you've had breakfast now and you've met Howell we meet for second breakfast and we've already had one I'd like to before we leave I'd like to take a look at this file on the crew Shaw yeah you know you what you've gathered there is I think entirely valuable to the situation and it'd be important to know some of her wants or desires before we go into this negotiation also before we go I could contact my mom and ask her about Lucretia Mott the worldly help did they know each other maybe mm-hmm maybe she knew of her what would you like to know about from the file anything about her past yeah what you want to start with her past and see if there's anything here from the early notes left by Kat Lucretia Mathias was born on the along the coast of West Tamar outside a small town called hillock and her divine powers were discovered at a very young age and she was brought to lumen only at the age of 7 where she was closer and trained as a priest and flame keeper she was very studious she rose through the ranks very very quickly and served as the high flame keeper in several cities throughout West tomorrow and Illyria and at the time the queen of these has some interesting notes that say she was very close with a philia read and so her notes of that make particular note that the two of them had a very close friendship but they seem to have had a falling-out did you say anything about that falling out that that it happened when Lucretia published her book the tenants the the testament of falling fire so she knows about the the the goings-on of what a flame keeper is meant to do what is lean keeper like does it say anything about or do we have anybody I can talk to you about what are the duties of a flame keeper the the flame flame keepers and high flame keepers are the supreme like the head priest of a church of the sacred fire so a an a high flame keeper is usually one of what would be control so they're usually the ones that report directly to the higher arc themselves so the Lucretia Mathias has had correspondence and met the high arc over the years and in fact Lucretia of Mathias she would there have been several hierarchs throughout Lucretia Matthias's lifetime and she's been one of the the high flame keepers that has had the rank to vote for the higher arm and in fact what you can see from from these notes was that prior to all prior to all this that Lucretia Matthias was considered by the diet of the flame keepers to have been before she broke off to have been a front-runner candidate for a future flame up for a future higher arc okay and the end this is largely in recognition because one of the things the queen of theis has done is collected documentation of all of them the miracles that Lucretia Matthias has performed okay right stating that Lucretia Matthias is is without a doubt basically in cats notes the most powerful flame keeper short of the hierarch to be born in a generation Wow okay yeah because she records that as one of the things that Lucretia Matthias has done is she has performed the miracle of true resurrection which is to call a dead body a to call someone who has died back to life when nothing remains of their body when nothing remains yeah and that is normally a miracle that only the hierarch has been able to perform right because one of the things that is known that there's also like noted in cats notes is that the high seat of the sacred fire increases the power of the person who is the higher so if so or she's attained this love so just just to just explain that basically the in-game mechanical terms whoever is the higher arc of the of the sacred fire is equivalent to a 20th level cleric but only well there in the high temple if they leave the high temple their powers are reduced to whatever they were before but cats notes basically say that Lucretia Matthias is as powerful as the higher arc in the temple without actually being there I see a lot of benefits to getting her on our side most of all if one of us doesn't make it there might be an option if we have her working for dragonhide one of one of her other notes says that Lucretia Matthias has also summoned an archangel named makida who is her personal bodyguard Makia Makeda we could use an art change'll could we not get hurt so I mean they might not get along with my powerful as the higher are could be yes if she was the high arc again or not again but thinking about long-term goals imagine what she could do well she could number one make the falling fire a legitimate sect of the of the sacred flame not just legitimate but super powerful here here Katz notes also indicate also basically you don't have a copy of it be you he evidently didn't find it but apparently from reading over Katz notes it seems that she has completely read Lucretia Matthias's Testament and she has some notes in the margin saying like she's incredibly well she's incredibly articulate and people say she's crazy but there's a good chance that she's not there's a good chance she's not but some people say she's crazy and like the queen of Thieves own notes are saying that like better that people think that she's crazy because because if anyone actually in Katz own words she says it's best people thinks that she's crazy because if people actually read what they would be saying they'd be hysterical the things that she's talking about are like she's like some of the things that she's talking about our end of the world stuff it I I got a copy of her text didn't I yeah you haven't read it but why are we spending like before we set out are we spending another night here mmm I would do some information digging I'm gonna read this entire text it's probably gonna be really boring would you like me to read an excerpt yeah I want to sit in on this but only if we can picture us sitting around a little campfire in a and and me reading out loud like it's a fun story for you guys and very you can have the dossier yeah and I'm gonna have Ignatius because I need to repent in her writing she writes st. bragdun was a humble Smith turned criminal who cavorted and conspired in his very cell until he was called to the light by the Archangel Michael the first paladin blessings upon her was a Craven wench a bass and lowly harlot and mercenary until she found her holy calling she was called liar thief murderer and worse until the day she followed a falling star to the place where she was called to righteousness by the Archangels that day it is said her purple heart turned gold this falling star has come from a place of utter and complete darkness a world beyond the Stars and one truly without light of course it is corrupt yet it passed into our world through the sacred fire which shields us and we all know the flame consumes unrepentant evil utterly anything which can pass through the flame has Grace and goodness in it still thus within these stones is the spark of redemption itself that is the mark of a truly noble soul the stones teach us that if we are to that we are to love and embrace the fallen the downtrodden the Craven for only from such dark Souls can the brightest flames blossom it teaches us that no deeds make for a righteous soul there is only faith in goodness that does so our faith leads us to great deeds because we become a vessel for the sacred fire to do it's good works in the world we do not work the light the light works through us said Sebastian I am scared at how much I like her now then I did but only because the queen of Thieves the woman who tried to kill me many times said she was cool and that makes it all okay and that's what's even weirder for me did you like that that makes so much sense and even talked about how magic came into this world and how you know Alric ok mitad that they used the magic even in all of its evil to they harnessed it and she's basically saying well if the sacred flame couldn't destroy it because it destroys all evil utterly then there's got to be some good engineering and the paladin's are just scared of it yeah I could say that about anything no you can't because if it's utterly evil it could be destroyed well that that depends on your views on the sacred flame ok I mean you have a flame and you have to be destroyed I utterly destroy things to flame all the time just because you say a magical mystical evil rock passed through some flame and it's inherently good on its core what proof do we have I guess the proof is that people are jamming it in their chests and surviving but that could be a mishap of magic I am a man of magic not a man of faith I believe which is the weirdest thing I have ever heard you say I believe in in magical powers I believe in supernatural abilities from hell son I don't agree with jamming crystals in your chest and saying that it's for the good of mankind not saying believe it all but she's not wrong okay I pull I pull forward powers from from the the shadow fell and like we've talked to a demon but you know why we're if the gods been this whole time manipulating the rats well okay we have yeah they've been there I mean we have no we have no proof that Lucretia Matthias speaks for anybody but herself she I'm not I all I'm saying is is that there is there's threads of truth and honesty and I feel like my earlier dismissal may have been in haste I I can understand that do you remember when we stood at the gates and - Lucretia Mathias is like oh my god she was like what is Sebastien Jam a piece of delirium in your chest and I was like oh that could be a good idea because it sounded reasonable she's really really good at sounding reasonable we just need to tread carefully yes I I can't say that I trust her completely she says faith has to you know is more than action but faith can't inform actions against others for the sake of faith so I think I understand more based on reading this but the Paladins did actions based on their faith as well and look at where we ended up with them and I feel like the Paladins are being manipulated by the hierarchy so they are less about using the light there they're doing what she said can you court that last part again yes we do not work the light the light works through us the paladin's are using or the hierarch is using the Paladins to gain her it's a her right yes yeah her in higher she's you she's basically playing a political game whereas I feel like Lucretia in all of her failings is doing what she believes is the actual yeah right yeah Lucretia has a lot of other things that she talks about in her Testament about things that basically the rest of the Testament in addition to like a theological conversation is basically her laying out all the ways in which the organization of the church is wrong like she says things like for example all the flame keepers are women and she says that we are all everyone should be able to be a flame keeper she says things one of the other things that she prominently objects to is that is this notion of the clerics and flame keepers of the sacred fire have been selling their spell casting services to anyone that can afford it to pay for all of the expenses of Illyria basically and she says no we should not be doing that that we should be giving out our like this is a gift that we've been given and we should do it use it how it is meant to be used she also just discusses how quite prominently that the fact that the hierarch has basically seized control of the government of Illyria and is de facto acting as the ruler of that nation even though bills she and she draws the comparison basically says outright like the hierarchy and the church have made our our faith no better than the amethyst Academy they basically have like a mage King in essence that's her argument yeah yeah it's just that they're they technically not mages because they're using divine power they have divine kings and queens I mean I a lot of what Pluto's saying is kind of thinking out loud yeah and it's just that this it's kind of this realization that I mean as we stand with other heretics you know what we're doing with drakon Haim is going against what is currently considered the religion of West Tamar so you know she is another heretic against this religion it's like I'm saying that we need as a rebellion she's a rebel and I give her props just don't go joining the falling fire look I can put whatever I want much because you recommend Sebastian not to are we gonna have to play some intervention quarterback I mean for the record you guys are the first ones to pump delirium infuse things into my chest you're not wrong so I do have a question about the her works is it say anything about humans versus two backsies being able to kiss two backsies we don't marry miss question she doesn't seem to discriminate at all but she is very opened up to to all people and even even notes how one of the failings of the the Church of the sacred fire is that their entire clergy is human women just say interesting do you guys think we have enough Intel she's expecting us anyway so I mean like there's we're not sneaking in we're just gonna go knock on our front door yeah we we come as our representatives so everybody be on your best behavior well I want to also use this moment to kind of as I as Sebastian's reading out loud I want to be kind of like holding Ignatius and and if he really truly does seek the light and he is the firestarter for the light my hope is that he can understand that repent hi I did not wish to spill the blood of a paladin and even even great warriors can miss stride off our off our the the chosen path Ignatius whispers to you bring me before her you will meet her cool we seek the truth you go to leave the camp as you head along the road you were greeted by the the old preacher that you met weeks ago with a group of the following fire the man named Abraham Schaeffer he and a few others nod and say we received word that you're coming we are to lead you to Lucrezia much appreciate you have a way to get to her through the rats know she is meeting you us outside the city she has found a safe place okay okay so are you having your app problems as well we are but our faith has shielded us good we still hold st. Salinas for now okay but we are unable to make our way back into the city but through her grace Lucretia Matthias can part the way for herself she is strong in faith and strength thanks leo yeah guys I gotta figure out what spells she's casting cuz I gotta learn them she can just walk through the swarm of rats on her own I mean it's not faith it's got to be magic no barriers or something yeah I'm gonna learn I'm gonna try to learn I don't understand the difference everything's crazy to me it talks to me I don't even know what's happening Oh Pluto my sword Stern whispering to me that's normal right no oh boy but I assume it's a magical sword I'm listening that's okay is it What's it telling you yeah I know he's you're messing with you're messin bit more am i who are you looking at Pluto who's out there from the camp the priest and his followers lead you through the Karen Hills to Anna belong abandoned crossroads outside dragon hime there amongst the Timbers of what remains of several buildings is an old Chapel to the sacred fire a small one a simple rectangular building with a small altar to the sacred fire maybe only enough for about perhaps a gathering of 50 people it's a very humble building that perhaps at this crossroads here where a few people gathered they would worship from local villages when they still survived here and the roof has completely collapsed in the doors are smashed off the windows are gone the building is just a shell basically and Abraham Schaefer says she'll be in there let's go mmm he wants to take point I'll uh I'll go forward right behind you and I walk up to the broken doors hello inside at the altar making a small bonfire and about to light the altar is Lucretia Matthias there is a silver cord coming out of her back and trailing off behind her into nothingness and she is garbed very simply as you saw her before in white robes with a black habit with the own the symbol of the sacred fire and that she of her modified sacred fire which is that of the meteor itself and she carries the copy of the Testament in her hands and she speaks and says welcome I will relight the flame here and she speaks a few words and the flames of the altar light up causing the fires to dip around the room I have waited some time for this day when you would come and we would talk once more well things happen for a reason and there's a reason it wasn't before no all paths led us here Lucretia thank you for meeting with us there were many paths that could have brought you here and many paths that stir you away from them well the flame reveals the pathways ahead we can only let the light stretch so far into the unknown you must take a step into darkness for the edge of the light to continue and as we wander through darkness it is only with time that our destination is revealed well we don't walking in darkness for some time now me most of my life yeah thought you had so loud I know why you're here we got a job offer for you [Music] I will accept now we need to discuss the ins and outs of accepting this role indeed you will become part of a team meaning that all the members of that team need fair and equal contribution to what jock and Haim is going to represent there is no single person on that team who is in full power your religion which will become a certified religion of West amar that's that's going to be helpful for you but there needs to be some regulations there have been many in the church and without that have found new life and meaning in our teachings we will organize as we see fit but we will render unto the crown what is the Crown's as long as the flame is given its due I think we were led in the wrong direction when we worked with the paladins and i think based on what i've learned from your past you've come head to head with them and gone a different path than than what they taught and i think we're learning now that they're not all they say they are the many of them are noble but they are taught from a very young age not to question their orders or the order of the world itself they do not see how a raging flame changes the world they only see how a contained flame burns brightly they do not see what happens when it is allowed to be free o silent it was it's always on silent mode turn it off of silent mode to watch a video of Joe now this done I have been one request [Music] your new king must join my flock George what does that pertain he will be given the teachings that we have learned and when he is ready he may take our sacrament I know I went on this big rant about how I'm really liking her so if we are to be the religion of this new world is it not appropriate that this new king take it up as well I think that would be a question for the king he is a he is a man a young man but if he intends to hold the ruler the the rulership the the crown of Jack 9 he must decide for himself well then I hope he makes the right decision I think it's unfair to force anybody into the religion I think that that needs to be one of the stipulations that you shouldn't have the option to force people I am NOT forcing him I am saying that I will help a king who follows our religion I think also intention not saying that he should be forced into it but if it is going to be the religion of the city should not the ruler set the example yeah I have to agree with FeO as as much as my earlier concerns I had fears before but as I listened more this is a necessary step for the king of Dragon hime you're gonna let George I understand him in his chest no no he he is but a boy of 14 he cannot take the sacrament until he is of age that is our tenant okay I just think if he's ready to step into a castle full of dragons and danger and this seems like this would be a drop in the bucket is it not enough that he chooses to acknowledge your relation or your religion as a valid religion in our city being a member of the Council means that you are being represented by the king whether or not all the members of the council follow it it doesn't really matter you'll you'll be represented and he will stand for that but I think him joining a religion you need to make the decision to join the Council of four we've put him on the throne my young man you should understand that there is a difference between being merely tolerated and being supported may I ask the Krisha what as you served as high flame keeper for other cities what were your experiences with the royalty and their following of the flame less than pious and I would hope that with this young George that given there's time in his education that he may rise to be a faithful and flame fearing servant of the sacred fire and of his people and if his people he must know more and more people our hearing our truth yes we have heard I have one question and this this can change all decisions going forward if George decides to follow the faith and take on the sacrament will he be imbued with magic he will be imbued with faith these are different jinx we cannot have a king on the throne that is a mage in any way shape or form regardless of it if it is divine or if you know if we end up with a divinely powered person on the throne we have a chance of becoming no different than exactly what you fought against with the hierarch the sacrament only emboldened the soul it does not [Music] affect the mind okay in that way it does not create it does allow one to access one soul in a way that you could not before but is it magic certainly many things are magical in this world but it is more miracle than anything else the lines of miracle and magic blur quite often speak your mind to me they are very clear I mean you you know I have issues with this but I mean a few months we've been traveling together all I do is speak about the issues that I have with things and look where that's gotten us so Pluto Jackson it's your nephew we need a flame keeper and I understand that we need a flame keeper do you think that this is the right path I think it's not my decision it's George's and if he chooses to follow your teachings then so be it but I I can't I can't say yes you can take a throne and no you can't follow the faith I feel like he's either it's all or nothing I can't have one without the other so I have to let go over my concerns and my fears and let him decide now I am gonna speak my mind just as a side thought you say that there's a distinct difference between being tolerated or being supported yet there are laws in place saying that I can't teach George magic why should it be different for you the amethyst Academy in most cases is just tolerated I'm hoping to change that but why do you why do you get to act differently than me and what I represent from my perspective I do not see why you why the Academy should be merely tolerated either okay it's it's it's okay these are good questions I'm not saying no I just I just want to make sure for once in my life perhaps it might be that the Academy could learn from us and we could learn from them you I think are both interested in something similar just from different perspectives the stones and I think knowing that the stones are here in Drakon Heim that are a force who says that we can't come together over this this thing I will share with you one thing you may show this to your young prince and if you wish to show this to your mage friends this is the power of faith this is the power of faith and the stones she opens up a satchel at her waist she reaches in and produces a crystal it's a piece of delirium but it's golden and it glows with golden light and she holds it with her bare hand what sorcery is this can I see it and I hold my two vacci hand oh it's warm she puts it on your hand if I touch it it is safe what did you do to it yeah that is from a dear friend of mine that was the shard that he held in his heart and when he passed that's what happened to it in your teachings you talk about this the [Music] Purpleheart turned gold finding righteousness that is a righteous soul huh would you agree to allowing me to just examine this a little closer certainly careful it's her friends soul yeah I just sorry asked that's my ass well they're gonna keep talking I'm gonna okay identify or detect magic well I think magic will just tell you it's magical identify will tell me so once one who has learned can't even speak with them I mean you're the sorcerer yeah speak with it hmm I I like to step off to the side and I open up my bag of holding and I start pulling out like equipment and like magnify have lenses for my goggles and I'm like examining it and I'm gonna cast identify on the crystal yeah it has a powerful aura of observation and conjuration magic and without a doubt this is a vessel that holds a human soul and I detect like none of the things that I would normally have detected in delirium like it's definitely delirium yeah but it like doesn't hold but if the poison or toxic basically its operating on the completely opposite arc like wavelength magically speaking to what delirium does it's like the best way to describe it would be anti delirium I do delivery you just hear me in the background just be like oh my oh my oh my oh my and I come back and I um intriguing says I think I trust her from the deepest darkness comes the brightest flame you see when you see things like that again I get really hopeful about myself and it's just like I want maybe hope isn't a bad thing you know maybe I'm thinking about what what could be done with this could this person be brought back in a new vessel and I hand her back then she takes it and she's she says one day when the light must spread throughout the world we have always said in the sacred fire that those who have fallen will need their bodies but perhaps we never thought about their souls where would they come from where would they go in this form they are now sacred charcoal by which to light the sacred fire anew what if this is the Sacrament in its purest form what do you mean could this be put in someone's chest I have not considered to do that yet just I meditate on that question and what it would mean does it mean to join two souls to take one's faith into one's body so many questions okay I do want to when if you if it's okay I want to present someone wanted to meet you it's very close to me he's at my side Ignatius oh yeah and I'm gonna remove Ignatius and just kind of spin him around and do that hand it off she takes the blade rage sword and she says I have spoken with the spirits of the true vo and our gana we have taken their bones to st. Salinas maybe we can restart the flame maybe we can call them back what you think you can do that I have faith I have heard of your miracles and now and only now do I have faith am i jamming delirium in my chest right now am i doing it all right you guys are you daring me to do this like some time no nobody dared you to Jim - okay I'll do it she don't she speaks for a moment she takes Ignatius and she presses the piece of anti delirium tooth blade I said I'd take a look she speaks some words of light and you can hear her speaking in the celestial language I understand it she's almost speaking in tongues but she's communing with the spirit of of Ignatius and as she finishes the blade ignites with golden flames whoa and she hands it back to you ask him if he's okay how you doing big guy the blade does not answer she says I have calmed his spirit he will be with the flame can we use this to bring back one that I have murdered you wish to bring back Theodore Marshall are you sure I think he deserves it actually Drock I think he his path was he walked his path he was a righteous man if a misled one I hope that his spirit rests with the flame yeah if we bring him back then I have to explain to him about what happened afterwards and I just I just nearly concluded I have one more question for you hmm go ahead if George agrees because it is his choice he will then be I think under scrutiny and potentially danger from the high arc are you and your followers willing to protect him if he figuratively sticks his neck out for you if the faithful wish to fight for their holy king it is not my place to stop them what about you though we if the faithful and their King have an enemy in the old church then your king will have a grand army indeed before we conclude this meeting I think it's important that I make sure that we are all in agreeance and on the same page so I've made a note your the parchment list yeah I have a list here we can we can discuss these but this this is what I've come up with here you will follow the order of the council in the word of the king you will share Delirium with the Academy the Academy has a rightful claim to the Delirium as well people may choose your religion but can never be forced into it you may have a place in the city to operate that you may not propagate outside of that Cathedral your religion will be known and those seeking your religion can go there to find you and that will also be a known fact that we can spread does that sound agreeable that is suitable okay well spoken Sebastian yeah thank you I'm trying to be a big boy that was good trying to make some is this a good decision guys are we making a good decision is this gonna work or we can I mean I think by I think in the presence of who could be our new flame keeper I think we have to take some faith and we've tried and tried and tried to plan before it always just goes so sideways and sometimes we just gotta trust ourselves and this seems to be a path that's laid before us I think we're both we are both moving towards a common goal and against a common enemy of the hierarch and i think beyond the borders of dragon hime if we can solidify and organize and we'll connect together through this then we can move on past our borders to help make this world a better place yeah okay Lucretia you and I actually have more in common than I think different paths but you were taken at a young age because you discovered your powers and you've raised in the ranks I stumbled through the ranks but I I know what that's like and I know what it's like to be an outcast and then to find your path so I'm trusting you to let the rest of us do our jobs and we'll let you do your job and we'll do it together certainly walk with the flame walk with the flame walk with the flame I will prepare myself to come to the castle when the time is needed you're gonna know when that is I can send her a message to you I think she already knows I got this which is kind of nice like we don't have to bring her in the telepathy bond thing come I have all to learn some of your spells there's these miracles that are given to me are gift from the flame if you embrace the flame then the flame might bestow them upon you I've been I've been embracing flame my whole life honey has a lot of a lot of people who would have been able to vouch for that but they're mostly dead now anyway I'll see myself that all I think so okay we shall see you soon um we'll bring the badge you bring well she come if you come to the mill we will present you with the flame keepers prayer beads very mean dr. George did she talk to George yeah and you can will make sure that George will very well I would like to counsel with him so that he knows the decision he is making he's an impressionable young man so don't like go off on him okay all right uh-huh all right all right with that you depart and we will take our break there and we are back from our break before we get back into it I want to give a big

underscore dudes there we go again we also have a phenomenal discord community where you can join us there if you are one of our patrons and you can chat with us about all things relating to dragon high or D&D or nerd things in general so come hang out on dis card with that let's return to the ruins your negotiations with Lucretia Mathias complete you head from the crossroads the old tumbledown chapel back to the camp at the Ackermann known what is your next move well you said you wanted us to talk to your mom I mean that was going to be about Lucretia Mathias but I think we handled all of that I think really just before we set out this is just the scouting mission right we're gonna we're gonna come back from this one right yeah the plan totally survival is the name of the game how we even getting to the castle it's kind of full of rats the city yeah I can get us there you can get us there yeah if we have badges flying over the city is less dangerous is my understanding so I mean we flew here right I can carry you guys to the courtyard at least or the approach to the castle how many people are we bringing with us is it just us for the scouting mission is just the three of us Dragonforce I mean that's what I was thinking were you thinking Bale did you have another idea I'm just thinking yeah I guess the smaller amount of us the better but I was wondering if it we should take like two or three Rangers with us that's up to you I was thinking that since we're scouting we have a better chance with I mean we suck at stealth because of certain people's and ability to be stealthy but we could work on it yeah I know I mean they are like that is that something you're working on what but I think should we get a telepathic bond passed with Eldrick and yeah River can we fill up our rings I know I used one of those spell slots yes you can but you're only gonna be able to get spells from Eldrick and River because they're the only ones here can they give me shield yes they can how many do you need what one okay yeah River can give you one may I have a misty step yes River can give you misty step Thank You River you're welcome I'm good I have one elder can River create a telepathic bond with the three of you is there anyone out and themselves is there anyone else you would like in on the telepathic bond hmm should we just be able to relay messages to the the council as it were yeah I think that would be yeah how many people can be in the telepathic bond up to eight I think we could just do the whole council the lieutenant commander your father but we can choose who we talk to right yes it like walkie-talkie yeah the way that we've been running telepathic bond is that you can communicate telepathically with any or all so that basically you can choose when you send messages who receives them and who doesn't okay cool yeah that makes sense in your dad my dad my dad that's right sobbing a good name Erik but he's not here yet well do we want Jupiter on the line or two he's not really that I have him on the line but we don't have to specifically relay messages unless we need to River aldrick Jupiter's saw probably Elias Drexel a lot of Tennant and then three of us yeah that's a river Eldrick Jupiter saw and allies yes sounds good okay okay do you guys let them know how the meeting with Lucretia went oh yeah yeah we probably come back we hold a meeting and explain the rules that we set and that she agreed and the stipulation that she said I'm gonna pull George aside and kind of give him a pep talk you're gonna be confronted with a choice choice is yours it is hinging a lot hinges on this choice but I need you to understand that it is still your choice and if you do not feel comfortable following her faith we will need to find a new flame keeper but that's something I will stand by salt guffaws and says if I had a medal for every promise I made to a flame keeper I wouldn't have any room on my chest I have a very white chest Pluto where your medals dad I okay I left them back in Cass px I don't want to get them dirty yeah they would have or rats ate them their luck Bush I think we could have someone put your medals in an envelope side and bring them there's only two of them what medals were they most likely to get eaten by rats and most men lost on a mission it was one for killing my first troll it's just like a Caspian boy scouts or something yeah that's a leader it was I I don't like to talk about my medals it's pretty medal I was I was just messing with you I'm sure they're great medals and I respect you listen you deserve like 20 more for what you've done in Drakon I'm so I will make you some out of random materials that I will choose and you'll have to wear them medals don't make it's the man I take like a piece of cloth and I just like I right good guy on it and I put it on your armor and does it fall yes mine will be edible just slight yeah yeah well that didn't work I pick it up and I put in my pocket good I want to keep it so how are you going to get to Castle dragon we're flying on an eagle we fly like an eagle okay [Music] I mean you fly like an eagle I ride you with bail yeah I go animal handling I'm going to cast do I have it in my ring can I toss it on my ring nope okay I cast polymorph okay and turn into a giant eagle okay so we step outside of the tent obviously and I do my shadowy thing again where shadow explodes out of me into wings and then I as it's happening I jump on your back George before you're fully transformed I face plant and then immediately like I'm like blue don't know and then I turn into a bird is George there George watches with bated breath at the sight of Sebastian geranium and I point my finger my clawed finger and I say no Sebastian realizes that he never said bye to his family so he sees his family there and he turns you know that means goodbye and then he flies your father wipes it's here my boys gone bird crazy allergies yeah he's allergic to birds all right take off and I say carrot top family I hope to see you again I hope you see Sebastian - haha okay so as a giant eagle with both pollute oh and and bayo on relax it's very heavy but basically Pluto's extremely heavy but veo is extremely light so your able to fly with both of them on your back yeah your your you take to the skies and store up over the city of Drakon Heim as you fly towards the castle the as you fly over the cities choked with mist and just under the clouds the as you fly over the city walls you can see they oh you see this first you see several gargoyles break away from one of the towers three of them and they soar up towards you screeching in dissonant tones the ancient masonry that that is their body almost with a flash of lightning animated and they fly up in pursuit of you what do you do I cast minor illusion to make I know it is can I can I use my own voice when using minor illusion to it says I can make like a yell or yeah yeah okay so it can be your voice so I with this booming voice in the sky take off my badge and I say in the name of the king I the Lord Commander vo Senya commands you and I pointed out towards them okay so guys get your stop help me God it gets it fails it's saving throw and you've dominated one of them I say put up I point to another and I say in the name of the king as castellón of Drakon Heim I plural Jackson command you the two gargoyles are bound to you now by this by the magic of the of the seals but the third is still not controlled what will you do i command the other way to crab and plummet to the ground yes I take evasive maneuvers okay I drift lazily to the left Sebastian why don't you roll initiative just real quick and I'm just gonna see how the gargoyles do twenty-one so are you basically commanding the gargoyles to grab it and just drop like rocks yeah okay yeah we go yeah yeah that's a baby okay so the gargoyles both of you can roll strength checks for your gargoyles and I'll roll one for mine you get a +2 I got a ward 313 I got a five so VAE owes gargoyle grabs the other and just puts all of its weight against it it tries to wrestle back roll once more for both of you ten ten eight it loses two both of you yeah and so it draw the two gargles dog pilot and they let their wings go and the single gargoyle can't hold the weight of two others and they fall and are destroyed by the fall thank you George this ring is so cool I resumed standard flying okay there's a little bit of turbulence yeah you'll see on your right giant gargoyles chasing the left rats are eating everything yeah you you can see that there are there's a lot of rattling even from up above here here and there although it is during the day so they're probably not out yet you fly over the city past the tower of the amethyst Academy and the clock tower past the spires and the estates of the nobles district and over the old town part of the city that you actually visited aside from where aside from the the old the old administrative how where you killed Theodore Marshall and you fly up the rise towards Castle Drakon as we fly I'd dip my wing into the mist just wanted to make up I can show you the world and I do this and I and I put my arms out and I go I love you rose I mean I you you hear telepathically smashes just like is that your wife's name and say your wife yeah maybe that's my that is my wife's name her name is rose is it that's Cannon and I love her a great castle the great castle dragon perches atop a cliff at the heart of the city the castle has imposing stained black towers that are chopped by high steeples that are sharp like spear points the roofing is all made of copper so it's kind of this green sheen of on all the rooftops there's a massive central spire that rises out of the keep decorated with more intricate stone gargoyles carved in the shapes of dragons with their serpentine necks leering down from the battlements coming closer to Castle Drakon as you come close closer to Castle Drakon the whole building is a palatial and sovereign fortification built in the glory days of the great kingdoms of old upon foundations which are said to vin lane laid in ancient days by the Dwarven earth masters of the old of old times there are great towers and parapets soaring balconies and overhangs flying buttresses high arched windows immaculate carvings of stone and copper rooftops turned green with age and there and throughout you can see the great oak indoors found in iron and filigreed in gold there are innumerable towers around the castle itself for Castle Drakon is both a fortress and a palace it is divided into several sections for in fact it has two sets of walls defending it there is an outer set of Bastion style earthen walls that at one point in the history of the castle the old castle was built and that an extra set of walls were built around it by actually carving out the mountainside the the cliff that it rises upon and so it is almost a they call them with diamond walls because they jut out in triangular shapes around the castle forming firing bastions that were designed to withstand even arcane machinery and magical blasts because the walls themselves are built out of stone and across the foundations atop these are the curtain walls 80 feet high surrounded by towers that range from anywhere from 120 to 160 feet in height all around forming the outer walls of the city of the castle itself which itself is then divided internally into the upper Bailey and the lower Bailey so the the veil from your memory you remember that there's an internal gate so from the main gate house you lead into the Lower Bailey where most of the Armory's administrative buildings and the servants buildings are and then you go through another gate another fortified gate house where there is the upper buildings of the castle as well as the keep and the castle gardens themselves as well and then through the keep itself is one building that stretches out in almost this elongated shape that then has the central tower rising out of it all told there are over a dozen towers around castle Drakon and several larger buildings abutting the walls and then leaving these large open courtyards in the centres of the of the to Bailey's from your recollection there are several important towers in Castle Drakon Vale the great tower is often some kind some sometimes called the tower the tower of stairs because the highest tower of Castle drakon is literally just that it is a massive spiral staircase that stretches all the way up the keep itself and then continues up and into a high lookout point it's the largest tower and the one upon which the Dragons are perched not connected to the main keep but part of the inner Bailey is one tower that you know very well it beyo it is the stewards tower and that was where you grew up for that is where your father's of your father's old apartments and offices were look it's the house how does it look it's a here I'll do this in the in in our heads um I mean it's looking like it did 15 years ago but maybe older that's probably got my stuff in it do you want to where do you guys want me to land there are each of the gate houses so the the outer walls the bastion walls there's a drawbridge that leads up front from them to get in and then you go through the gatehouse of the main the first main gatehouse and the way the first main gatehouse actually works is that you have to go through the gates lead you through a tunnel which ramps up into the lower Bailey so you actually go underground to get into the main Bailey itself first and then from the lower Bailey there is another gatehouse which itself has a drawbridge and then is another tunnel into the upper Bale again it's a complete in terms of sieges it's a complete deathtrap because both of the tunnels are layered with murder holes and have their own draw bridges and then they keep itself has its own outer fortifications and its own drawbridge as well so there are three sets of drama to get to the keep there are three sets of drawbridges the other towers that are quite important but not attached to the main key are the airy which is where the king's flock of giant owls were kept and then the the other buildings throughout you remember as the Knights Manor the ladies Manor the servants Lodge the armory the stables and then there are other administrative buildings and warehouses throughout the the castle all said Castle Drakken was built to be able to accommodate thousands of people and had storehouses inside that could allow it to endure a siege lasting years well this is gonna be easy to scout veo we I have to defer to your expert opinion i've sieged only a handful of keeps in my day and none of them as complex as this and with your intricate knowledge of growing up here like where do you think we should start I'm a how smart I am again we didn't say this cat I know no we just you grew up here it's not smart that's just history into the castles and the main gates there are there there are there is what is called the postern gate and there are there are servants entrances into the main castle as well um we probably don't want to take like the main road in would probably want to take maybe some of the servants entrances and to kind of scout out and see you know where the side entrances might have been just point me and I'll go I'm also thinking I point in a direction I dive towards that direction we should think about where we should establish our main operations when we do bring everyone including George well we need to make sure we find a path to the throne room and if we can clear a path to the throne room then we take that same path yeah the next time we get here yeah but let's land outside and in one of the maybe inner courtyards we'll see from there as long as we can get out again all right there specifically there's the upper belly and the lower belly the upper belly being where the keep is located would that be easier to fly out of you can fly to wherever you want because you have flight but right now I'm assuming that you're just looking from at this at the castle from a few feet from a several hundred feet away I'm like circling around it yeah as you circle around it you notice that in the Bailey's in the Bailey courtyards the ground is blackened and covered with ash for in the air around the castle there are flakes of they float in the air like ash but they are flakes of delirium and there is a thick haze that hangs almost like a bowl of soup in the court heart courtyards and the Bailey's themselves and from that as you look you can see that the ground of the courtyards has become ashen and gray and there are great rents in the earth we're something very unlike what you've seen before has happened in other places in the city where you've seen pieces of delirium especially large shards there have always been signs of craters but through the courtyards of Castle Drakon from the air you can see that parts of the earth have cracked open as if the shards of delirium jutted up from the ground there are massive pieces of delirium in the courtyard and growing up the walls of the castle themselves through the latching onto the insides of the keep parts of the outer walls and jutting up out of the ground itself through these shards similar in size to the ones that you saw around the amethyst Academy but again it's like they've broken up under the flagstones of the courtyards and shut it up out of the ground themselves the curious are still is that there is what looks to be there there is pools of this purplish black liquid forming around around where the pieces of delirium have broken up from the ground and it's pooling out into these little rivers and deposits all throughout the courtyards and it and as you look it rides slightly and in some places it's begun to streak up the castle walls like moss stem stands revenge guys I hate to say this but we're gonna have to land in one of those courtyards and not only that but this is a this is a mission where we're supposed to be gaining intel on what we might face in the castle so we know so not only do we have to land in one of those courtyards but we need to figure out if it's how dangerous those courtyards are do we have some aqua exper go that's yeah I'm thinking yeah I think it's time we pop the cork jam it into my Eagle heart it's a drink now isn't it oh yeah they made it into a drink a pill the drink it's drinking I it's my own your gullet it's in my bag okay we'll do it when you which is also a problem well I have one yeah yeah you all at least have two doses oh yeah cause to get into and yeah so I'm gonna give two I'm gonna draw I'm gonna drink one and I'm gonna feed one to giant eagle solution okay don't bite me one thing about this DeLorean that the jutting out from the ground can I tell her based on my knowledge of the castle what rooms would be underneath the sections where I see it mainly jutting out from in fact there would be no rooms under there just the earth yeah yeah gee because the the underground components of the castle that are there are tunnels underneath the castle there are dungeons in Drakon Castle Drakon the dungeons of dragon high roll credits but but in the courtyard is particularly the lower Bailey mm-hmm there there's not a lot of stuff underneath there it's solid rock because it's built that way with the knowledge that if there were fortifications under there in a siege one of the best things to do would be to tunnel underneath mm-hmm and then try to blow things up so the one of the the major defensive features of Castle Drakken is that the whole outside fortifications what's actually underground there is not that much so the this could have grown where they've grown up from there's flagstones there but moat for the most part it's solid earth where where they came out of but the Delirium came from there yeah earth and how far away is this like from the meteor ex crash it's it's far like this almost seems if this is I'm trying to tie this together to the idea behind the Academy where we saw well only we could describe as delirium growing before like what if this delirium has been underneath the city and it's only coming to light cuz the meteor hit like we saw the the staff of power had delirium in it right like can we deny that I think it was there no are you orcas had someone it's been around the meteor brought some - yeah delirium has been on this planet for a long time it's it's a theory worth exploring or you know we can start by harvesting the castle stuff yeah yeah that might be a job for the amethyst Academy to clear out this castle courtyards and maybe start there - the haze in this area first so what are some options that we have to land based on what we can see so we have the two Bailey's yep if you want to I mean you could land on the roof of the keep you could land on the top of the tallest tower if you want to try doing that there's defenses there there what could happen doing that and how you're gonna get out is up to you right I can circle around you can see that the draw bridges have been lowered across and in fact there are you can see a group of minotaurs coming back towards the castle and they are bringing pieces you can see that they are hauling a massive piece of delirium with them intercept I'm just gonna say the less minotaurs there are when we bring the group here the better and these ones are separated from the core castle there's only how many other there are eight of them that's a lot maybe I should just maybe we should figure let's follow them as Giant Eagle yeah and see where how far they go in do they close and open these draw bridges do they have some sort of signal maybe we don't even see other people that are yeah that's a good idea counting right let's go take us moment to scout is it Giant Eagle sure nobody will know doors approach the castle and one of them produces a horn which they blow and there is a sounding of drums inside as the main gates of Castle Drakon Thunder open again as I said the gates themselves and the walls are built that the walls themselves are very high but then the Bailee inside is also raised up so when the Minotaur's go in through the gate they go through this tunnel and then come up a ramp inside the courtyard itself and from what you can estimate from the entrance to the exit of the ramp is about fifty feet and it curves gently upwards they come out and then they proceed towards the the next gate house as well maybe one of the towers would be a good start to land yeah what's the tower that's closest to the main keep the aside from other defensive towers the closest tower closest the tower is the stewards tower and veil you know that there is an underground passage that links the stewards tower back to the main castle why don't we go right to vales old home then she could navigate us from there don't touch my stuff it's been 15 years bad stuff it's nobody's stuff anymore they let it again to my face I mean in my head I you're on my back if you attack me right now it's gonna look bad for you Vail let's go I have magic let me help me okay let's let's go okay I okay and I kind of like aim it out with my hands like the top left yeah so the the stewards tower is a high tower on the attached on the upper bailey off the gate off the gatehouse and it is this tall building that the bottom of it the way that it's built on the inside on the inside per the wall there's actually this manor house that abuts the bot the base of the tower that is where the stewards staff and personal servants used to live and where he had his own dining room and library like the stewards tower is a man is a little manor house unto itself and the steward had his own staff and everything here but then the tower itself rises up and then has this high set of battlements and then a smaller Tower continues up then it has the copper roof on top so you could land on the rooftop and all the little rooms up at the top that was where your bedroom was we had a very high high bedroom up there up there and there are and there were balconies jutting out of them that you could you could land on the balconies to your room to your father's room or on the Battlement tower themselves all right let's go to my original points me to the balcony to her room and I fly down and I perch on the balcony okay you fly through the balcony and there are a set of doors and windows that are that are here on the balcony you can see that there is this almost frosted mist across the windows looking inside but there is a there's a doorway on the balcony that is locked and I believe a oh you still have the key after all these years of course I didn't want to keep everything yeah either way I could have like unlocked my way in these matters as these two getting off my back I'm going to use my keen sight just to keep an observant eye on the surrounding area to make sure nothing is paying too much attention to us I'd all roll a d6 one one one you all rolled once why did we do that or it's a seven you already there a one or seven I can't tell okay well there's only one thing that can happen now boss fall we all die as you land on the tower there is a great mechanical roar that howls through the air this is my bedroom you must make music to the great stair tower as you see the great bronze gargoyle dragon on the top of it rear its head back and howl with a mechanical roar it echoes out across the city and can be heard for miles away it is thunderous and the tower shakes as the great bronze dragon of castle drakon awakens from the tops of the stair towers it digs its mechanical claws in to the battlements as it unfurls its massive wings howling backward it lurches from the top spire of Castle drakon towards the stewards tower and as it does so several five smaller dragons leap off of the castle tower and join it in flight in formation as they sail towards you what do you do do we run or try the badges pork chops I use my insights Sebastian do you see my 8uc make me turn my head sideways and one eagle eye the pupil goes big I think it goes small and then it goes big again and then I I go those dragons as the dragon comes towards you you can see this pieces of delirium that have grown into it its eyes alight with crackling bit bolts of purple energy can take they could that form a radiant corona of purple light around its wings and as it sails forward bolts of purple lightning pull down from the clouds above Rican tickity hitting the lightning rods on the tops of the towers and actually they ricochet this bolt of lightning between all the dragons as they fly forward toward towards you my instincts my survival instincts are yelling no flight a flight inside but no get inside an eagle story I'm not flying get inside got us inside destroy my home what's the worst that could happen huh this is the worst that could happen I I mean are you are you an eagle still yeah are you not flying you guys are taking too long to decide roll for initiative Oh guys if we abandon the mission a giant dragon that we don't want why are you why are you fighting us on this God Lulu yeah now I rolled poorly on initiative I argued well I'm the one of us to fly us out of here I mean how you can hurt yeah you can teleport right yeah so in all encounters in Castle Drakon hassled rackets a turn Oh guys we could take it we're level 11 now I've been itching you some spells can you make us look like dragons we're like oh god you're like rare according to ancient tales this dragon was carved in the likeness of - orange the great bronze dragon and his brood okay what you got veo 25 25 Sebastian 8 8 Pluto 14 14 okay so the whirlings go last Sebastian Pluto castle Drakken - are on and they is our order so veo you are the first to act - Iran is a proc approximately 380 feet away from I locked the door I yell we'll see if she misses if anybody will listen I mean are you listening to us no well there you go and I'm the singer the doors themselves what kind of doors are they the this is the door to your bedroom they're made of oak filigreed with gold and bound in iron and decorated however you like dragons can't go through Oh crane and that's that is the great oak oh my god you said it's got delirium coming out of it yeah yep I cast its 380 feet away [Applause] Mayo's on your front lining up the shot sharpshooter yeah all right line up the shot and I take one of my magical arrows and I shoot at the Delirium on it okay 60 feet 15 arrow what are you shooting with your longboat okay so yeah you're well within range the arrow sails towards it and as it does so it does a barrel roll and deflects the arrow off of its wings can't even see what's happening bonus action have you fired your second shot to Zephyr straight okay I'm gonna fire my second shot with Vantage 23 that is a hit well lyrium on the dragon music a magical arrow you can hit the Delirium but it damages it as normal because it's part of a creature yeah all right [Music] Oh I get three [Music] mm-hmm [Music] 35 already 35 damaged bits of metal and gears fly out as as the arrow crashes into the dragon's breasts and it continues soaring towards the air towards you is there anything else you'd like to do additional weapon attack yep you got one more ambusher yep 18 19 it deflects off the faceplate of the dragon oh oh boy okay and from here we're on a balcony you know I see any other balconies you would need to clot you landed on your balcony for your room which is there's a balcony on the other side of the tower one level lower which is your father's balcony well I don't think I'm gonna make it there get in and but you could also leap down approximately 40 feet to the battlements below to the battlements of that because that again your bedroom towers are jumping up by two steps right so there's a Battlement where the tower widens I run towards my door and I'm ready Mikey okay Mike inside yeah you can use your interaction to open the door yes I want to do that yes okay and run inside sure what does your bedroom look like it's very sleek you remember it yeah it's covered in a thick layer of dust definitely I'm like it's it's very like neutral colored but has pieces of like a drawings around and like lots of toys cuz you're like ten right yeah yeah when you're wiser so the first thing that you notice when you open the door is that there's a cloud of smoke filling the doorway is it like delirium smoke it reminds you of the smoke that covered the windows of the amethyst Academy interesting I keep is there any there's a door going I guess into the inner you remember that it wasn't this black before but castle dragon is warded in the same way that the Academy's warded against teleportation and scrying but because we walked in and we had a key you know you're doing okay alright I try to get as far in yes possible as possible so your old room occupies most of the tower there's a large hearth and your old bed and your old wardrobes and everything and then there's a doorway leading out to the spiral staircase which goes back down which leads down to a hallway where your father's room is and it leads one more up to the attic level of the tower I'm going to just use my feelin agility to get as far as I can okay you what's your total speed this this level of the tower is only about 20 feet in diameter so you could very easily go quite far down if you wanted to technically I can get 110 yeah you could almost run back down to the main part of the tower if you wanted to I get down to the main part of the tower okay follow me so you crash down the stairs and vanish out of sight [Music] the dragon at the end of your turn uses its legendary actions to move forward 40 feet and then it takes its turn and it dashes and flies a total so it is now covered a total of 200 feet forward it is now a hundred and eighty feet away from the tower itself now Castle drakon takes its turn and you two are still outside yep yep okay a bolt of lightning comes down from the clouds above both of you can make a dexterity saving throw what hello 15:22 you both succeed but you still take half damage so that you each take 10 points of electrical damage that was unexpected I'm gonna use my shield - okay Pluto it is your turn I run inside because me no likey fight dragon on tower okay and I - as fast as I can down the stairs okay mostly fall down them sounds good you - a cross of AOS room possibly trampling some of her old toys you don't know this you're like a thousand miles and I let out like a caspian like swearword cuz I'm stepping on like ya goin careful and I just start booking it like basically tumbling down the stairs like taking them four at a time okay it's dragon - dragon - dragon stirring a dragon sebastien it is your turn I start backing up and I I so I should try the end of blue toaster and the dragon spends his next legendary action to move another 40 feet I don't know her closest is 140 feet away good I start I actually so I unburden an explosion of feathers I turned back into sebastian on the balcony and i twirl the staff of power in my hand and i look at the dragon and i'm like i'm here to do a job dragon and you're not stopping me and as i'm backing towards the door i whisper to my staff of power and i go please don't turn me into a potted plant and as i back through the door i'm going to cast wall of force across the balcony like yes encapsulating yes nice cool alrighty once again because of the total and complete influence of castle drakensberg reom I'm gonna have you roll twice on the wild magic table and then I will choose the result 98 98 okay I don't remember what that was 92 okay come on come on good they're both really really weird ones if you die within the next minute you immediately come back to Lysa that lives as if reincarnated no one and the other is you're surrounded by faint ethereal music for the next minute which one would you like I'm just gonna roll a d6 because I well I mean it's possible that you could die in the next minute so that might be advantageous knowing the way Sebastian's feeling right now it's possible if you die in the next minute you will be reincarnated alright so I feel I feel like powerful and as I as I cast the spell part of like you can see like purple energy flowing through me as this like purple barrier goes around the outside and I back through the door holding the staff of power out concentrating on this wall of energy to stop the dragons from entering tripping and there's a clattering as you as you jump over the plates that vayo left and Allah and I stand back up and still try to look and I move 30 feet okay so you're on the stairwell okay the wurmlinger Aegon's all fly forward and they try to keep pace with the with Big Daddy dragon there and with that we go back to the top of the round with veo you have come down the stairs quite a bit you are now in the main level like the there's one spiral staircase that goes all the way up and down the stewards tower it would lead all the way out or all the way down and so the top two levels that you were on were your father's room and then there was kind of your father's study and then there's another level that's on the same level as the battlements that was more of a sitting room and then with how far down you've come you're underneath the Battlement part of the tower almost on the same level where you could get out onto the castle walls if you wanted to from here and here on on this level are some of your father's personal offices but again the the each because of the way the spiral staircase goes it's like a hallway of staircases so there you then have to open the door to get into the room on that on that level as it as it spins down through the tower I just telepathically quickly say guys what's the plan here I don't know there's a dragon coming at us and I'm just running down the stairs I'm protecting us from the dragon we're here to investigate the castle well let's investigate the castle by being chased by dragon the Dragons outside is it gonna stay out there yes I thank you I slow my pace down the stairs I go from like the tumble and then I start like to a casual jog and then I'm like now I'm holding the handrail and just kind of like taking it in just calmly walking and you see me kind of entering the stair while holding my staffs I'm on it okay making my way essentially down as far as I can I want to make it to like a bottom level even I consider like the walls of the it the Dragon can come get us there so I just want to keep inside as you pass down the stairs you pass by the door to your father's office you hear a faint word sound of a familiar voice and it echoes down the halls and says the hell and I recognize this voice mm-hmm and I stop immediately and I turn around to where the voice came make a perception check 18 the echo came up and down the halls but you think it might have come from behind the door but it doesn't didn't sound like it came from someone speaking behind that behind a door I rush up to the door and I open it it's long and dynamic you know you would not have had the key for this use of these tools - okay unlock it yep and your deck security 18 18 the lock opens and inside is your father's office it's a well appointed Bureau with lined with several bookshelves and those type of cabinets that are like that are wooden and almost filing cat they're basically wooden filing cabinets where he kept all all the documents and all the important administration for running the castle your father as the steward was he was in charge of payroll he was in charge of counting you know he was in charge of grocery shopping smart guy and as his desk is there papers scattered all about through through the room and you can see on the desk there's a pen on the desk floating on one of the pages writing on one of the pages back and forth back and forth and then one of the pages flies out into the air and then the pen starts writing on another page and it flies out into the air and the pen starts writing on another page and the pages fly out into the air and tell there's the swirling of pages all through the air guys 17 rounds later we felt that I step cautiously into the room step into the room and the pages begin swirling around you almost like they're they almost form into a row and swirl around you and this is you this is you man it's close and the pen continues to write furiously another and then one of the drawers opens up and a bunch of pages fly out of the drawers and several of the the drawers on the desk open up and pens jump out of them and begin writing on on the pages and scrawling all across them I reach out and I grab a page what does it say run and another says get out go never come back do you reckon another page flies into your face you pull it away it says there is nothing but death for you here veil leave and it says veil I'm just stuck I'm standing that's what I do is I just look at the papers I put on my goggles and I use one of the charges just to look into the room you see the outline of an of of a man he has a crook a hook at almost aquiline nose and these big wide whiskers and the slightly ball a balding head and he's grabbing the pens and he's writing on on them and as he locks eyes with you and he says can you hear him in his mind says get out of here you fool and vanishes I explained what I just saw they'll pay jizz fall to the ground and the Pens drop to the ground I I describe the man to vail was that what is this place van was that your dad guys he's here he needs my help I can't I can't leave him here I'm finally finding where he was he was here when the meteor fell we need to find him based on what I saw did I see a ghost or did I just see a magical like it was I able to get our kind of check 18 it was an unseen servant yeah what I just saw was a magical representation of your father I don't know what that means I don't know he's trying to warn us but it's because he's trying to self sacrifice or some stupid reason like that but I'm here to help him I need to help him I mean we're not gonna leave just because some apparition tells us to there's a slam as the tower shakes and you hear the roar of the dragon crashing against the walls and the wall of force is still in effect and you can hear it there the rattling and shaking against the the building of the estimate yang and like the guys we got about 10 minutes to get as far away from that thing as possible and I just yell up stop ruining me yeah if you thought me stepping on some of your old toys was bad there you've led us this far what do you want to do and there's underground passages from here correct there is a secret passage from the stewards tower to under beneath to keep yes I know we where we need to go to continue this mission I need a moment no we need to go now okay okay and I start to rush off toward something like follow me you descend deep into down the staircase to the cellars of the stewards tower there you see the collected bottles of wine where of your father's old collection and as you come down the stairs there's a pop as the corks pop out of the bottles of one of one of the bottles of wine and it pours out onto the floor and forms into a word and it says no no please don't you have to go you have to go there's nothing for you here I'm gone No nope I'm not leaving without him goggles still on do I see the same form in here um you again in Arcana check no that's a seven there's not you don't see an unseen servant but there is some magic force that is pulling the wine in this shape what are you what does your senses tell you Sebastian here I need oh it's alright it's alright it's the I mean don't know right now be at least 15 years old older well the pole is in the bottle yeah no no it knows it's all been kept well it's probably so it's actually probably pretty good it's probably worth more to sell than this is just it's not it's not magical wide the magic is causing the wine to come out the wine isn't that it's not magical you're drinking way too much I get hints of dragonhide you just have to say that there's complications flavours it's dragon wine sodium's a lot of solid you know drink business going look off time for drinking regardless of oh good if there's wine exploding everywhere what do you want me to do what I'll go to waste yeah and I yell out and I say stop trying to protect me I've been through enough situations I can handle this where are you and I wait make your persuasion check 15 this is intense one of the big casks and wine the tap pops open but no wine comes out [Music] I go up to it and I try to take the front yeah it's a massive cask I'll help a big barrel but not like and enough like one of those giant barrels you hold the front off of it open and there's a passage I knew it that's incredible guys come this way and I start to go to the passage I'll be back for this later just grab a bottle okay and I'm like rushing like to the point where I'm not even watching the guys behind me I'm assuming they're keeping up but I am I am heading towards my goal you run down the tunnel a wine cellar we have to tend to the darkness towards the keep of Castle Drakon and that is where we're going for tonight I imagine the veils running so far ahead of us that like we actually just lose sight of her she disappears into the dark you like to the point where I can like use my fila gel B and then I wait and then I use my feline agility and then I wait I can get so far ahead you run and then you stop for a second and just taking your surroundings and then running it there's a dragon outside guys I took care of it I took care of it I mean for ten minutes it will not get into the castle what's it gonna do I'm most scared no it's too big no don't worry stop don't worry
