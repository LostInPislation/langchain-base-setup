tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon hybrid cottom its rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome to castle Drakken ancient and imperial sitting atop the high spire cliff overlooking the city the keeper of Castle Drakon has been an unapproachable prize at the heart of the ruined city our heroes went last we left them have ventured deep into the bowels of this forsaken place flying over the walls and landing in the Stewart's Tower they have taken a secret passage from the outer walls deep into the heart of the keep traveling down this dark and winding passageway one veil that you remember from your childhood the very same passage that you would sneak through to sneak scraps from the kitchen for on the other side of this passage after travelling several hundred feet you emerge on the other side of a large wine cask in the wine cellar of Castle dragon my dad is obviously leading us not out of here but towards where he is oh you're oh you're not there okay I walk into the light get out of here it's great wine yeah it's been aging for over 15 years phenomenal probably got some magical properties to it you probably don't want to actually ingest that does that the wine actually aged though because doesn't all food stay like unspoiled whatever it is the wine is utterly delicious you you look looking over the labels of the bottles these are the kings reserved wines assembled from across the world some of the finest vineyards through caspia Illyria and lands beyond are assembled in this wine cellar you and this is on the this is not on the steward side this is on the castle drakken's each of them is filled with all the wine bottles presented at words with their labels like front faced perfectly and in the middle of the room is a large table with a deep red tablecloth set over it and a pair of chairs and several glasses and there is an empty bottle of wine knocked over on the table and sprawled Oh sprawled over on one of the chairs is a man who has just stabbed into his own wrists and is lying there dead like freshly dead I I go over and I start it's hard to tell in Drakon I'm but I start to try to examine the body to see like if there's any signs that he's been here for a while how much blood is on the ground there's blood dry in Drakon Jaime the body that's blood is wet and slick on the ground around him veo you uh you recognize this man this is the body of Josef 'n who was one of the royal wine tasters who was this maybe it was so good he had to kill himself one of the royal servants that used to taste the wine and essentially be responsible for this room but there was a job boosting our wine and you got did he get paid to do this probably you probably had a lot much schooling and tutelage in the area of wine I mean you want to study magic you're chosen why didn't want to say okay magical wine and I go up to him when I feel first pulse he is very dead there seems to be an opening as you go to feel for his pulse jingle the body and there's a jingling of keys oh I jungle him louder they jingle oh wow I searched and I grab keys guys that this is obviously something's going on here obviously people don't just bleed out for no reason it's blood is fresh on the opposite wall there is a single heavy door leading into here and you can see that one of the wine racks and several of barrels have been pushed up against the door and a bar has been set down across across it and the door appears to be be locked and parts of it buckle but it but it has been stuck closed so kind of barricaded from the inside I want to listen against the door I know that I mean being my favorite area of the castle obviously the kitchen is should be on this floor as well as a few other things but we're kind of in the the basement area of the castle and I would be really cautious about wandering too far where we can't know where an exit is due we go through the kitchen to get to the throne room our objective just so I'm clear is we need to find the throne room and make sure that we have a path to it and we need to know how to get there easily and safely well I mean so we're in the basement right now yeah there's five levels of the castle the throne room is on the fourth floor okay so we need to be able to get up there now there are staircases around that then that can lead us up there but I don't know how clear or how easy that journey is gonna be I'd take cautiously that I mean we saw minotaurs coming in they're probably not the only creatures here that would probably take us out on a fight if they found us I think yeah let's what do you think yeah it was barricaded for a reason in it but it's the only way out it's the way we have to go yeah I'd go up to the door and listen you could hear there are sounds coming from the other side give me a perception check twenty-one you hear the speaking of guttural voices speaking a language you don't understand and once in a while every few minutes you hear this strong sound of metal against wood and a wet meaty slap are they speaking under common listening at the door no they're not darn sounds like how did I learn that sounds like a butcher shop out there can you send your familiar through can you be invisible the answer to both of those is no if we practice the machine through the keyhole surely you want to be jammed through a keyhole oh god that's a no I heard if we if we open the door crack though I can send them out we have anymore gaseous form potions yeah yeah oh I feel like I feel like I want to save those for a special occasion okay they're great escape card yeah true and this is the only door in the I get far away we came from the way you came yes like we could either go back or go through okay guys just open it a crack I could send Crowell yet okay um yeah can we do so as quietly as possible I don't know how quiet this will be so I'm gonna door but gently take the the barrier off okay and and just just just enough that it's off of the like it's not stopping give me a dexterity check no three three so you lift it up and with a clatter you go to turn around and bang it against the door and they go whoops and then I bang it again Sebastian whoops you knock me into the door and there's a lot I know I drop it and I miss I I open the door a crack and I'm gonna actually quickly minor illusion as far as I can down the hall another thud and bang okay if I'm yet open you push the door open it opens inward okay or no it opens outward sorry I'm wrong so you open the door and looking down the hallway you see there's a hall with that opens up into a large room and as you open the doorway the smell of cooked meat assault your nostrils old familiar saying but you're not sure if it's work or why yeah it's hard to place it exactly I'm in I mean does it smell like when I cast wall a fire on a group of paladin's not dissimilar and as you look down the hallway you can see there is this massive minute or carrying a bloodied butcher's axe walking down the hallway slowly and methodically to towards the sound that was created and he as you look out the door he makes direct eye contact I I creep the door closed and I turn around slowly what did you see big guy there's been an incident and we need to hide everybody hide hide-and-seek everybody hi I take out my moveable rod and I click it behind the door no no there it opens out whoops wait I grab the rod and I put it down at foot level hoping the hill trip when it comes in and then what's around what's in this room what there's barrels barrels casks tons of bottles of priceless wine a corpse a table bowl of wine some utensils and the secret passage opens behind a barrel yes all right get the barrel barrel shuffle packing of a barrel and close it is there like a hole anywhere in the barrel yeah that you could look out of okay check great sixteen eleven six okay actually I don't want to go in the barrel the heavy steps come down the hallway and as all of you are trying to jam yourself in the barrel or decide whether or not the barrel you want to go in the barrel the door opens up and this hulking creature clad in mostly he's wearing this what looks like a cloth apron with a belt tied around and there's several heads dangling from the side and tools of butchery various butchers cleavers butchers knives all in the pockets around him and he's carrying the axe and he looks at you with his bovine face that is all scarred and burned up inside and he says something in the abyssal tongue and he howls out and rushes towards you for initiatives no as he rushes there's a immovable rod at ankle height just to remind you did he notice Ashton why pretty brutal really all right it's not great okay so the door is open what continuous ruff I'm still unsure I'm so unsure of whether I want to go in the barrel or not that is your barrier still up in theory yeah it's been about ten minutes right no it hasn't been 10 minutes maybe I say concentration if your plan involves the barrier I need to know right what do we got for initiative 9 what can I be the highest okay 5 I also have 9 do you want to go first the act shall go first okay I'll try to jam yourself into a barrel like did it get what is almost confusion yeah mixed with hunger as the the creature crashes into the room through the door past the table we've got the rod let's find out in the rod in rod we trust he does not trip over he steps right over it with a 17 on his desk sanity saving throw steps radar and he looks at the string yeast he looks at the stringy one you look to muscly he looked pretty good so he brings his great axe down over vale okay charging forward getting a twenty four two hits so this is a charge attack with his great with the the core okay so it is gonna be 11 piercing damage plus yeah so a grand total of 20 piercing damage and you need to make a strength saving throw huh 5 um he knocks you prone and you go crashing into the pile of barrels well yep just with this wide the basically coming into the room body checking you against the wall is almost checking you right out of the out of the barrel and into the the room itself and as he does so there's a thunder of more hooves as to other creatures come rushing down lately and burst into the room but that is the entirety of their actions and this one's gonna come rushing forward as well Pluto you're up he wasn't close enough for like a sentinel right yeah he would've triggered Sentinel if cuz he attacked Bay oh and you were rapist imma give him i'ma give him a big old hey Oh with ignatius getting a 20 you have advantage to attack him because he attacked rocket recklessly and it is a hit let's just check for a crit no okay thank you and his ignatius glowing with the cool golden glow yes ignatius now deals radiant damage instead of fire damage Oh baby Ignatius I love you but he and you might not talk back anymore yeah yeah okay it's 18 damage nice Ignatius flares to life and Cleese deeply into the side of this beefy beefy Minotaur and actually I want him to make no you know it's not even worth it and I'm just gonna start swinging at him nice Wow I'd like a 25 also a hit for eighteen damaged again so that's first attack oh and first two attacks or the first one was sent oh yeah Sentinel oh my god yeah eighteen that's also a hit oh this is max damage Oh baby eight did you check for crystal because you have advantage against him because he attacked recklessly not a crit um twelve twenty twenty-nine damage oh my god how do you do that thanks Tammy I got an eight two six two six nine and then I'm gonna hit him again yeah oh and check for crit no another twenty damage what happens you've just torn him apart um so he charges in and just rails down on veo and as his blade is down I'm gonna like catch him low bring up his blade cut him once in the chest and then just drive ignatius right up through his head I just finish I mean just four quick there's like this guttural splurge of blood and gore that vomits up from his mouth as you disembowel him from the final blow and the the corpse crumbles to the ground and then I run at the next one and I'm out of attacks but I'm gonna make him make a Janet didn't Oh boom 14 I actually only get a seven so I want to push him backwards does he hit the movable rod it is on the ground so sure he gets a natural 2000 he's so sturdy it's different one okay deal okay Val you're up what about smashed or no sorry I thought that I I thought the veil already went that was her getting I just get hit her doing a nice damage up on the barrels I take my bow out and I'm just like rude I'm a bit shaken but I take my my shots using my dread ambusher and I go for it oh no 10:10 two hits yep this guy rang and he is not attacked recklessly so there's no advantage there so it's a Miss I'm afraid okay second twenty three that's definitely gonna do it Rashad sails right past him basically Pluto knocks him out of the path of the shot yeah 22 did you get sneak attack on that yeah do it yep cuz yeah pardon me third shot 14 that is a hit 24 damage nice that leaves him bloodied yeah well done nice and I peppered with shots he stumbles backward and butts up against the wall almost tripping over the immovable rod but not so soon hang out on the barrels standing my ground cool Sebastian you're up Sebastian see here's the other minute we're coming down the hall sees the two in front of him and he starts looking around the room all the objects around him but then he he actually reaches into his pocket pulls out ten gold throws it on the ground and casts animate objects the animated objects go immediately after you okay yeah so yeah I throw the gold on the ground pull out the staff and animate objects on the gold and they just start firing like a machine gun at this Minotaur hey man payday I said Monti coming up with any sort of line or like prompting or natural Sebastian Crowe says it's payday okay so you make ten coin attacks how do you use the staff to cast it no no it's I think it's one that he knows everyone's disappointed that we didn't see a wild magic sir yeah I really wanted a plant guys it's it's coming like there's gonna be so many castings of that don't worry okay is alright what's I have a plus eight so I think all of these hit my lowest my lowest is a twenty okay so roll 44 plus sixteen and that's four four of them the first four there's ten of them total yeah yikes I love this spell you do it reminds me 44 + 8 r u+ each one is 1 d 4 + 4 damage okay so these flying coins just come out as if running out of a roll of coins 26 you don't want to value out of this girl don't need jokes one of them's one so that one okay and then I have 15 that's a hit alright and then the other two are higher than that so three of them okay [Music] twenty two more so the coins burst out towards this minute or like grapeshot and just they spin on their sides and fire through him like bullets I still have one more he's dead okay the last coin flies up this is the last coin deflects off and misses he gets the spirit change you've been spared oh yes there's all my puns you guys guys took all of the good puns and now I can't think of anything better to say I I call the animated coins back to me okay and I can still concentrate on the spell yet so that I move I'm gonna move back here yeah they effectively have a flying speed of 30 feet yeah so they're like hovering above my hand I'm just like returned investment yeah alright and that's that's my turn and this guy is just a sock mulch mulch by death by gold your deep pockets they're there when you're coming up with these puns I need I need one they wanted guys well I'm unperturbed by that the the remaining Minotaur sees what just occurred and it howls with bestial rage and races towards Pluto as another minute or bursts into the room and the two of them both bring their axes down upon the little attacking recklessly one getting a 21-2 hit hit and the other getting a 17-2 hit miss it charges at you Pluto and you take a grand total of 17 points of piercing damage make a strength saving throw [Music] 20:20 you stand your ground though as it tries to pitch you into the air and throat fling you towards Sebastian excuse you Minotaur man okay cool awesome next up we have our special guest star from the opening of the room comes around a corner comes around the corner a strange looking Minotaur his face is almost turned in like the face of a man and he has these big instead of the horns on his head he has these big tusks and he stands much more upright he wears this massive belt of bronze and he carries a crossbow made of brass in one hand and a sword in the and as he sheaths a sword he's got this kind of bandolier of various bolts and concoctions all around him and as he almost appears out of nowhere just not through the door not from around just appears and as he comes into the room he lowers the crossbow and takes a shot at he's got a clean shot on Sebastian oh I was gonna try to IQ that I was behind the barrels getting a 21-2 hit [Music] oh he accepts the error okay our bolt the crossbow is like a ballista shot coming in and it deals a total of sixteen piercing damage and then as it strikes into you it bursts in a spray of acid making a constitution saving throw [Music] good I got a 14 it's a failure yep so you take an additional twenty four points of acid damage and again you're not wearing your goggles you need to be wearing your goggles as it comes all the time it it hits me in the I don't know where does a ballista shot not kill a guy it hits me in the shoulder or maybe in like the thigh well I imagine that you'd go for a dive and it slides past you and hits you through the side and then as it does so it hits the wall behind you and this burst of acid just strikes you in the back oh that's one of your kidneys Alma kidney leader robes and as you look up at your attacker the the purple cloak that he wears almost comes to life and swirls around him and he disappears from view excuse me yeah constant concentration you need to make two oh yeah sweet concentration check number one I'm going to use a different dice this dice is upsetting slice and all dice 22 that's good yep 11 this the acid damage was 25 damage so the DC would be 12 the coins fall and I slowly pick them back up as I clear and I'm just there picking the coins back up bleep oh no you know you're up I'm just gonna keep swinging at new Minotaur that's they've been hitting me and stuff they both attacked recklessly yeah you okay Sebastian no I get like a 32 hit for 24 damage Oh No yeah and I'm gonna do that on the one that actually hit me cool that jerk a 23 to hit for a 22 damage and just keep swingin just keep swinging in okay advantage avoided a Miss a like a 27 to hit for this one's I was fun only 17 damage that is enough to clinch it so with a series of swipes I imagine that you disarmed him literally like both arms yes first arm goes off second arm goes off and then a stabbed in the neck and then I chest kick him off my off my sword and I'm gonna try to knock prone next dude Oh 12 athletics I get an 11 yeah so I knock him prone and I'm gonna stand over him nice stay out of your up [Music] so he's prone I'm still gonna take my two shots out of anyways so I get just regular because I would have advantage right yeah if you stand next to him because he's prone you can just shoot him in the face with advantage oh okay I'm gonna stand yeah yeah you should just shoot him in the face yeah [Music] 20 that's a hit gross because you're using your crossbow and you have crossbow experts so you don't provoke attacks and you don't suffer disadvantage I was using my longbow right but he okay in that case technically you wouldn't have had the advantage but I'll overlook at this time because I thought you were using your crossword okay okay just use your crossbow then just shoot him in the face oh yeah use my longer yeah 30 damage well that's a hit yeah it's nice [Music] twenty-one damn it cool so you run up right beside him pepper two arrows in his neck but he's still not down Sebastian over to you does he look mortally wounded yeah Crowley's gonna fly over and start packing at his eyes and then I'm going to fire Bolton and Crowley's helping me out so it's gonna be with advantage which cancels the disadvantage cuz he's prompt one five feet away so it's just a regular tag unless you run up and want to just if you're within 5 feet of them you it you know it wouldn't it would if you if you go right up to him you can have the advantage I'm gonna say they all cancel out that way I go right up to him and I'm going to with Crowley packing out his eyes I'm gonna fire Bolton with advantage yep elven accuracy okay that's gonna be oh wow I didn't I keep forgetting what my bonuses so that's gonna be a 25 to head that's a head and that's gonna be it's a three you got a nice 3d 10 fire bolt now BAM [Music] twenty-one damage leaves a searing hole where his face used to be and then after I burn his face out I'm going to quicken web in the doorway sounds good to me so you put a web down in the doorway I'll go grab my yeah I'm worried about that other guy coming back in here then we'll see him in slap him in the face should I not worry about the web maybe I shouldn't don't yeah nevermind I contemplate casting web but I don't see anybody in the doorway yeah we don't know worries so after I burned this guy cruelly flies back to me and I go and hide in my corner I go pick up my moveable rod okay the halls are silent you know you probably was going to tell more minute or so here right well then we just need to not be here let's be over there I believe and I point over there um I say let's quickly get to the next floor so upstairs right is where the is on the way to the throne room upstairs is where we need to go do I remember which side of the castle the throne room was on it is on the absolute opposite side from what way your honor okay yeah probably easiest way to go would be to get to the other side and then go straight up the way Castle drakon is laid out from what you remember is every level has a Great Hall a gallery that is connected by the the stair tower which is the Grand Tower that overlooks all of track and I'm where the Dragons are that Tower stair connects all the main levels except the basement because the basement level is accessible only by the servants stairway and then the another stairway the tower that goes right up beside the stair tower okay so we probably need to get up one of those other stairways and then make our way to the the bigger stairway throughout the building as well there are other staircases that lead up between other floors and there are other ways down and up and it doesn't discount the fact that there could be other damage there's also a lot of balconies and as as a child you knew that there were ways to get from you could climb up and outside the building across balconies and through windows to get around in the upper levels as well the lower levels are quite fortified but the upper levels have these more leeway this does yeah yeah I don't know how you do climbing but I mean I mean climbing I'm fine it's just being quiet when I do it I also just take some of my aunt Minh tand like rub it on my face I'm like I definitely forgot to dodge the head I am as I'm bleeding I'm looking at all my pockets and in my sleeve I find a patch for for healing potions and I pull it out and I drink all four oceans crack them all open at once you're gonna have to pee so bad wine and potions we don't have time for washroom breaks on this yeah you gotta hold it I'll just pee my pants don't worry guys I'm already soaked in soil alright with that mental image in mind which way would you like to go I want to take a quick look at the floor can I tell which way mystery acid shooter dude went Minotaur well looking out into the hallway there's actually only two directions that he could have gone because the hallway ends in a dead-end and it continues out into what you can only assume might be the the castle kitchen and there is a doorway that is shut on the opposite side of the hallway from you anybody hear a door open or closed I didn't you can still be here goggles I think he he I mean it looks like he teleported but it's hard to say where maybe he's invisible I don't know there are so many options with magic magic look okay but I say we hit the kitchen okay I turned on my goggles my unbiased opinion totally just a reminisce in the space that I once called home okay as you head down the hallway into the kitchen the large kitchen is almost like the furnace of the castle there are the three huge ovens and a large open spit where the castle used cirrhosis feats and feasts and tables and tables for preparation and storage shelves upon shelves of dishes and cutlery and all the supplies but this once once the heart and living soul of the of Castle Drakon has become a charnel-house for scattered across all of the preparation tables in the kitchen are piles of bodies which have been butchered and sliced up and there is a the spit that used to roast whole hogs has several human corpses impaled on it which have been slowly turning and now burning on one side do I recognize any of them most of these bodies are butchered beyond recognition looking through these bodies though quickly the vast majority of them do not appear you don't recognize anyone from the castle staff rather you're like oh that guy kind of looks like one of the Queen's men or that guy looks like I might have seen them in the hood like a hooded Lantern who disappeared weeks ago in fact piled in the of the corner in a large stash is a huge pile of equipment including several hooded lantern cloaks various these bandanas even bits of the paladin's armor and weapons it seems like the collection of victims have been brought here for eating I go up to the stash of stuff and kind of rummage through real quick and see if there's anything worse like quickly scavenging make a quick investigation check eleven there's a few good sets of mundane arrows and some decent armor like so sorry some decent arms in here but it looks like everything of value has been picked over even the where the gold is that these people might have been carrying or if they were having and healing potions they've been taken in somewhere else leading off the kitchen room itself is in our hallways leading both to the west and back to the east and at the North End of the kitchen there is a doorway which Aveo you remember leads to the servants stairwell with my goggles do I see any sign of big acid dude as you come into the room you can see hiding in the corner invisibly far over by the doorway there he is standing and visibly with his crate with his crossbow at the ready and as you end he's waiting patiently and as you come into the room he's all he almost he stealthily moves across almost like he's waiting for the perfect moment to strike I without without paying too much attention so I have my goggles on and I kind of catch him in my peripheral and I look I I kind of like continue to look at the two of you make a deception check we also have the elemental mental note we our mental note we are mentally linked ten okay you're trying really hard to make it look like you're not looking at him but you're looking at him okay you're looking so I like remake I like look at him and he looks at me and then I like look away and then I'm just like does anybody else smell pork chops at 11 o'clock John as you turn to speak he rushes back down the hallway towards the door and I rush after okay I will reroll initiative we can reroll initiative and then and then that's even matters 18 15 14 so the only thing is that what did you get Sebastian 15 so they order your order changes but he actually beat you all ah ah darn it darn it I don't even know what I'm looking for okay you tell us about as you move to strike he yeah yep as you moved to strike he bounds down the hallway towards the door and he turns around loads what appears to be this kind of like bolt bound with webbing of some kind into it and fires it at you Sebastian ah nuts getting a critical hit so that is going to be a total of yeah it's gonna be 33 points of piercing damage Oh the lotions [Music] on his ballista works as it straight strikes you this mass of sticky webbing explodes out from it towards veo and Pluto and you can all makes text arity saving throats yeah 20 and you too Sebastian 12:12 8 you were both restrained in the webbing veo is not but he backs around through the door and goes around the corner I like collapsed to the floor in this webbing and I'm just like staring at Julio also in the webbing I'm just like I'm bleeding so much was there a guy others is there a is there a minute sorry did you see him I've been shot with two ballistas in the last five minutes I don't feel so good he's out the door I like try to like tilt my head in the right direction for day I'm like he's that he's there did we see the door open yeah you see the door open and slam shot and he's in in the next hallway now hmm they'll pick me up and carry me on your back I'll be your eyes I don't know if I'm strong enough to do that what are you gonna do there I am going to take my last I can I'm like I can't see him but I'm just your instinct I'm gonna just go ahead hurt and I rushed through using my feline agility to go past forever kick open the door you bump into something right in front of you did you find him yes I take out now my crossbow okay and I gonna take some shots at him [Music] yep yeah make a dexterity save because you bumped right into him right so just make it Xterra t saving throw 22nd yeah you managed to keep your footing yep okay do I I've disadvantage because he's still invisible yes let's do this I believe I believe I believe 12 it is a miss worse also 12 fire three shots right in front of him and all three just go go completely wide you hear the swishing in the air and in front of you is it my turn it is your turn Sebastian alright you can see him but you're restrained in the web's I cast fairy fire how it's in my ring interest and requires only a verbal component so okay summon the magic from him like bow okay and I can see him and I just glare at him and I get to 9 on his saving from illuminated nice very nice Pluto it is your turn okay how do I get out of these webs oh yeah it should I try to get out of the webs uh you need to use an action okay no my action was well spent so I can use my action yep Oh what am i doing make a strength or dexterity check I wanna do strength 21 22 you smash open the restraints and can move normally now and I'm gonna rush at him okay and I'm gonna stand right beside him oh yeah I can only make it that far yeah yeah so I just keep him occupied okay we go to the top of the round it is the this monsters turn and he still invisible he lowers his crossbow you know you kind of feel like this crossbow pointing almost right at your head but she can see him though right because of a fairy fire oh yeah oh yeah that's that's correct she can see my mouth the eye so he lowers it down to fire Anatole yeah so he doesn't have the he doesn't have the invisibility anymore he fires the the the the crossbow almost at point-blank range at you and as he lowers it into it it almost burst forward with lightning yeah haha and he fires it out and you roll at the last second and the bolt shoots right down the hallway past Pluto and rape past Sebastian okay and so having having done that yes and now that he is fairy fired does he get a saving throw to get out of the fairy fire fairy fire any creature in the area when the spells cast is outlined in lights if it fails its next charity saving throw for the duration mm-hmm oh no yeah the you're you're locked into it aren't you yep and you can't okay so he can't use his bonus actually these things get to become invisible as a bonus action at will they're awesome that's why I packed very fun okay so he can't use this bonus action so he is going to move north towards the doorway and he just gets right up to the door yep decide an opportunity attack from there it is not because videos and holding a melee weapon it's true Klaus go for it you can scratch it cuz he's fairy fired 21 that hits that's great it's not great for one damage yeah guys we heard him we drew blood your cloth snaps off as you strike him because he's actually resisted two non magical damage so vo you're in underneath the Great Hall so you know that this hallway the way this hallways laid out with the with the castle stare it is like this on every level of Castle Drakon and right in front of you in this in this hallway is the castle cistern which is a great fountain where all the castles water comes in through fountain where there's three gargoyles that spit water into into the center there is a doorway leading up to the staircase that goes across the various levels but here is also the entrance to the castle Drakon crypts mm-hmm and it is a massive ayran door across from you and on flanked on either side of it are these massive constructs of stone and iron identical for the ones that were beneath the grand Cathedral Oh coming out also down this hallway are a pair of doors that lead to a pair of Guard barracks [Music] so I actually believe that was its turn so it is your turn bale advantage on all the attacks against him I pull out my longbow and I I'm gonna take some shots at his back I was at the rogue part of you 20 that's a hit BAM [Music] [Music] 27 damage so as he goes to rush up the stairs just this vicious shot strikes it in the back 22 hits also a hit BAM 19 damage nice cool I am going to actually use my cunning action to hide back in the door okay Sebastian you're up you are still restrained I'm gonna try to break out strength or dexterity either are ya 14 you push against the sticky webs and strands that bind you in place but you cannot break out oh darn nice a stuck hold on I just need to check if there's somatic components yeah you're just restrained you're you can still perform somatic and horrible components yeah lovely well I can't see him no and I can't move right nope um you know what yeah I got nothing let me hold on all right pollute over over to you I'm gonna run past Vail I don't think I can get to them though I kind of like sleek up against the wall and I'm like go for it I think I'm gonna I'm gonna - okay just get right up to him right on top of them nice I go hello you shot me with Webb that's gross and I'm gonna probably try to kill you in a second okay I say to the glowing thing all right the massive creature as you come up to him he reaches into the bandolier on his front side and pulls back this infernal looking dagger and he stabs it into your shoulder hey getting a 29-day I just see like the outline of a hand I'm like what's he doing drop he drops the crossbow takes the dagger out puts one hand on your shoulder takes the other just stabs it down into your chest you take 12 points of slashing damage and you need to make a constitution saving throw you know it's not the first time I've had something stabbed into my chest so this is pretty I get like an 8 okay you fail so wait can I do indomitable believe the man's gotta believe 25 okay you succeed I had to and instead of taking 30 poison damage you only take 15 oh my gosh you are also not poisoned by by the attack so he just stabs the dagger down into you oh yeah and then he is gonna be sure to pushes you off and he tries to make a break for it provoking an attack Oh Oh sir I crit okay so it's gonna be uh 41 damage and I want him to make us strength save he gets a 10 and he's gonna take another 8 damage okay and I'm gonna do a distracting strike okay oh sorry uh yeah distracting strike as he takes the damage he turns around to back to face you and he smiles this wicked grin with this weird like half human half bovine face and all of a sudden this giant boil appears on his chest and it's glowing and another one appears and another one appears and he takes the dagger and he stabs it into his gut and the boils continue to build up on his back tell with a horrible wrenching wet sound he explodes and veio need to make dexterity saving throws value of advantage because you're around the corner 26 is it him is it magic it is not oh nice it I get a 21 okay so you both succeed but you still both take 5 fire damage and 5 Thunder damage and 5 acid damage any dodge on this torture uh technically no because on candy God has to be an attack but you have the do not have an evasion yet as a rope you know no okay so yeah it's 15 damage total and he just explodes in this wet mass of flesh acid body parts bone and in the process the dagger goes flying out in shatters and the crossbow explodes - I'm gonna do the Captain America tuck behind the shield and just take it oh right because that reduces the damage to nothing fact yeah oh no but you have to use a reaction for that yeah which you use to make an opportunity attack when he ran no I he oh yeah I did you turn it you take that damage no I take it I take it all I try to do the Captain America thing but my legs are Todai I just imagine as this your sword is still in him as he smiles like this and you're like trying to pull it out as he just explodes right yeah you managed to roll away I'm like I couldn't land around the corner I'm like what's happening dead you yell from the other room no like I I get up you see a little cocoon Sebastian like slowly trying to hop towards you guys make a dexterity saving through can you hop no you know 9 you hop and fall over I fall like

to find out where we're gonna be with that the halls underneath the castle under castle dragon are quiet the kitchen fire continues to crackle and the slurping water of the gargoyles and the cistern down the hallway as they continue to spout the water out of their large open mouths Phil's are the only sounds that fill the air you have rested in the charnel house that is the kitchen now taking your short rest and what will you do next so we've a couple options here we can definitely go on try to go straight up to the throne room I don't know if there's anywhere else in the castle that you want to take a look at and maybe clear some of the stuff out before before we get there but I know my dad was leading us here for a reason so dad okay I haven't seen anything since we came in here I mean clearing out monsters has gone so well so far we kick somebody sometimes they just kill themselves they just blow up that's have to watch it I mean if the rest of them could do that that made the whole thing if I could stop getting shot yeah you gotta work on that I'll try so from the kitchen you know that there are there is a staircase leading directly up from the kitchen the servants staircase that leads to the upper levels Vale you know that this staircase should connect directly to the guest quarters as well as the Royal Apartments because this was the staircase that the servants used to bring food to the row of him as everything linked back to how food traveled throughout the castle people and food through spaces is the most important one of the most important architectural considerations when building any sort of thing if the food and people cannot flow the building is poorly designed and in fact the staircase here is quite well designed because as the staircase spirals upwards there's actually a winch so there's the there's a chimney in the middle where you can further yeah crank crank things up as well get in there I crawl in the dirt why should we do this the other way don't break it no I don't it is large enough the the dumbwaiter platform as you as you open the doorway it is large enough that a person could crouch down in it because it had to accommodate value you recall that there used to be serving tables on wheels that could go into the into it and be lifted up so that large platters could be taken all the way up to the banquet hall there may have been a few times where I hit on the bottom of these you know rollable bladders and maybe snuck a little bit of food you see like a cat's paw like come up with a grab like a like a biscuit now also leading off here is another set of stairs that at the end of the hallway at the end of the northeastern hallway what you know veio is you know castle dragon so well is that this is supposed to lead to an aboveground outbuilding and this is where the servants would come this is the servants entrance in the castle and finally there is well the great stair doesn't start till the next level up there's the cistern underneath and then there's a secondary staircase going beside it as well so there's kind of two sets of stairs that run parallel to each other going up and down the castle I mean to be honest we could take either way from here but it's whether we want to stop at the other floors that's really important I think I want to see where where my dad is leading us if he can lead us to him that is that was one of the most important things that I can do right now I agree I don't want you to miss out an opportunity to figure out what he's trying to tell us from a strategic standpoint I think if we either clear out most of the areas as we go just so there's no sudden surprises when we bring back Saul and George and Jupiter yeah and we can do that on the way out it doesn't have to be right now if if the trail picks up and we can follow him okay that's my suggestion I'm uh I'm here to follow you where this is your home and we're here to find your father so wherever you think is best I'm I'm in it for the long haul now from what I remember if we were to go up to the stairwell with the dumbwaiter would it lead across to the the grand staircase yes so there are hallways that lead back it's just that this staircase is gonna take you up if you take it up to the upper levels you're gonna have to either go through the gas chambers the Royal Apartments or or like most directly on the level of the throne room it would connect first to the ballroom and then if you take it all the way up it connects to the Royal Apartments and then the other side we'd be going through the throne room itself is accessible from both the top level and the fourth level because the throne room has a balcony level around it I say we go up try to get to the throne room see we see what it's like and then come back yeah and we can find like even just a random room clear it out and make that like our base of operations where we could know to come right away and then as close to the throne the throne room without being in it like we find a place so that when the eight of us come back that's like we know where to go you know we know how to get there and then we can group up and then go from there right to the I like that just something like safe as you say you saw certain things with your goggles before with my father I saw what looked like the same things that are in the amethyst Academy you know the servants that bring out the food it looked like one of them but like your father mm-hmm um do I remember if my father was had magical abilities no he did not have magical abilities if he did he would not have been able to serve as the steward okay he would have had access to magical resources from his station and rank and would have been able to use some of the magic items and other resources that are here but him himself being a spell caster having magic powers no no what right do you want to try to talk to him well if he's around then yes but like that's what I'm saying can you use your goggles to like potentially see what you saw before I can use them one more time before we have to [Music] okay then I say let's just go up the stairs and keep an eye out for any other signs he's pointing us in the right option ghost moves which set of stairs would you like to take up I see the ones by the minitor where we killed the Minotaur okay yeah are close to dawn are we how close to dawn it did we come here at night like in the evening I in the morning no we let we came here first thing in the morning well you met Lucretia Mathias this morning yeah and then you set out from there to the to the castle so I would say it's late in the afternoon okay so it's yeah I can't get charges back on my goggles for a while okay they need the Rising Sun mm-hmm okay we'll keep it for now just in case there's any more you know invisible visible jerks yeah okay so you head back out of the kitchen into the underground gallery the the this is a long chamber that is bereft with many statues and two massive stone protectors flanking a set of iron bound double doors the the symbol of the city is the royal family of Drakon Heim is emblazoned on these doors and what you can see is that both the stone defenders that are locked into the that are kind of almost built into the walls themselves they all have the crest of the vivan castles in the same shape and appearance as the badges that you now carry those are all one of those seals is also engraved with runes on each of the double doors coming off this chamber is a portcullis that leads into what looks like to be a small guard room and in the guard room are is a table with several weapon racks and four chairs on which are slumped the basically the empty armor of four guards of four royal knights and then further down the hallway is another set of doors and leading to the north is the staircase itself and then the base of the Grand Tower the Grand Tower stair which is a cistern where there are these three gargoyles that are spitting water in into them vo as you pass by these the gargoyles are not in the same positions they were when you first pass through this room creepy oh no guys these seemingly stone statues seem to have moved can we use our I mean it's not hurting anyone like maybe we can make them do stuff for us what do you want to make them do like maybe they have a guard don't try it on one yeah what's the worst that could happen the one closest to me okay an appointment ring at it they go I am I'm getting ready to fight no what am i the thing of the King I'm the one that holds the ring you're knocking it out of the park I'm really knocking it up making up my rhymes and a dude all the time that's a baseball-reference Pluto in the name of the king in the name of the king I I wrote it down I think what does he flew it was like pull in the name of the king the castellon okay I the Castellon command-v okay I Pluto Jackson it turns around it fails at saving throw and it says boy can't you see I got a job to do I'm an essential part of the plumbing yeah yeah yeah you guys were moving around like you guys were walking like it's talk and it's really hard to stand in the same position for all day every hour of every day right sometimes you got to let it come out this end sometimes you gotta let it come up that end you know what I mean have they always been able to talk did I know that there were playful names for them but if they ever talked no no okay I always kind of suspect that they are a bit like mmm cheeky ever everyone used to say that they had a cheeky character yeah and and in fact they were were usually named nicknamed cheeky rump and butts and who do I have command over he cheeky nice do you know their names do you tell us their names but but yey-hey butts guess who I am and I take my decanter of endless water pretending to be a gargoyle any did I find it amusing hey adequate water filtration for a castle fortification of this size is a significant issue don't make light of our jobs you do such such good jobs in the castle question for you guys have you seen anything weird other than minotaurs around here any dad's around yeah like my dad do you remember my dad ghost dad never goes dead just I need a member me do you know me how about my dad but a lot of cats come through the castle in past years but not from such a long time wait past years all years ago 15 years ago there used to be a little cat that used to run around all day all the halls on her hind legs picture that cut but like 15 years bigger my word but I remember you you used to keep well away from all of us scared of the water where you ha ha ha ha it's not my favorite thing um I definitely don't remember you guys talking that's for sure it's freaking me out a little bit I like it cheeky you remember my dad the Stewart all these the Stewart yes yes indeed indeed have you seen him lately hmm seen him no heard him yes speaks to us all the time he does feel him in the stones all around it was while ago that it was like he was calling out to us but then they point down to their feet which are not animated the tops half of them what you've seen now is that their feet are in locked in position so they're still stuck to their pedestals but the top parts of them can move around and change positions some Ally he's gonna make you've heard him through the stone lots of things been changing even some of the floors around all shifting around over the years they say some of the other statues you know we we we all got to talk in and saying you know things have been quite strange around here new inhabitants of course kind but we all keep to ourselves though the new tenants you know Stewart says to keep out of the way you hear him in the floors and in the walls yes I drop down to the floor and cup my mouth and I just go Bao's dad is this you rob mr. Senya these two were asleep but he came past this way in a whole bunch off running on the way down through them doors over there what the big doors the flanked by the - you ain't never come back what we have to go this is when you saw him alive not there not through the florist this was 15 years ago he was running he looked like he was hurt real bad had some strange glow to him too as he came down and he ran through them doors they shut right behind him see course he knew all the words what the words to go through the door hurts what are the words to go through the door repeat them please if I knew him I would be telling you he knew him we didn't what did you hear him like can you give us like a clue like did you hear him go or or like what was there a sound was there was it a murder blah yeah it's really what we're asking yeah I could go many places from there but he said his name and he said in the name of the king and then he said lunch over there were other words in a language I don't understand I run over to the door I run with you and I say and I am like I my voice raises and I say in the name of the king I the Lord Commander of a Sanya command you open okay the doors rattle and the force of the door begins to open but the you you can only target one of the doors I stand on the other side and I say in the name of the king I Sebastian Crowe the court wizard yeah command you and I point the staff towards the door open the other door the two doors burst open with a screech and there is a straight hallway extending back to the edge of the castle before before you and as you do so the the gargoyles cackle they say you got all the right words for the doors but you better bind the door men as excuse you the two constructs step out from the walls Pluto I point my ring at one of the constructs I see the car hi Pluto Jackson Castellon of the eye he already passed it then you got a natural twenty he's just walking closer like I did cat I'm a castle guy I'm the dude that oh not working how did my father do all of this at once doesn't make any sense we've telepathy with I'm more concerned about the Giants that she's walking towards us are they like is it yeah you better a real friend but we saw tell that the bond to to the wrestle oh they actually pop out that's horrifying that's scary I didn't know they actually popped out oh yeah that's so scary oh there's oh there's one here by the like close in is that one this is great hello hey how did that guy get right up to them this is uh interesting nothing goes exactly according to plan at least it's not a Bastila my thought is do we want to kill them okay what do we got we just run 17 17 I got 16 I also got 17 you wanna go first you want me to go first I can try to get you advantage yeah you go first Bam Bam Bam okay so that one of the golems got an 18 and the other got a 2 so to beat somebody okay so what was it again bail 17 Sebastian 16 and input it was before me I was also 17 all right as the massive constructs of stone pull themselves off the walls and raised their fists to strike the first one steps off the wall and steps down towards veo they owe and it and as it does so it puts its hands down on the ground and the this wave of energy resonates out from the stone Dale and Sebastian make wisdom saving crows no not wisdom 1914-15 you fail value succeed Sebastian you can't use reactions your speed is halved can't make more than one attack on your turn you can either take an action or a bonus action but not both you can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns ending the effect on a success cool Pluto it is your turn I'm gonna point the ring again at the one that has enacted yet okay.i Pluto Jackson I'm gonna try to get it right castellon of Drac and I'm command you it it only gets a 10 so if it is bound to you and I command it to go wrestle the other one this is all classic statue wrestling it's a classic statue wrestling Baio what are you gonna do I move my way inside the door using my bonus action to use my counting action to disengage okay uh and I say guys get in here so we can close the doors because we can control them and I take out my law and I shoot at the one that was had his hands on the ground twice wha-wha-wha wha-wha-wha thank you that is a hit nice 18 damage nice and this is using your longbow yep correct great second shot is nine to flex off the stone work 16 also to flex off its own and I back up a little bit more and I just say guys come on get in the doors okay Sebastian as these two statues are about to clash into each other I pull out the staff power and I pointed at the one that isn't in our control okay and I'm going to cast ray oven feeble mitt from the staff of power okay it makes strong things weaker oh now he'll definitely lose the wrestling match hmm exactly that's kind of the point okay the interesting play role of wild magic surge it fails the saving throw nice I'm so I roll oh you make it yeah yeah yeah you making it a spell attack that dice is gone it's never coming back it's too late for it I always forget the Raven Fieldman it was an attack role but it does makes saving throws yeah oh cool I got a 25 that is a hit it is enfeebled no that's my that's my wild magic Oh your wild magic surge okay again it's you're gonna roll twice dude Hey Ya Ya why am i rolling toys because you're in castle tracking yep 34 okay 34 or 25 it's good i crit i don't know if i can create with ravens okay an eyeball appears on your forehead for the next minute have advantage on wisdom saving throw checks that rely on sight this eyeball opens up and it actually appears on like a long stock monocle to go with your goggles can I like move it down oh [Music] no your own face are you staying like that alrighty so that's Sebastian so the Golem that yep so the dominated golem charges the other one and they try to wrestle each other to the ground and they do so it's holding the other down as as you go through the doors and the other tries to wrestle back and because it's in feeble that can't is remains in feeble and I and I get a - those are doors do you we are in our turn Mikey yeah can like can we pull the doors closed it's van Sebastian okay well we yeah close the doors okay command them closed I I'm like command closed and you're like closing oh yeah and I point the staff and it closes okay what's that uh what's that on your head put that thing away yeah tuck that away I don't know what it's just part of me now okay just accept it thank you mm-hmm I'm sorry this is magic this is how magic works no this is magic you're in a law [Applause] dust-filled hallway it looks like none has been passed this way in an age on the north side of the hallway are two bound doors covered in arcane rooms and the seals of the Von castles and to the south is another set of double doors also similarily bound and engraved with an archway covered in angels weeping at the end of the hallway is a torres is a lit torch sconce born up but by a statue of a cloaked figure that holds this this the torch out in one hand with an oar in the other is it sticks there's a big like sticks it kind of remind you of that Oh with my third eye I can tell that nobody's been through here in some time I mean I can tell that with my regular eyes by the dust I can see him looking down at the MARTA the the the stone of the floor is marbled and it almost the stonework is there's streaks in the stonework almost as if the stone was one spotty and someone brought their hands through it as if grasping or raking across the stone but it's solidified like this and there are stone like vines reaching up the well vines made of stone they look like solid strands of stone that are reaching up under the doorway the double doorways and out through the cracks of them all along this hallway and then embedding themselves in the stonework I hope you give me a few minutes I can try to detect some magical I have a also a plan okay go for it I reach into my fuzzy bag and I I pull out a fuzzy ball and I throw it down the hallway okay let's see what you get boo I get a giant weasel all right the big old weasel comes on out and his name is Weasley Snipes Thank You Kyle so Weasley Snipes and I'm gonna get him to start sniffing around okay if he begins sniffing around we all sit there watching you drinking more wine I'm it's a yep yes okay Sebastian you need some help we just take it easy big guy but we're at work right now every pop corn every time the the weasel is sniffing around okay that was my whole plan I don't know about you guys are we waiting for it to like detects a man no well he's in the wild sniffing all right why don't you try to just check some magic all three of my eyes go black yeah their eye falls off as you complete the ritual yes like a flop and I'm just like what was that and then and then I opened my eyes to try to see if there's any magical auras there are there are powerful auras of adjuration magic rating radiating from every doorway these doorways are magical but the vines on the floor and the walls don't seem to be well um I assume that while these doors like this is the one I know is the Crypt and the vaults right where would your dad likely go because I'm starting to think that if he was in a panic and he was willing to risk his life to get through these doors he was trying to protect something he was kind of abandoning abandoning his own sort of like well-being what what could be down here what do you hear the golems fighting each other I I don't like the crypts are the the vault I assume are closed yes the the two door the great dolls doors to the vaults are both closed as are the doors to the crypts you've never been this way I'm gonna take a guess and say the big double doors but that's entirely based on just intuition and guessing if they're not locked and we see that the stone vines are coming from these big doors correct yes I have a feeling that indication if he somehow had gotten affected by delirium ah if there's any sign of magic it might be the way to go but I don't see him getting into the vaults for any specific reason maybe I'm wrong though I mean if you were trying to hide the vaults might be the most protected place my father was returned to hide from anything if he ran this way where else do you think he was going in a panic looking wounded see I think he was trying to do a last ditch effort Vale I might be you know projecting but my father is always about her heroism so I assume yours is too and my father builds armor I remember I'm not good at this what did a long time ago when we were at the garden did we not hear something about my father protecting the children I'm trying to think back well that was that was days ago that was at least a week and a half ago my memory's not that great um days are kind of blurring together he would always try to do what's best for Drakon hime that's what my father did so what his whole life was so if it meant protecting them I mean if we can get through these big double doors rather than having to unlock these and I think that's a wiser choice for now are there any more giant statues on the sides of these doors no the the eyeball has taken root in the stone and is turning to stone but then the eyeball itself is like a piece of marble and it's and like a stone flower with a marble eyeball it's looking back up at you uh hold on now you try to be really hard to see through the eyeball you're looking back at it it's what used to be your extra eyeball it's just on the ground and it's it's it's me it looks like it's turned to stone but it is still moving in mobile like it's a flower made out of stone with an eyeball for plant because it was part of me to help me try to match Amador's Gerald gerald the third eye i'm i'm with you i could use telekinesis the one of the vines opens up with almost like flowers opening up but their eyes made of various precious stones and they just watch I think we need to go through these doors I'm uncomfortable I'm like backing up or you guys doors I'm I'm further away but I want to use my mage hand and I start to mage hand towards the door to climb it as they're working on the door I'm super observant to the hallway I'm just like backing up towards them comrades we need to use our rings we have to trust that the seals these are the keys to get in here if we don't show them we could be considered intruders does not include me should I watch an axe and or solo three of us my ring and I say to the hallway I am Pluto Jackson Castellon of Drakon Heim and I wish you to open the statue at the end of the hallway starts walking towards you hello I'm Pluto Jackson you might have heard me just say that I'm the castellón I'm Jack and I'm it walks right up to you as I talk to him talk to it hello and it turns towards the doors it places its hand on the doors and pushes the door open beyond is a room with a singular altar in its midst and covered in all around the sides in earns each labeled the vines of stone stretch across the floor from Ace arched doorway on the opposite side of this room that leads into stairs that lead down into the darkness below the vines reach up from the stairs all around and as you come into this room the flowers on them open up revealing gem-like eyeballs that look that regard you the rest of this room is only only contains the urns of the lesser von castles and the altar in the middle which contains stone slabs with the names of those who are interred here as I walk into the room I flip a gold piece to the doorman and I thank him and I'm gonna try something it's gonna be weird I I kind of kneel down to one of the gem like eyeballs if this is veo Sonya's father blink once when I stare at the eyeball a moment passes and it blinks guys need to go down there now if you want us to go down those stairs blink twice it does not blink now I'm wondering if it just blinked because major good or it could be my dad and we're leaving him down there to die if we don't rescue him really really quickly why would it why would a stone eyeball need to blink magic delirium no freaking City that's the point though it wouldn't have to blink because it's not a real eyeball it's a stone eyeball so the blink has to be communication oh oh do you understand us blink twice it blinks twice okay it's an it knows it can go my dad no you don't if you if you don't want us to go down here blink twice it blinks twice we're going down we have to go down going down dad start running towards the door as she like goes through the door I'm just like did we have to follow that's our guide I this is the last time I left my guy to hook it died from rats so I have to follow her I'm going the eyeball set and then you like I'm gone I'm gone being like you hear my voice I'm like catch up I turned to the stone man who opened the door and I'm just like stangard thank you and I run into the darkness as well the waves run down the stairs into the darkness one clunk clunk one I don't care what happens I'm finding my dad are you like like flee like running way like we're trying to keep up you and I'm calling after as you rush oh yes but I also want to make sure I'm not too far ahead so every once in a while be come on guys and I'll keep running okay as you rush down the stairs this bad you the streaks of stone vines begin to intermingle with ones with fleshy cables and biological eyes and as they intermingle with each other it is almost what you can see is that the ones of stone have coiled around the fleshy ones and choked them off and they've atrophied but in other places the ones of flesh are star trying to pry off the stone and pull it down I'm starting to develop a theory and I don't think you're gonna like it they out I don't want to hear it I need to find my dad we need to go I think we found your dad no no there let's just I keep running be prepared and oh you're gonna just like no you come down go to the stairs and the chamber opens up into a massive pillared hall that stretches across the entire foundations of castle dragon it is a massive chamber of pillars about 40 feet high and ten feet thick interspersed amongst each space about 20 feet apart each of the pillars a grave marker for a former king or queen of dragon hein all of the pillars are engraved with statues marking the deeds of the kings of Dragon hime whether good or ill and as you come down the stone figures rise for some of them have turned to flesh and there is a low dull moaning as the various forms of the Kings play out the images from their lives filling this hall with a low murmur of well a cacophony of murmurs rages despair and otherwise stretching down the hall stretching all down and around the hallways are and jutting out through the walls are large shards of delirium leaking with the liquid from up above which fills as you come to the base of the stairs the entire hallway the whole floor is filled to about the knee in this liquid so I put on my arms and I stopped at the bay as you come to the base of the stairs and you can see out into all this room and you can see fluttering between the pillars is this is this floating light this floating purple this of this floating light oscillating in all the colors of magic it's almost like this orb like figure it's floating or kind of dancing in and amongst the pillars if we use our seals maybe we can calm the murmurs and get a better understanding of what's happening down here yeah but they're they're not constructs but it's part of this the foundation of dragonhide these things are flesh though some are flesh summer stone like maybe we can maybe just even using the power of the seals we can maybe hush or settle some of the activity you guys you guys remember when we were going to see Lucretia Mathias for the first time and we went into the deep haze and there were just floating body parts and things changing into flesh glass and yeah does this remind me what's that yeah but in fact the whole hallway is suffused with the deep haze and you breathe it in deeply I think you guys are still under the effects of oh no because you took a short rest ah oh yeah there's probably some vomiting Simon yeah oh yeah do we have any more I'm I think I'm out I have three potions of aqua expert you or experiment we could use them now but then that means we have to leave the castle the way we came in which is by air then we leave by air yeah it's not like there's a dragon waiting up there for us okay I hand out the two vials to you guys bottoms up there goes all three you can teleport out of here - yes we're enough away from one dragon but it's either we find my father now or you'll find my father now we're here to find our dad I want to call out to this purple glowy thing I stand before you castellon of Dragon hi my name is Pluto Jackson and I wish you peace in the afterworld the floating light is this as it comes down the hallways it's massive it's a sphere a corona of delirium light and as it comes closer and down the central path of pillars the creature before you is this writhing mass of kingly heads all bearing crowns and all of them are like merged into each other and it's like this form of stone but mostly flash boiling over and [Music] out from each comes these long ten long stalks upon which is a head bearing a crown where one of the eyes of each head has bulged out into gargantuan size almost and the rest of the head kind of just dangles down and the other eye has fallen out of the sockets and in the middle of this or above heads as it comes forward a jaw opens up and it's a jaw of shards of delirium and bits of crowns and bone and a central eye opens up massive and wide shot through with purple delirium energy and as it looks at you you feel all the magic drain from your spark presence it screams what do you do I think we should have listened to your dad I've never done that in my life and I won't start now you only have a moment to decide what are you going to do let's focus ring focus fire this is a construct of the castle it's got some things I start to rain Godric doesn't answer alright it's okay reaches the light of Ignatius is suppressed all magic is drained and powerless as ice guys we need to I'm useless we need to back up so Sebastian we need to protect you we should just I feel badly my dad screeches again yeah and it closes its main eye and you feel the magic bristle as these long stalks shut forward and energies of purple green octarine blue begin to gather in this in the large bold eyes we're just gonna run so I'm gonna just grab Sebastian yeah and as you turn run each of you can roll the d-10 oh four seven four okay two fours and a seven those of you that rolled fours make dexterity say all of you make a make dexterity and Sebastian you make a wisdom saving throw No 23 16 15 you fail 19 you succeed as Sebastian turns to run oh you're a half-elf are you our high fells immune to sleep you can't put me to sleep oh you got hit with the sleep fray it can't put you to sleep I lose II I'm fine I'm fine drunk from the wine he just wants to keep partying um I I'm I'm determined to see my father but I say we know where we need to come let's get off the stairs and I'm angry about it but what if this is your father this is not my father Oh your mother her dad I don't wanna hear the answer blame God nine times if you're I might I've turned my back already I'm like no it's not my father and I run up the stairs I know I'm not following her this is right after I I like I like start to try to talk to it but that I see that they're running and I just turn and I start running okay well you flee back up the stairs I go to one of the eyeballs and I say was that you you have to say how many blinks you want it's really important if that was you one blink was that you one blink for yes or one wait for yes sorry I'm like incoherently she's yelling at this eyeball like one blink for yes two for no it twice okay good good good good good where are you oh you can't sir okay I'm like yeah you see you take a break if we kill that thing will it help you it links once for yes let's go murder that thing okay we need to prepare better this time we're not gonna go down okay okay okay we need to save your father I'm like shaking I'm like let's go Gilda we can kill it I know we can kill it let's go kill it yeah what are you best at shooting things meeting before you met us you were able to survive in this city by being sneaky yes I really want to get the drop on this thing yes because if it sees us it's a problem this time we can't run down the stairs screaming we want to be sneaky do you want me to pass that trace do you guys want to be sneaky do I'm gonna go to bed and be invisible I usually that's easier for everyone I can just wait I'll wait in the corner with the eyes but magic doesn't work run are you on the stairs who you run back up to the first place I ran back up to okay the first time okay Oh its second eyes oh um we could bring a friend what you can bring one of the the protectors actually would the magic just how did you feel when you'd open the doors that you but ignatius turned off I never really see him turn off any more magic doesn't work around it I felt is that what a normal person feels like God how do you you weren or me I hold a magic I don't know you're talking about one of us one of me just like me is that why you like work out so much to try to make yourself feel slightly powerful hey watch it now hey man that was gross could we guys could we oh no that's magic if it goes further away could be teleport past it isn't okay why don't we distract it so it's a bear in mind that at the starting at the base of the stairs in that entire level about 18 inches of the delirium sludge it covers the entire floor can you can we walk on water can you do otherworldly divine tricks don't give me the wave of the hands I have one vial of black goo what if we mix it mix it up a bit I have your the goo at it I have one vial of black goo I mean plan B plan a I can't make it I can we can have one potion that will let me breathe underwater I mean this might be the perfect time to use it you swim past what if we distract it awkward delirium no not awkward delirium sorry okay we are three powerful heroes okay or dragonforce what if we make a triangle around the being so it can only look at one of us at a time you might be on to something I mean I know I'm on to something I'm goddamn a blue Jackson either batteries on something you're the greatest monster slayer in the world I am have you ever seen a monster like this no but I've never met a monster haven't killed yet either so it's just waiting to die downstairs I mean you didn't kill the Lord of the feast directly I feel the executioner's all right mystical narrator Jackson lately and I'm ready to murder something guys can we ask Eldrick if he's seen anything like this before maybe he knows if some sort of weakness of this thing Eldrick I just want to go kill him yes have you ever seen an amalgamation of many kings turned into a giant orb of light with ten heads like eyes and a giant eye in the middle and sharp delirium teeth that reduces all magic in the area what it looks at you that sounds like an abomination I have never seen or heard of anything like that on this earth any tips for killing one well I'll tell you how to kill it when it's dead come on our music magic when it looks at us you mean like the magic just goes out don't well I'm fresh out of ideas alright thanks guys were on our own on this one I say we do what we do best that creature oh yes look you do know where it came from what it is what manner of Beast it is I'm working on theories here but it might be all of the kings of Dragon home merged into one thing with lots of ten things coming out of its head with one giant eyeball aberration of beasts and abomination something beyond our world entirely it is terrifying to behold or is there anything that used to live in the catacombs or that know nothing of the catacombs is Castle dragon who else do we have on line no guys we're not getting anything this is this is a one-of-a-kind monstrosity yeah but delirium turns things from things it's the corpses in the crypts turned into this look the more we're talking about it the less were killing it that we could use to kill it to talk about it after I really just I want those plans let me split up we split up and you only look at one of us at a time it's gonna suck are we gonna go into the delirium goop oh that's a good question what if we lure it can you turn into a giant eagle wait if he makes me aunty magic and the Delirium goop maybe makes me more magic maybe I'll just explode I don't I have no idea what's going to happen I got the math on that and yeah I it what what about the staff of power can it do any hilarious I still say we you know with the Rings don't do anything other than the goop on the ground is there anywhere like climbing wise on the side oh yeah there's all the pillars which are kind of writhing inanimate ah so they're gonna squirm when we touch them probably right they're ticklish yeah they're just ticklish Pilar's okay this is normal I was a bounty hunter for years I got sent on crazy missions to kill rogue mages and you know what I did every single time killed the mages yeah and I was just winged it the entire time I said I had a plan and I would always just go in and kind of just figure it out as it went along its what I'm best at I always almost died all right but but I didn't make it but we have to have if we're gonna go in and wing it we need in there we just need to know when to get out is well any windows down there no it's underneath we're in the basement this is this place is not at the fire code okay yeah there's not a proper exit so I guess our escape plan is we run yeah teleportation I like the idea of sneaking past it we can we can try sneaking up to it I can nuking it oh no I mean if we could sink past or though it does what if we blow up the bomb and the underside of the guy what does we blow up my dad let's not blow up anything down there place that's Plan C first you throw the goo if that doesn't work then we blow the bomb cool no yes you played a no to plan B shooter with my arrows can't be that hard to kill why would we're only going down there because your dad told us not to go down there yeah we're just ignoring the eyeball just said if we kill it it will help him yes we need to help him okay we have to help them okay hold on eyeball dad eyeball fail mr. sin yeah history name his real name is Johan Eisner mr. Eisner captain Eisner oh I know Eisner sorry so rude to my dad right now going mr. Eisner do you know how we can kill this thing blink once for yes twice for no it blinks twice do you have can you see down there it blinks once for yes are there any good vantage points for us to take to get the drop on it it blinks once free yes after waiting a while if I go in that purple goop is it bad it blinks once for yes we district the aqua expert Oh maybe that'll help I need anything else we can only add ask yes or no question you can be a giant eagle can you fly I'm not as strong is there any delirium in the room in the room that you are currently you doubts there is not any in the room you're currently in but there are shards of delirium jetting through the walls down there down there because Danny but I don't want to pull anything up with the chance of hurting my dad I go right dad and say if I blow up the Delirium will you be hurt he oblique three times four I don't know he winks three times yeah okay no we can't take that chance you have to do something not blow my dad no does I mean that we just have to fight this thing okay when we went down there were there like things like rocks and stuff that we could hop we're not there's pillars jutting up out out with all the statues and writing body because let's think you can take yeah like if I climbed up in lausanne office we've all walls is there anything there oh yeah like the all of the surfaces down there are carved in carvings or the Delirium like the all the walls are eminently Klima below from what you from what you saw it's just that they're eminently quiet Klima Bowl and also extraordinarily dangerous guys why don't I take my potion of invisibility I go down I scout it out I can telepathically let you know what I see okay as long as that thing doesn't see me yeah as long as doesn't look at you I think we'll be fine okay I'm also thinking maybe you can distract it with some like sounds or what if we got it to lure it I have an idea to distract it I have the deck of illusions I don't know what you're gonna pull out of it but if you need to distract it throw one of these cards giant weasel you listen you listen to beoh now veo master how about a Oh master you keep the deck and you do an illusion if it sees me because if it's seeing me you want me to come with you then it's not yeah come to the bottom of the stairs but like okay all right um what I'm thinking is like if you can do even like a minor illusion somewhere else along the cavern yeah I might be something to scare it I'm with you okay Pluto are you gonna come down and watch I will or you like maybe halfway up the stairs yeah it's like be within eyesight but as far back as possible I mean I can just wait telepathic bond I mean I if are we sneaking around yes this is a uh we're trying to gather intel on on the on the battle room as we recall wait oh wait that's all the stairs okay I'm gonna take this potion of invisibility and I know Iggy sneak I'm going to cast I think in my ring oh wait actually before I'm gonna cast greater invisibility on myself J greater invisibility only lasts one minute okay I'm gonna wait okay I'm gonna cast before I take my potion pass without trace okay so Lisa gives us a little more sneaky quietness and then I take my potion of lose ability okay and I grab Sebastian's hand so he knows where I am and I say let's go okay let me start to salute oh where are you going I'm gonna wait at the top of the stairs okay so I can see the landing okay these stairs go down a few times so there's there's several landings and they go down a hallway and then it comes out so I'm gonna stand at the back enough that I can see Sebastian if he's standing like on the moving platform before the goo okay I'm down a part of them so as soon as you come down that far so there's one last landing before the stairs come down and then there's like landing landing then goo yeah by that point the fleshy tendrils have begun and as you comment down to that point the eyes the the fleshy tendrils sprout eyes that watch but they watch Sebastian Val you can tell they can't see I noticed this and I'm like we're gonna have one minute we're gonna have one minute okay okay yeah if you need to go back up go back up I can always scream for help get in my head I can lead I can at least get down there cast minor illusion get it to look away I'm doing this telepathically yeah and give you a chance to scam okay yep I cast greater invisibility on myself okay all right I start to go down and I start to on the entrance of the cavern I first peek around to see if I can see that's loading or B bulb yeah it's gone back up into the higher parts of the pillars the room itself down here is about 50 feet high okay you're not gonna have passed that trace as soon as I leave so keep that in mind don't move I start to climb across the walls and you have a climb speed ID yep so the walls all around the outside are in many places the rock has burst through but these corded tendrils of either flesh or stone or even the shards of delirium and the rough walls mean that the walls are quite climb about and with your climb speed you have no problem climbing across them at times some of the hands of the statues like there are statues in here of Kings and on the outer walls they're not the Kings they're the kings family members or others that were treasured to to them but some of them the statues themselves have turned into flesh partway through and some of them the stone doesn't animate and some of it it does there's like even patches of flesh that just have been exposed as you come across climb across one your hand causes the chest of one of the statues to crumble away and there's a beating heart underneath it meat apple from who from the doorway can I see so I'm looking at the tops of the pillars are there any that look like they're not fleshy gross grab you spots like anywhere that I could stand there's several spots that you could probably perch and not have to worry too much about falling if you were perched there as long as something didn't hit you or impact you in some way but you'd have to you'd still have to climb up to them okay all right and you'd have to climb up and because the pillars are about 15 feet apart from each other you'd have to climb up the wall push off and leap across how far away they're the pillars are 15 feet apart from each other I might be able to get to an inch point Pete apart from the wall but if I try there's a chance of wild magic I can my staff can cast levitate and I could propel myself towards a vantage point and then we could get Pluto down here and try to get the drug sorry can you don't levitate something I just this is this a fight only objects oh is this a good fight this is gonna be are we are we doing this I'm still scouting out to see but I just want to see if there's anything like as I go in other than getting a vantage point on this thing is there any other corridors or caverns or ways that I can go towards where I might consider my father to be so you're climbing around and you're invisible mm-hmm okay so you've come out from the from the doorway and this pillared Hall encompasses the entire underground so looking around you can see there's there's fleshy forms and bodies all over these these pillars but at the center of the room on the north side where the tower stair is is one great pillar as you look around that is unlike all the others for it is a pillar you can see from it it is a pillar of solid stone solid stone yes it is the only pillar in this entire room that does not appear like you you can only like you look through it and you a real percent perception for you but as you look look around you can see through the light around it it is one pillar where all the statues there there actually aren't statues on it it is a naked pillar that looks like it might be covered in some kind of writing from this distance and it is the pillar that literally it would be the pillar holding up the tower stare and is made of solid stone do I see coming from the pillar anything like those stone tendrils the the tendrils of stone are reach are as you look at the top of it and the bottom of it there are tendrils of stone and the the sludge is watching up against the bottom of it and several these the tendrils of flesh are trying to encroach upon it but they they cannot there seems to be there's the surface of the pillar is somewhat rough and almost all be in some way it's difficult to tell from this distance because you don't have perfect a perfect line of sight to it from with the other pillars you'd have to get much closer to it though yeah you can try guys there's one of these things is not like the others one of these things just doesn't belong yeah I'm gonna try to get closer to it be careful to see what's going on but it looks like these stone tendrils are keeping this fleshy weirdness away is is the giant orb monster it's just floating around but is it like near that pillar it just seems to be bobbing around through the pillars mone the the low moaning is still going on here this this whole room and it just kind of drones all I've got your back if you if it if it notices you I'm going to cause a distraction don't worry I try to get closer to the storm how are you going to go a crop are you gonna leap from pillar to pillar or you're gonna go along the outer wall uh door aw it's if it's if I can climb across it yes okay give me a stealth check and an acrobatics Jackie 42 for my stealth well you need it you need it you need the 42 you needed the 42 got so many eyes and then acrobatics 25 what okay make your way across the room it's just climbing across the moaning forms of the onlookers from beyond all of these mournful Watchers regarding the grim fate of what has befallen the crypts of Dragon hymen she come towards the the pillar at the base of the cap at the base of the stair you can see that the this pillar of marble shot through with streaks of black and covered in engravings in what might even be dwarven is has shards and flecks of delirium stabbing into it that almost that each of the pieces of delirium that is embedded in into it it looks like almost the pieces of delirium this marble itself is kind of squeezing on them like a wound trying to heal and as where the sludge comes up against the base of it and the fleshy tendrils come up against it it's almost like a cauterized wound or an infection kind of red and thick and weeping like a sore and on the pillar as you look at the pillar and the the bumpy mass with these dwarven runes written across it you realize that the pillar itself is actually the shape of a man holding up the the top of the pillar and you can see that he's like the wounds are in his body himself and the whole of him has turned to stone and as you look the eyes of the stone figure open up and you see the face of your father I it takes everything in me not to yell out I'd go up to him and I just like touch his face and I I just say dad and the voice whispers you're invisible yeah so he can't see you my ears deceive me so you Vale you've gotten old you're grown up [Music] I I'm here to save you dad what I in my head I say guys my dad is here I see him what do you need us to do I don't know what to do he's he's stuck here it looks like he's I'd hoped that you'd come that I'd hear your voice I've been fighting for so long I'm trying to hold it up I can't hold it I can't hold it much longer I say you keep holding this up we are here to save you it keeps growing it just keeps crying guys he needs he needs help he needs to get out of here what do you want us to do dad how can I get you out of here I don't know something happened to the king on the throne it's up there in the throne room and it's trying to kill me but I fight for so long the throne and this pillar it's the head in the heart and I gave myself to it I tried to stop his will tried to stop him from it from taking control and I thought if I could hold for much longer I kept holding and I kept holding it till I turned to stone and I've been here for so long I never thought I'd hear your voice again well you're gonna keep hearing it cuz we're gonna get you out of here you need to keep holding on who's controlling this place something's happened to the king did you order the throne room is that more important than what this is this thing causing any trouble or is it the throne room do anything wrong room maybe we can save him by stopping what's in the throne room No yeah but not for long you won't it won't hold I've been trying to fight it but it's it just feels so strong you're the strongest man I know you keep holding on until we can get you out of here if you stops holding that pillar is this whole place gonna collapse the city is counting on you to keep this going until we can figure out what's going on we haven't been able to get in here in 15 years 15 years was that all it's been 15 years that's all that's it felt like I've been here for an age of the earth fighting every minute like a thousand years guys we need to get him help now Eldrick I showed it in my head Eldrick there's what weird magic going on here I found my father but he's stuck in this castle wait your your father is in is in the castle he needs help I need more information I can't I can't help you veo if you can't tell me what's going he's part of this pillar he's turning to stone he says that the king is doing something I think the king is causing all your safe are you in danger I'm safe for now but my father is in danger I need to save him we need time to think we need time to plan he doesn't have time if you do something reckless you might break any chance he has don't I know it you must feel terrible bail and the voice sounds out it says hell if you're here if you're here you've got to go you can't stay here it's not safe for you now watch her and we'll see you it will find you it will kill you I'm not leaving without knowing that I can come back to get you you have to destroy it you have to kill whatever's on the throne and then I can hold till then I've been holding for 15 years I can hold for another 15 if I had to fail get over there we can save him if we at least try to stop the thing on the throne you got to get out of there now we're gonna go to the throne he's doing what's right you will keep trying I will leave you here now but I'm coming back to get you something up on them there's something up on the throne something's happened there's that yeah it's like a mind it's like a mind underneath it all like a mind underneath the castle veil fighting you through the key through whoever's on that throne whoever's on that throne is gone it's like this other mind I'm trying I'm trying to fight it back but it it just wants to hold everything in its grasp I will burn it down to save you I'll be back and I touch his face one more time and I run to climb across okay give me a stealth in an acrobatic stroke thirty-eight stealth Wow it's like an auto 22 Wow as the lab trace and then acrobatics 17 okay you managed to leap across the walls and get back to our Sebastian as' I'm so invisible I grabbed you by like your collar and I started dragging you up wait you're invisible too where is everyone like I'm so scared I used my job at the SA Sebastian I'm back let's get out of here and I know we didn't need to do to save my dad yeah but I'm like looking around I up the stairs now are you okay my dad is your suffering for 15 years not okay you want to head to the throne er if we go up there I think we're gonna need more support anything gets the thing that's keeping everybody out and I think it's the thing that's causing so much chaos and darkness in this castle so what what is the next move there I think if we go up there we need to see and not enter and figure out what's our next step to take over this castle but we need to do it soon and now it's fighting my father and it's gonna kill him and take over this castle if we don't go soon okay lead the way and I run up the stairs and poke in the face as we go by yeah as I run by I grab Pluto's army oh it's been a minute yeah I probably like as I'm grabbing Pluto ice far longer than it oh okay oh I haven't been invisible for about I got an hour hopefully all the eyes are looking at me I run up into like the the the first room with the stone pillars and I just like I I'm like I need a minute and I just like crumpled to the ground I run to your side and I'm like hand on her back we pay you I knew if he was here it would be bad but not that bad we're gonna do whatever it takes for him we're gonna figure it out but we need to do it quickly suffering then let's go where is

the king i veo Sonia the Lord Commander of Dragon hime command you to open we only really need him back up and the after the wrestling match the two golems are back in their positions they wrestled a little bit you know it was a friendly match and they're there they're back resting and as you come through the doors slam shut and one of the gargoyles beefs up didn't like cause you had to see down there did you you know but come on no but I can tell by the look on your face just what they call you butts cuz you're always like but or is it because no yeah the second thing the second thing you were gonna say I'm stalling fail we need to go now well hey you two keep an eye out three keep an eye out special.you butts and then we go up the stairs in the room okay you take the stairs of the spiral up one level leading to a door which would open out onto the main level of castle dragon do you want to take that door or continue going upward where is the throne room 4th floor but you can get to the big is accessible from both the fourth floor and the fifth floor as Vale recalls there is a balcony we want that ring wire rings the top and yeah fifth floor for a vantage point yes okay all right I'm going all the way up but from this staircase we have to go over to the grand staircase correct or can we do it from this one you can get up you can get there from here okay up it's like day go let me start to run up the stairs Hong Kong Kong Kong Kong Kong sorry that's just what my sound is you're naturally gonna yell Sebastian thanks we're still passing without trace bye its key doesn't mean you should be singing no that was my armor was making that sense yeah that was my armor okay try the stairs lead up and the door opens into a wide hallway boat as wide as before the as you as wide as before the hall at the end of the hallway though is a massive stained-glass window turn tinted green and purple and as an effigy before the stained-glass window here is in clad of flesh and bone is a statue of a demonic figure the hallway extends down and as you come through the doorway you can see the top of the spiral staircase and the spiral stair actually continues from here it keeps going up the roof along this point is pointed and you you can see the rafters going across up to the rooftop from here because now this is the highest accessible level of the castle until you go up the towers beside you along this hallway are several couches and benches along the sides of the room and there is splatters of blood and gore all across the floors and there are reaching all around coming out from underneath the doors down the hallway are fleshy rotting tentacles like vines all through the hall through this way there are five doors on the eastern wall and a short hallway that leads to a set of double doors on the western wall which would lead into the throne room that is where the mass of tentacles and flesh comes from and we're on the fifth you're on the fifth floor so there's the throne room balcony and the Royal Apartments I've gotta check out the back balcony I can I can wait in the hallway if you are a sneaky in the hallway there's a statue of the demon as well as actually rather different than the one that you've seen before this one has almost a bovine face and where the other statues some of the other statues that you'd seen were all had big pot bellies this one is the the chest muscles and the abs of several creatures have been layered over all it will almost feel like a muscular chest and did where the other demonic statues that you've usually seen are very flabby and muscular and rotting this one is actually is muscular instead buff yeah and it has a problem instead of horns on it like a Minotaur yeah guys I'm starting to think that they're all the same demon just depends on who worships them the rat god orcas this thing could just be one of the same it's corrupting the creatures of Drac and I'm anything that the Delirium is touched anything that will listen to it a voice whispers out what I said was that your dad uh that wasn't all my dad he's such a thug he's a MRSA did it come from the statue yeah where is this - you turn to look at the statue and I just say Orcas how dare you call me by my brother's name oh boy okay guys I made it either it was a mistake there was a mistake I an incident what's the worst but what can we call you if it's not your brother's name in that guttural voice that I'm not gonna do again you didn't kill my voice it replies I am the heart of beasts this is my feasting home life is so much easier with one demon yeah I thought I could handle one demon now now there's at least two I think your brother is trying to encroach on your territory with the soul Lord of beasts thing have you seen outside here yes this has been quite a game brothers and sisters have played with this playground sisters we need somebody who knows about my brother would have you to think he's mastermind of it man we have issues and in my head I'm just like who do we know that knows lots of our demons we sure Matthias maybe yeah geez maybe this is outside the looking into the main room you're in the hallway in in the ground so each floor has a Great Hall that is all on top of each other yeah that connects to the great staircase and so this room if you take the doors to the east you'll be going through the Royal Apartments and if you take the double doors to the West you'll be on the balcony of death row okay so we're not even in the balcony I mean do you want to go look or do you want to keep talking to Orcus Aziz brother what's our what's our policy towards destroying effigies pretty strong we are before I just done for it I don't want to call anything that yeah I'm I don't know what's going on in this castle I make does it know that we're here like if we just walk in the hall it just sends all the like it told us that that's the feasting hall right what are you feasting on here Lord of beasts maybe you and you hear that thud oh boy coming from the Royal Apartments the doorways begin to shake all shudder I only have one immovable rod so let's work our way back towards the great staircase of
