description below for more with that let's return to the ruins [Music] Drakken homers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the Kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway caught him its rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon Heim when last we left our heroes the wheels were set in motion for our hero's assault on the stronghold of the queen of Thieves bringing together the forces of caspia the hooded lanterns and the rattling our heroes have planned an epic assault which shall be heading under way very very soon they have spent the past week preparing in the halls of the amethyst Academy's shattered tower where Sebastian spent several days insane trying to contact other planes and speaking with the spirit of his mother gaining more information and knowledge and insight as the hooded lanterns have been assembling their troops for the attack which hopefully whoa what is the goal what is your goal a couple goals don't we it's there's a list we have a large list get the list out this part of the list this is like subsection B 12 yeah huh goals and reckon I'm yep so this is called operation mayhem operation mayhem is a goal in which we acquire all of the badges that the queen of thieves currently has because she holds many and we can't let those badges stay in her grasp and we just hope she's not gonna get more of ours in the meantime so no don't worry there's no way that this plan could go robbery and mayhem has zero fall backs zero it's actually well calculated plan there's no chaos chaotic anyway anyway nothing could possibly go wrong so there's no way this well-crafted plan could horribly backfire no not at all stop ah not because she's been scrying on us we cast telepathic bond between Anson Pluto me veo River Jupiter yes number two your tone indicated more people laugh rats in the sewers blocking all the escapes so that anybody that tries to escape through secret passages down below yet eaten alive by rats we give the rattling a code word might need to be different than porkchops cuz I think our enemies might know that code work by this point so we might need to come up with a new code word only people escaping who give the proper code word will not be eaten honey-glazed there you go Honey Crisp Jupiter and his men blocked the street axis and caused a commotion drawing out the Queen's men hooded lanterns on the roofs back them up and keep everybody on the streets occupied and confused we free the lat rattling slaves that are being held prisoner and forced to work and start a revolt of the rattling causing chaos below and above then we cast seeming turning ourselves into Queens men infiltrating the base finding the bomb acquiring it finding the queen of Thieves destroying her and obtaining the badges flawlessly nothing can go wrong that's the worst that could happen can I add some stuff to that what I really like just to think about what if we find Queens men that we could impersonate like we find them beat them up and then wear those people but also we could we should also have vayo be our Tabac see negotiator with the slavers well we're not gonna seaming until I think that the slave camp of rattling that happened before the Sephora seemed so resuming is to go into the base and I I think vert you can be point on that to try to free the rap people yeah Ulta backsies get along right what I mean your head your other two vaccines for a long time you'll even been it was few and far between you'll try negotiating but we will be there to back you up with fire my fire is not working right now but I'll be there as you take your breakfast in the tower the aim of this Academy you are served a glorious hero's feast in in preparation so to reiterate the effects of the hero's feast for the amethyst Academy knows that you'll need all the help you can get so you will all be gaining whoa your hit point maximum increases by 18 and you are immune to poison being frightened and you make wisdom saving throws with advantage okay and the beneficial effects of it are going to last for [Music] 24 hours yep so as you take your breakfast than the the broomsticks and the serving platters and the unseen servants serve out the bracket of the your meal at the amethyst Academy eldritch comes down and sits down with you and says today is the big day yes yeah didn't sleep much last night been going over this plan about 400 times trying to make sure that it's an airtight airtight no room for error against the queen of Thieves men we received word that several of the Caspian forces are coming in from from the south so the they are a few days out in one of the larger cities to the south outside Drakon Haim they might be a little bit ahead of the silver order but oh that's good but from what I understand the there's a few important individuals with them yes do you do you want them to come to the city itself gluto I know it can be dangerous but my family their Caspian their warriors I I believe that they could meet up with the hoodie lanterns and and find not only refuge but also aid in the defense of the city yeah and I think they need to start to get accustomed to this new life that they're gonna live in dragon hi there you become one so have them meet at the barracks yeah they should they should head to the barrack in that case I will send a message town to Saul Jackson him George and your sister eros are all on their way from what I understand the whole family road trip do we get to be your sister you to be my sister are you gonna introduce me to your dad yes they've come with Annie no but you know several hundred caspian soldiers are on the way and there could be more as well I hope this will aid in in the fight for Drakon Haim and I know we have to keep thinking too about reinforcing the hood and lanterns as well yes through the means of mercenaries and and other hired help I will come with you to the barracks where River and I will set up your telepathic bond together so that it can last quite some time there as long as you've got all your spell's if there's any other resources that we can offer you potions scrolls please take a take of them now I think I got my ointment last time got another dose for this go-round yeah I uh I would love to recharge this cool ring it really helped that last time it was magical so magical yeah you guys can get your rings Church back up again and requisition any other potions or Scrolls that you might need from the Academy I would say that we'll be trying to watch but for all we can tell there are two issues with trying to use our magic to oversee how things are going on in the ruins the first is that the D pays itself Foyle's attempts at long-distance viewing with divination magic even the regular haze has similar effects the second is that we've known for some time that there is some sort of stronghold in Drakon hime that's been used for smugglers for generations even that someone or something warded magically were blind that's the I'm pretty sure we've been in there before could this also work both ways can we have maybe a little solace in thinking that maybe the Queen was unable to scry on us when we were in the D pays the amethyst Academy doesn't build our wards that way and I can only assume that whoever built this didn't did as well we can the Academy tower itself is warded to protect against such magics but it does not prevent those inside the tower from using their own powers to look at those outside I mean safe to say that anything we've said without telepathic bond has been seen if we assume that then compromised or anything that happens in these halls you can be rest assured it's safe that's good is there a like a call history on those screen warps can you see past users at all is there any there channeling points okay anything that is recorded is only kept by those who perform the spell themselves shall we be on our way yes I think I don't know if I said it before but in terms of spells storing for my ring just wondering if I could get silence and misty step yes yes and then I have shield on there from mark already cool so should be five levels think alrighty with that you depart out through through to the barracks itself it's early morning and the typical patrol of several of the armored automatons of the amethyst Academy and a good dose of aqua exper go keep send you through the ruins of the Academy district when you arrive at the barracks you're given time to recuperate from the aqua exper go and but already the whole barracks is a flurry of activity the hooded lanterns have now had enough time to recover and recuperate and Ansem and petra are out with some fresh recruits recruited from the nearby provinces and there is a platoon of caspian soldiers with Jupiter Jones that are engaged in military drills and all of them are unlike the the hooded lanterns the Caspian soldiers all have these square interlocking shields and long Pike's Pike formations and Jupiter Jones and several of the other lieutenants have them practicing blockade formations to blockade the streets it reminds me of home I feel really at home right now I actually feel a little better with all these people here preparing to help us out you're not alone you're not alone I think we need more for the queen of Thieves no for the upcoming war I don't think this is going to be enough even with caspia no but for the battle at hand against the queen of Thieves oh yes of course but yeah we have the whole Caspian army on their way they should be here I check my magic timepiece should be here in a few days yeah as you head into the barracks the Lord Commander as they are with his the Lieutenant Commander Lord commanders with lieutenant commander Elias Rexel is there brooding over the plans and he greets you and salutes it says Lord Commander welcome back we're ready to go out here the Caspian czar well-disciplined as well they'll be a suitable addition to our forces as expected from such a noble household course but we we want to make sure that we don't discuss our plans though the others indeed River Eldrick Jupiter Petra and some come into the meeting and led by River and eldritch and Sebastian you form a telepathic bond between the group now that we can talk in private now that we have how's everybody feeling I'm feeling good unlike the Noles the Queen's men are undisciplined bandits most of them will run away at the sight of a dedicated assault we expect a very little resistance from them and what little that they will put up with we'll take them down there are a few things that I should mentally prepare everybody for mentally because I'm talking telepathically I was a joke thank you enough jokes there is a chance that the queen of thieves has other creatures that might fight with her it's not just the Queen's men that we need to be careful of we're hoping to sneak in and not be noticed as long as we go unnoticed it means that there's a chance that the most dangerous of her forces could be sent out to help out on the surface it's going to be difficult for us to conceal our advance in the immediate period we're gonna have to be marching through the outsides of the cities the Caspian won't be able to hide their approach they'll know that we're coming yes have we told you about what we faced when we were in the Queen's lair what what do you mean she may have with her a monstrosity larger than any man breathes haze tiny arms though so I mean the arms aren't a big problem for the arms but it's it's pretty scary it's the reason why we lost the bomb to the queen of Thieves it's the reason why we were taken captive because we lost a battle against that creature now I don't know it's probably had enough time to heal back we did wound it quite a bit but I think we also go New York yes we got close to killing it so I'm hoping that with enough fire on the creature if you do see it take it down Lord Commander how many of the hooded lanterns are you taking with you for the sewers through the sewers I thought you were going in underground correct we are we are are we taking any of our men with you our mission underground is more of a espionage mission we are going to be going in disguised I understand we also have recently discovered that the queen of thieves has people being held prisoner I use the term people loosely people there there are they have prisoners down in the caverns and sewers below that are being forced to mind delirium we do plan to interrupt that and hopefully cause a revolt of whatever prisoners there are down there Pluto Jackson speaks up now I'm to understand your boys the Academy created some sort of explosive we know that this isn't just some trick by the queen of thieves to lure all our forces in and blow us to smithereens that's what stops her from doing that that's a really great question that is why we list is it on the list I don't think the Queen would waste that bomb on such an attack as this I also don't want anybody to approach the Queen's lair to the point where you're getting inside your job is to keep the streets occupied I have to say that I Lord Commander with respect we're talking about annihilating the queen of thieves and her forces in an annihilation strike what's stopping her from using this weapon against us I would even say that we're looking to go after the queen of Thieves her forces are a bunch of hooligans keeping her occupied on the surface is gonna allow us to get in and make way to getting to her very well maybe there's an opportunity here to lead her to believe that the strike force won't be overwhelming maybe we can trick her on the battlefield into thinking that she has the upper hand what if only a few people go in draw the Queen's men out and draw them down the streets and read them out and keep the fighting chaotic operation mayhem yeah it'll be challenging she'll be able to chill it's not I know that our men Lord Commander they can stay stealthy and conceal their true numbers the cassadines can't I think what's gonna work best on the surface is if we go in in many smaller parties rather than one big one I know the we work best in smaller parties and the caspian x' well pair them with a couple of us on the ruse and we can cause a lot of trouble for them if they can break off into smaller groups and occupy several different passages and alleyways the queen of thieves won't have a specific target to bomb yeah we'll keep it very well where she can we'll keep everyone spread out and we'll await your word as soon as you've secured that let us know and we'll let end the rest of her the Rose the other hope is that by causing some chaos down in the with the people who are being held prisoner that might direct split her attention in several different directions so she won't have an obvious target we are the obvious target and we're hoping to go in and surprise her well we're we as ourselves are not planning on going in no we will be going in disguised as Queens men very good is the reason telepathic bond can we still communicate we limited amazing so keep us in the loop to about any surface issues Lord Commander before we march out do you want to address the soldiers yes Pluto Jackson would you like to address the Caspian absolutely very well we'll head out to the yard and you can talk to the soldiers with that the you head out onto the you head out into the yard where the hooded lanterns and the Caspian czar assembled but almost well over two hundred people the fear of public speaking and the Lord Commander the Lieutenant Commander gestures towards you Aveo and he says to the Troops soldiers our Lord Commander vo Sonya hey y'all alright so we're gonna go in to this battle with our heads held high and our tummies full ready to cause some ruckus around the city who's with me and when you get back we'll have an extra treat waiting yeah hi for everybody yes I don't know what's in it yet but yes hi for everyone and of course for those who are supporting the Caspian 's give them all the all the support that we can all of the manpower that we can already dad there's a raucous cheer at that give me a performance check eyeliner illusion some fireworks three three okay the troops clap they're a little uneasy it's clear that everyone's a little uneasy about this but they are enthusiastic and in and looking forward to that pie yes by the although the applause does die pretty quickly that's fun never no talker huh Sebastian Sebastian are just excited gluto what are you gonna say again I approach the podium it's a podium no it's just it's a wooden deck that's raised that that one around wasn't sometimes used as a gallows unless you speak up in front of the entire group I look out to the the sea of worried faces men Caspian men drew draconian mend wrecking Brecon hiney and men and women and women this is the fight of your lives now for some of us we are far from home but this is what you trained for for the enemy is the enemy of order the queen of Thieves she is a rabble rouser and the scum of the earth and we will take the fight to her for caspia for Drakon hime and for the good of everything that Westham R stands for and then I'm gonna pull out Ignatius she and I and I just hold it high are you with me yeah make your performance check with advantage whoa twelve twelve there's a moment where the the a brief ray of sunlight strikes Ignatius and it glimmers and the soldiers are like the blade have saved the true vo oh and they clap and they're like kospi are strong I can only speak the truth when I hold this sword and I speak this truth to you now we will slay the queen of thieves and rid Drakon hime of all that is evil and unholy for we stand with the light huh there's Cheers I would vote for him there's cheers and applause and with that the groups begin to assemble and March are just so good and then you see me I come back I just I blocked out why did I a what happened you do the best speech I've ever heard Ignatius took over I think some of that uh and as Victor this is two of you leave the leave the stage River and Eldrick come up to you Sebastian and say Sebastian yes do well good luck I always do my best River says don't don't die they're going to give a few were we're saying that a few the others were saying that they would like to you to give a class on meta magic and a few in the new curriculum so oh well I haven't died this far so don't count on it today be safe because I want to I want to get paid for teach I'd like to get paid for teaching thank you alright with that the hooded lanterns set out through there their pathways and the Caspian March for march south both of these groups will actually need to do a quite large march around the outskirts of the city so it will take them a little while to get into place because the Caspian have to cross the water of the city so they have to go out to Ford and the hooded lanterns also have to use the ferries and the various waterways to get across to buckle down row where the queen of thieves has her lair you yourselves though are headed off in a different direction we're gonna meet the reference Jen Laurie we have to meet the rat Prince okay a week after we said yeah we're a little late you head down to the party through the ruins of the sprawl taking sticks is ferry as you do across the drain river to the spokes heading through the ruins towards champions way you find with a little bit work you can enter the sewer at Styx's Ferry or you can head through the ruins themselves and enter the sewers a long champions way either way you should be able to find weather where you've agreed to meet the rat prince I think champions Way figure it out and go you move through the sewers you move through the city streets pardon me towards champions way where you find a sewer entrance along one of the intersections where several the older buildings are still standing intact you can see further down the street that there's the odd scream shouts and whoops in the distance the sounds of battle and you happen to pass a group of falling fire pilgrims as they head up champions way towards the the gate it's a large group about 40 people most of them either very elderly and about a dozen children with several of the other zealots leading the way of this Caravan towards them do they have the delirium in their chest if they do their their clothes such that it is not visible okay they're bringing kids closer to the crater yeah I was wondering how far they are in their ritual I think that after we're done we just blow them all up we get the bomb back and we you head into the sewers pulling up a manhole cover and taking a slimy grease covered ladder down into the sewer below as everything in the city oh it smells and of course resident it's the smell of the Drakon hime sewers are not fresh sewage because the sewers haven't been working properly for 15 years and the it is a sewer system that was meant to accommodate sewage of almost a hundred thousand people so after 15 years of rain and less use the sewer smell not of waste but more of the soft smell of mud and a little justice whiff of old corpses classic yeah that's that's dragon I'm for you and as you make your way down through the sewers there's from out from one of the sewer lines around the corner you hear a familiar voice hello ghosts yes yes yes you come you come just as you said you would yes yes yes right on time question what's the lighting like right now it's pitch black you're down in the sewers I have no idea can see me yeah yeah the only light is the light that you have I'm gonna turn on the drift globe yes to make a nice so the rats off steps out of out of the purple light from the says yes yes we've

Scrolls in a bag and she adjusts her glasses and and she's got her tail which is holding her pen and she puts down the books and unfurls this what looks like a rather accurate map of the city and she she looks and says we've gone and we talked to those that are living in or near here and here and many many many there there has been much much more many many new number roll out the numbers for me

the ecosystem Drakken time and now the rattling oh boy okay this is this is when from a day one problem so like a end-of-days problem odo there art says says screeches she squeals with delight yes I

it'd be good it'd be good and the rat princess yes yes yes my new girlfriend have a good plan yes yes yes she come with us yes yes yes and I lick my lips who's your new girl I'm looking hungry at them yes yes and he says any gestures towards the shadows this come come come out show them show them show them and there's there's a moment we're in the edge of the darkness down the sewer what was darkness all of a sudden lights up as you see all these softly glowing purple rat eyes light up and it's just this almost like the whole hallway is lit up with the glowing purple eyes of the rattling x' and out from one of them comes big nose he's limping forward like yes all these good very very good very good and and with him comes this albino rattling she's perfectly white with red with like her eyes are flipped the other color so they're they're red and she's wearing the skull of an OL as a hat and she's carrying a staff that has skulls of various others on it and she edits shakes and

the rat god but we'll take more blessings I'll take more blessings if you have it yes yes yeah they could make me smarter and several um I don't several other eiling's come forward and they you smell this ozoni like smelling the errands you hear this bubbling noise as a group of rattling start dragging this cauldron forward on wheels and the inside is this bubbling smoking purple liquid it's like aqua delirium but with the consistency of mud and squeak supreme stair squeaks takes out a skull off of her staff that's had that top of it carved off it's like a bowl she takes the skull and dips it into the liquid and she says yes rock god teach me this yes yes it makes you strong it makes you grow it makes you smart and fast yes yes yes come I take some every later you not believe me no I I do

why show you big nose suffer much big nose hurt much yes yes yeah he looks like a good drink and big nose takes the skull and he says gosh it okay I drink racket and big nose drinks the liquid and then he starts convulsing and shaking on the ground no and he starts to shudder and froth at the mouth and all of a sudden this big bulbous almost like tanker starts growing out of his back and it explodes in a shower of gore and these bone spines grow up from his spines and he starts growing and growing and growing until he becomes this monstrosity larger than an ogre and he looked down and and another arm sprouts out from underneath and he looks down and he says oh oh I feel hungry mmm and squeaks says oh yes just many many secrets yes yes yes yes we use many are great heroes this now yes yes yes we're gonna have to kill them afterwards I accept I'm in shock can I have the skull she dips the skull in the liquid I'm just enhance it to you especially you got to let us know what your plan is so we can help it I need you guys to distract them right now just for a moment just for a moment I'm going to cast with the drift globe I want to make it do daylight the blasts of light goes in all the right angles in the moment that they do I pour out the skull pop open a grape flavored soda young pour it into the skull make a deception check 27:26 okay so you pour it out and it's and the sodium's in in there the light flares down and and all the rattling ZAR like to play to brave why you do why you do that my apologies young rattling the drift globe can be uncontained power it is a sign from the rat God on the glory that you have bestowed upon us I linked now lets me drink I want to be get as powerful as big no you will all drink from it yes I take a sip and i feverishly and then I passed it to Vale and then I to the ground and I start going and then I'm going to stand back up and minor illusion can I minor illusion us all having purple eyes I can only do like one thing yeah you can all make a group deception check with advantage for Sebastian oh good 21 0 25 as you ride on the ground The Rasmus turns to - squeaks and says they not changing they are changing something wrong amen Supremes supreme seer squeezes a weak body and human body not strong enough to take blessing of record I I stand up and I'm going to minor illusion now my voice my own voice echoing through the chamber and I just stand up and go I feel powerful and have an echo through the entire chamber around them oh and I'm gonna have my scarf start billowing in the lack of wind and squeak says maybe they make improvements to formula I talk to record no the feeling is inside our power is inside remember we are ghosts and we react differently to magic we could not show you are you like yes you like species yes scratches have good brain she's very very smart she had many plans and and screeches says yes I make my own - fine Gil Timman yes he's yes Gilda the men they have the fire fire fire shooty shooty sticks yeah yes yeah you stole the we still are you're going to steal no we steal them can you show us we feel them with our own thing it's very good Oh with that stuff would you feel there with when you spray it on human they go block oh it's so funny that's not terrible as long as we can continue to pull this off just until the end of this mission but also just on that note can we get some in a spray bottle because that could be really helpful it's like the GU times ten maybe we should get one of the can we have one of your machines that sprays the stuff or do you need yes you have guys I think it sprayed on self after we're done with the queen of Thieves we need to get all of the rattling stew meat for a commune with the God and we need to blow them up and then you see so next after we get the humans here I have map and all the other raccoons rats they dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig and see you see we're human half castle you see where humans have fought did you get into the castle have you been oh no no no no not yet not not yet but we digging under human fort and she points on the map where the hooded Lantern's baricza's whoa well then she points to where the silver orders fort is not as she points to where st. Selina's Abbey is and she's and she says yes and it demo it'd be so good I make good plan yes yes and I take my so excellent scimitar and I slam it down on where the hooded Lantern's barracks are and I say you stopped digging here right now okay we almost done anyways I will not be responsible for my actions if you hurt any more of the green caped men and women why you not want hurt that baby new things you see my green cape and I show them I yes it's nice to disguise are you currently the Mannings we they shoot us they kill us we kill them eat them make us strong we currently have the green cloaks manlings under the control of the rat god can we eat them not yes at the end once they're desert once the queen of thieves is done once we're finished with this plan we will have a large meeting to commune with the rat god and we will talk about how we will destroy all the man well what about teen men I like canned food they yeah look like him guys the Caspian Sea no that's what I mean the one only the ones with the fire sticks yes fire sticks for now only for the today there are many rattling x' they're getting very hungry they come to me they say rap prince we hungry a few more days and then you can you said that lesson this is the last plan that we need you for know the last plan that we need you for and then we enact your plan after a meeting we have to have a large meeting with all of the I don't understand why you have us wait squeak says rat got ready the mission that we have you doing today relies on them doing their part as well to make sure that it's easier for us to take over the whole city we strong now we dig tunnels all places yes yes see that you've done up we come up from below from the deep places of the earth where we make our burrows and we come up and we eat the Mannings have you that what we want die one rat God promised us and I'm have you finished the tunnel to the hooded lanterns to the NI to the ICANN appointed them on the map oh yes yes yes and where scratches can you show me where the tunnel approaches she she pointed points to it and she she shows the map and it's it's scrawls and it looks like the rattling 'z have done like a honeycomb of tunnels all underneath the city because we can just we should inform Ansel and the rest of the headed lanterns just to be aware yeah and they can potentially just lock a door guard against any sort of tunnel effect at least for now they're gonna be wondering how we know that they're gonna be wondering how we know that I know but we're not to confess eventually I mean as long as they don't do anything until we just need them to be okay until we deal with the queen of Thieves and then we need to gain you just and and you just we get them all in one place and you firewall everything I think I say we get the bomb back and we just blow them all ha it is so exciting yes yes yes I have so many children now there are too many of us the human never see it coming they have weapons yes yes yes they think they have enough but they do not there are too many of us now they'll never see it coming and then once we take over this city yes yes yes yes yes once it all ours then we dick dick dick dick dick dick dick to next mantling city and then we do that we did dee dee dee dee come up and then go to next one and next one is next one Robbie my most trusted rat Prince friend when we finish this mission can you meet me back at the statue to your God and we can talk which statue the one that they were yes yes which one we make me anymore oh do you guys have a central meeting location for all the rattling x' to come so that we can talk about how where we will you come last time we beat the house the house after we're done this mission we all need to meet there and we'll plan your attack on the surface on the manlings we will kill just says why you need an eye smart lady I made great plan why you meant try to take away my plan that I make we are ghosts you said men oh no no screeches screeches fall not a man a really good plan I worked really hard on it it all ready to go and you come in here being like no no no no no you don't you just don't like it cuz it was not your idea Pluto turn out the lights for a second turn out the lights sure so I they can't see me in the dark regardless a dark vision I'd go up to scratches and I grab the back of his neck and I get really close to his face and I say her sorry we are ghosts not men she looks at you and her eyes are glowing really strong purple and she says catch rat got teach me to see what I cannot see that's how I learned to read yes you want to intimidate me I smart I smart I know things I see things and you can see me eating you if you don't settle down and I toss her to the ground no no no yeah we don't need to get responsibility the mission scratches your plan sounds amazing plans work best when you meet when you get all of the people in charge to meet beforehand so that we can all hear the plan make sure that we know what our roles are in that plan so that we can execute it perfectly that's how we've always done plans that's why we're having this meeting with you right now you guys already know our plan but we want to make sure that everybody does their job properly we want you to stand before us at a meeting tell us all your plan all of the rattling 'z us in front of the god to make sure that we do it right we honor the rat God make a persuasion check sixteen by we talked me tell you what to do absolutely yes yes yes it all very good no need to fight your screeches you're very good friend of rap Prince shadowy ghost really good friend of reference the fiery ghost really good friend of reference Shane he goes - really good friend of reference now we have paths big nose show us which way to go does he still have a big nose he has a huge now how many of it we block all sewers we dig dig dig dig dig dig dig which way you want to go you said that there were other rattling x' that were being held prisoner yes we free them yes yes yes we will the first step we show you those rattling I come with you and they're there the rat Prince yeah do we actually need to refresh your I was just thinking that I mean do we need any we want them to trust us we have to follow through with that part of the plan because that was something that we already said to them yep we're committed the reference he says come come come and the rattling x' bring out a black cloak and the rat prince puts it on and he they gave him this this majesty and he puts it on and it's the these it looks like it looks like he's appropriated in executioner's hood and it's just these strips of flat of these strips of fabric that come down his head and then just have two pieces carved out for his eyes and then his nose just to stick out and then another another three rattling is come forward and they have these jagged blades that look like raw pieces of the meteoric iron that still have shards of delirium in them and there's three of them and the rat prince grabs one the other and his tail comes up and grabs the third and he says I'm ready to fight with you you're ready to kill ya yes yes I never more was Prince petunia yeah yeah petunia was well that's because petunia was we could control her I think we've lost control we've lost control now we're just simply just trying really hard to steer this like this operation may have guys we've committed operation ma'am oncoming train wreck and we just need to steer it in the right direction for a moment and then members of the traffic and push it off the tracks we have to derail this train but you have to light this whole place on fire there's a whole place needs to be on fire you can't back out now because we are currently surrounded by how much mold Druid can you mold earth all of these tunnels closed no no like right now I can I could collapse under all these tunnels like I'm staring at the severity of this honeycomb pattern oh I thought I thought I was in control this sounds like every other incident but this one's way we created the worst incident oh my god this is the worst that could have happened as the enemy of our enemy is our friend can we take some solace it's everything's gonna be fine right absolutely find us that that we're not absolutely we just need to make it to that meeting with a bomb we just need to make it to that meeting with a bomb yeah that's it that's that's the heads and downwards so to save the rattling x' yep yes yes yes let's go yes yes yes big-nose come with us good and big nose rears his three arms back and he smashes through one of the sewer walls revealing a tunnel and he says dish way yes yes yes this is so bad we should just let them run the show I think they've got this now to be abandoned recommend King Robert King reverence reverence for King we said it backing yeah we made it happen big nose and the rat Prince lead you through this hastily burrow tunnel deep deep into the earth there is no light but the light of the orb and you can hear that it's that and as you go down there's several like regular giant rats that are following along with you and the references these my young ones they want to come to what it takes your kids to work day they gotta learn at some point they grow up so quickly literally stop sounding so distressed when you say those things get this way they yes Pluto yes they lead you through the narrow twisting passageway big nose can barely fit as he crawls through and it and it ends in a stone wall this cavernous wall and you can see as you're heading down there are bits of delirium in the tunnel almost like veins of mineral underneath the earth and as big nose leads you through to where the the tunnel ends whereas there's this small hole maybe 18 inches in diameter and you can see that there is light on the other side and you can hear the sounds clinking noise clink clink clink and then you hear this other voice say get to walk you ghh of a cracking whip so mean the whole ends and on the other side of it you can see that there's this stacked wooden crate and there's a glow of red and purple coming up through the hole what do you do I'm going to turn off the drift globe do you want me to have a potion of invisibility and take a look sure okay I like that I cuz you have to write three three yeah that's great idea I pop up potion of invisibility okay and I walk towards the light quietly you could probably squeeze through this hole it would be tough but you could definitely see and I'm holding on to Sebastian when I do it silently make a self guide you okay 23 you squeeze out through the hole and you are in a large underground cavern the ceilings of which reach up maybe about well in this part of it the the ceilings reach up about 20 feet in height and it branches out in what direction you are right now you have no idea but it branches out in two directions one this sneaking tunnel and the other towards this large reinforced large reinforced tunnel as well the room that you're in is about 40 feet wide and 20 feet high and there's a large deck that has been scaffolding down on which is sitting on a barrel holding a crossbow is a two back sea man and he has a scarf wrapped over his muzzle and goggles on and he has the crossbow poised and in front of him on the ground below there is a mine track laid out and there is a group of frat Ling's pushing a minecart for there are these veins of delirium all through the cavern and the rattling czar chained up to each other and their clinking at the my at the delirium and breaking the shards out and loading it onto the minecart and then pushing it down along the chain as their the this these two other two back see on the ground level crack the whips and gallop them to work faster are they what what are the other two boxes look like this is the first time I've seen them in like they are all wearing goggles and they all have scarves built up so you can just kind of see the tips of their nose and their and their ears picking up over one of them is orange one of them is calico and one of them is kind of a tabby gray it like ashy gray color one of them is carrying a whip the other two are carrying and has what looks like a spear on that he's carrying so he's got a whip and a spear and he's cracking the whip at them and the others both have crossbows as well and they are all guarding pretty nice leather armor there's only three of them I need to back see living was this good down here I might not join these guys literally now with your newfound hatred towards the right people I mean as they do this as the rattling is pushed or push the cart towards the the large exit three augers step forward and all of them are where and all of the ogres have big goggles on their faces as well and they have masks over there their mouths and all of them are wearing big heavy leather aprons and carrying shovels or or a mining pick as well or carrying shovels and they have these big heavy Forge master style and as the as the rattling is push up the minecart the ogre shovel out the bits of delirium and like crack them and are then put them into crates and boxes and you and move them into the next chamber there what do you see I'd to relay all this information you got a couple of big guys in here but it's the Tyvek sees I'm worried about I know how is shifty we can be is there a is how many Tamaki are there there's three three is one of them closest to you how far away is that very close so if we look up right over here where I guess I mean maybe on the other side I was it this hole here yeah yeah so there's two two back see on the train and then there's this one which is the third two back see which is at the big fat orange one up on the on the deck above and these guys are down here and then there's the three ogres by the one minecart and rattling is working they oh can you maybe take some time to find out where they're sending this delirium like who's running this operation I could also she's invisible right now but I also have a crow that I can look through if you need other eyes because I'm wondering if like is this the Queen's operation is this another force that we're totally unfamiliar with is this like this information that we were given was from the rattling 'he's right like no other force in dragon hime has told us about kind of any sort of like delirium mining operation I'm interested to see who's behind it all yeah I was before we start anything by before we kill everything I would assume the Queen I was also thinking if we do decide to engage in combat my micro can make can mimic sounds and I was thinking maybe we could lure that close to Maxie but over to this hole do you have any can you cast spells through your familiar touch spells yes go up and give it give us something you like do any suggestions spells or how about awesome I mean there's not a lot of room to move around down here without potentially running into something I'm worried about walking around and I say this like yeah yeah I'm worried about walking around too much I don't know how much of a surprise we're gonna get coming through this tiny hole though if anything it might be more beneficial to bottleneck them through here could you maybe cause a distraction somewhere oh I mean I can cause a distraction it's just where do you want it and how what level to let us to let us get in cuz that this whole I don't think I could fit through this all this 18 inch hole you could fit through it with difficulty like I feel like the surprise will be big-nose just making it a lot bigger no you just have a peek and then that kind of like we follow the followers lead I think yeah if big-nose takes the lead on this and just smashes through this wall like that's a that doesn't really give a surprise though do you want it like do you want to try to there's the one standing right in front of you what if we just tried to lure him back here do we know that the two backs you're bad go no see that's the thing I want to know who's behind all this and invades again it's your comfortability but do you think there's any chance you could figure out where all these minecarts are going or see if who else is like who else is like the who's the floor operator who's the manager I have an idea vo is invisible right now I am what if I polymorphed her into a fly that's great yeah then you could just zip around I can do that do you want to come back now so you can see me yes I can see you right in front of me through the hole can you see it as a fly your mental capacity will be vastly reduce oh that's true what about wind creature like an owl Arab she wants something so obvious how about not a rat well she's currently invisible yeah true I'm invisible I guess I can try to sneak through people you're pretty stealthy and you could use pass without trace you can't cast anything without becoming visible not sure but I can I'll see what I can do I've got a I'm pretty sneaky um in worst case to you do you have any disguises that you could put on couldn't you just disguise yourself as one of the other two vaccine I don't know who they know though I mean I could just be added back C so what would you like to do I am going to start to sneak past the rattling x' along following the cart okay we're past the ogres kind of like skirting around cool you slip past the ogres make a stealth check twenty-two okay you come up to them at the beat as you come past where the ogres are shoveling the Delirium and there are there is this big mine opening it's been supported with wooden beans and the mine cart actually ends here there's a stopper on the track and at the base here there's this wooden platform that's been constructed with beams going all the way up because you look up and there is a shaft that reaches up about a hundred feet straight up and you can see that they have built an elevator with ropes chains and pulleys and there is a platform that is descending down to this level it's descended down to this level that the ogres are loading up and there is a human man that is he has his mouth his hand over his mouth and he has thick goggles on and like his almost this entire like leather mask over his entire face and it comes out into this cone shape over his mouth and the goggles and he is holding on to the rope and watching as the ogres load the pieces of delirium and the meteoric iron onto the platform and as you look up you can see the that there are several other openings all through the shaft going all the way up to the top which is then open as well or you can see at the very top of the hundred-foot shaft there is a wooden deck that's been constructed that it looks like the platform could raise up and sit directly flush with hmm hey guys I think I'm gonna go up be careful yeah if you need any help please let us know if we need to cause some issues done here okay and I'm gonna before she goes up I tell big-nose that if I give them a signet if I give you a signal I want you to smash through that wall the rat princess whispers what's going on what are we waiting for we're cat go the cat is investigating the area to make sure we know where all of our enemies are and where the rabbit is good always good to know where your food is exactly I am so that the elevator is down or the could at the bottom of the shaft how much room is there once the Delirium and everything is loaded on not a lot there's just the narrow platform where the man like it looks like there's enough room around the sides that another person could stand on the other side if it was empty the whole bucket itself is about five feet by five feet wide so more than one person could stand like you could get one of the odors in here so like anyone that would be going up this if the Oh were going up they would have to go up one at a time you could probably get about six of the rattling Zin here and a few people could go in it at a time but it's it's relatively small is there anything that I can see maybe on the bottom that I could grab on to as it rises up it's the wooden planks ah it's like the planks underneath you could probably hold on to one of the side pulleys and I'll just support your weight off the side of it as it rises up but you might bump against the scrape against the sides of the chamber doing that I mean if you're invisible why not just get on top of the boxes I'm gonna get on top of the boxes but I take out my a movable rod just in case okay cool it takes the ogres about 20 minutes to finish loading the the whole bucket mm-hmm and then the the human man says hurry up it makes me sick to beat out here because the haze is palpable down here mm-hmm and with that he he pulls another rope on there it says all done hoist her up and the winch begins to go and the hoist rises up squeaking as it goes up and as it rises up you can see that there are at least five other offshoots of the shaft two of them are other mine tunnels with with other ogres and Tabac see with groups of rattling and as it goes up to one of the top levels there's another set of caves and you just glimpse out and you can see that there are dozens of cages and cells that have been constructed in this cave as you pass it and you can see several rattling shuttering inside one of the inside the cages and then found rattling the you pass up another one that is a similar set a set of caves that have been worked a little bit more that have more more cages but they're empty and then it goes up to the very top with a sudden stop and you're in this large room of mostly work stone it's still slightly cavernous but you can see that effort has been made to support the natural cavern here and build over the floor with like wooden planks and snow and flag stones and there's the the large machinery of the pulley itself which is operated by a single auger turning a winch or actually there's a pair of them that are that are turning it together as a group and there's this long wide hallway that stretches back and you realize this hallway is not a regular hallway it's actually a part of the sewer system that has been cleaned out and dried out entirely and there have been planks all set across it and this sewer tunnel extends out into the end of the darkness there's a large cart waiting here with a pair of oxen and another set of double doors leading off the room and another pair of ogres at the top that start loading the Delirium into boxes on the cart and loading it up okay I'd hate to be this guy but if you waited twenty minutes there's no way you're still invisible in one hour well it's one hour for the potion of then never mind I will no it's good to know because we're use bourbon crunch okay good call them guys I have an idea and um before I say this the the elevator itself could I is it all the way to the walls or is there room if somebody happen to go to the edge that the when the elevator is in place there's like a six inch gap it's like mind the gap on the subway like it's it's enough that someone could get their leg caught in there and mangle them really badly but not enough that they would fall down the shaft it unless the elevator itself wasn't present here but when it's present here on this level it it sits flush have you been telepathically relaying this all to us yes yep what do you what do you think of this this here's a question you saw those cages with the rattling Xin it it did what if you go back to those cages set them all free we barely have to do anything here's what I'm thinking we could just let the rattling kind of take care of this whole issue and then we go up there turn into queens men and we play it up like we have to report what's going on down here that there's been a revolt tonight for me we could turn into the Tabac seas are we confident though that sure if it is run by the Queen's men were there any signs of like the people that we've seen or anything that the Queen's men don't aside from the gang members they don't wear markings and these people are but the the quality of the equipment that they're wearing reminds you of the group that attacked you okay what I worry about is if we start causing a ruckus if I let those rat links go they're gonna bring some bigger heavier stuff down so what I'm thinking is if we can get them to start bringing the elevator down I can use my moveable rod to stop the elevator and I can let the rattling come down one of the things that you can see is that with the shaft and the way the writings have been jammed in here there's it's hard to get out of the rattling cells unless they're carried out on the elevators railings can't climb things like to vex you can of course hmm how many how many odors are at the top two there's there's four ogres at the top there's two that work the winch and to that load the cart hmm and then there's two other human men with them that are ordering them around plus the driver of the cart all of them are clad in leather armor and all of them are wearing these masks that have the goggles and that extended nose down over their face and noses we might just have to make a ruckus do we make the ruckus and then yeah I think the idea is we make a ruckus we kill any non rattling yep then we go up this elevator turn into Queens men or like similar to what these guys look like and then act like we're escaping I like the idea of too boxy because that's what they're expecting down here and it also obscures our faces a lot so it would be if we killed the taxi that are down here we could just assume their truth or threesome I call tabby go Orange fine calico wait yeah I'll be the gray wait grayza tableau craze tabby I guess I'll be the calico because it's it just reminds me of my obviously I'll be the big orange cat um for fire what do you want to do about these four ogres appear I feel like we need to leave some food for our rad friends yeah they'll and I mean by the time we get up when we go up the elevator that's when well I'll cast seeming on us but if there's too much noise they might come down what if we end the rattling Zeke them there's way more just to be clear there's the four ogres at the top but there's three other mine shafts there's three other mine tunnels off the main shaft and as you pass them there's groups of Overson to back C down all of them as well there's probably all said and done there's probably about a dozen ogres down here and several other to back see that are working down the shafts and dozens of rattling yeah there's a there's a lot of ogres down here yeah but there's also a lot of rattling and it might help send the numbers a little bit like so we we could we could we're due for a thinning all right so you want me to come back down what how can how does seaming work can you walk us through seaming because maybe we start by seaming ourselves as two back see and then go I mean I'm already the last eight hours worked any number of creatures that I can see within 30 feet of me can you can you constantly have to concentrate no and if we attack does it reveal that were our selves if we do action system no I don't think so because we could just start by becoming the ones down here and then just let loose the rats and then I would ask that was run terrorize them facing themselves and and like they could yell and scream and I mean when somebody comes down here and just are like passed and the the it looks like the ogres are finishing up unloading up here come back down get back here we're going to disguise ourselves and then we're going to attack and start the rattling revolt operation mayhem how do I make them make the elevator go down well as they if they finish unloading the shaft begins to lower down but it lowers down to the topmost mine tunnel and then the ogre start loading the elevator here and there's still not enough room on the sides for me to get around you could slip around and it's only at the top because imagine the the shaft itself and then they built a deck around the top at the very top where it was like a platform but yeah and get through right where's on the other levels they've just got a platform that sticks out onto it they haven't built this whole thing all around around it you could climb down I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave the elevator exactly where it is and I can always come up and and take the right away that way we're not getting ambushed too much we can come ticket bye-bye tear okay yeah absolutely I'm fostering setting the Robert kind of slip down along this no I don't use anything you'll become invisible the rod yeah if I use the rod yeah if you do any actions or anything just get back here it's okay okay or if you feel comfortable doing that it only ends attack attack success spell so yeah all good you could activate the removable rod yeah yeah so I wanna as I'm hanging onto like the edge of the elevator I take the immovable rod and I click it so that way it's in the middle of the underside of it yeah okay sounds good and then I was and I start to break my way down okay you climb back down to the bottom of the shaft the the three ogres are are sitting down taking a lunch break while they wait for the rattling Stu load up more delirium in in the waiting area buy it by the mineshaft guys do you want me to grab some deliriously no you're not yet you're always thinking with their wallets and our summers I'm gonna have to get lots we have to get luck you try to head back yeah I try to head back to the give me a self check be ready be ready for 20 okay you slink back and reunite with a group and then I their face as well in there - what happened okay what are you guys gonna do I'm gonna cast so first I turn to the rattling so I'm like it's time for operation mayhem are you ready what is this we're gonna change our form to look like our enemies but don't kill us how will they know change our ghostly figures a cow we know well look at us right now and see what we look like / if we use the word this very confusing okay no wait will still transform into them but we will the key word what's our key word our secret word is the rat god hail rock not if we sound good hail rock god don't it's okay screaming that and we know it's you yeah discuss before you kill any although then they have to ask everybody yeah we don't want that just look okay anyway we got it we're okay hail rock god we're gonna take our break right here and when we come back we're gonna roll for initiative and we are back from our break mmm but before we delve back in I want to give a big shout out to tabletop audio

got 18:18 for bayo for for Sebastian there's a cloth does that help thank you I mean it's it's a bag dice bag but sacrifices had to be made dry erase day mmm and I had 1414 purple arrow okay I was busy turning us into cat folk the rattling will go last oh nice I go hi Lena screw there the janitors of the soon what wow those are some fast ogres tonight oh they're fed after their lunch break okay so Mayo is gonna be first followed by the ogres followed by Pluto than the Tabac see then the rattling laughs after sebastian okay so are you guys gonna have big nose burst through the wall yeah okay i think that's the best way right are you guys cool with that yeah let's do it so the whole thing begins this big nose yes god and there is a crash as the wall breaks out and we will put big nose in no wow that's that's big that's big nose big nose kicks out the the wall creating a large opening in the space you can move through his square though because he is so large and so veo as he does that you are the first act I um I'm gonna cast Zephyr strike as my bonus action okay and I am going to run through his legs around the corner what what climb that yeah that corner under the bridge okay and I take I turn around and I take my longbow and I start taking shots are you gonna shoot at hi the ogres in sight I you got one of the ogres and second I take the my shots of the ogre hey bamm-bamm take my advantage for my zephyr strike 17 that is a hit the arrow so as the dust settles you burst in scurry into the room along the mine tracks and the unfired your first shot at the ogre sneak attack which is now 3 d6 as she digs in her dice bag so with my dread amber sure I got my extra d8 Mac come on one hit one hit one hit one hit 33 damn it Oh gross okay those are some low rolls damn these shot rings out in the / screams why you shoot me gosh I don't know what came over me and I take another shot 22 to hit that is also a hit and that one is 20 damage nice the ogre is still alive oh my third dread an ambush sure sure oh yeah that's 24 that is a hit the third shot rings true 19 and fell haha he collapses nice yes anyone yeah I moved behind the cart full of delirium and I whispered to the rats and I say we're here to rescue you Hey look up the the ogres howl out and say know what you do - we're gonna squish you for that bad cats and the - ogres lumber forward and the because they see where you've gone to on the other side of the cart and as they do they drag the cart behind them with them and the that ogre pushes the cart in front of him and takes it hauls it back and pushes it towards the other and it slams backward and crashes into the cart at you via Vale and I'm gonna make have him make an attack roll with the cart against you he gets a 2-1 e to hit yeah it's okay so the cart goes flying towards you and you take 20 points of bludgeoning damage and make a dexterity saving throw 17:17 okay so you can choose so you successfully save so you can choose which direction so basically here what happens the car went flying forward and these Delirium shards are flying all over it because the two carts crashed into each other but they're actually gonna continue crashing in towards the wall you can leap out of the way in whichever direction you wish go to the left yeah because and so you leap out the cart hits you but they keep going and you're able to scramble out before you get caught under the wheels of the cart the other ogre comes forward and takes a shovel and says you're ugly and goes up to big nose and takes his shovel and slams big nose in the face with it all hitting big nose and big nose takes 20 points of bludgeoning damage and big nose just his nose is now flattened injured nose at the same time cool next up is Pluto guys should I blow up the solarium I'm gonna blow up I'm gonna run up and I want to do like a power slide underneath big nose okay and then just rifle ignatius right up into this ogre nice and I go tada and I get a twenty nice that hits the ogre for fourteen damage and I'm gonna attack him again for a twenty one for sixteen damage and yeah bloodied and I'm just yeah so I'm just like so you just slide on our slide under big nose and start stabbing him in the stomach it goes wrong now what you're doing cat and it and I don't know if it looks like my claws are it's like it's just like a rapier or some don't have your weapon whatever you want it to look like they they're weapons so it looks like they're weapons yeah yeah and that's my and with that you you hear the the cat the three to back see they look at each other because they know where each of them were standing and I saw where you went and they see this other one go up and they're like imposters what's going on kill them kill them quickly and one of the the other Tabac see yells back no you fool alert the others and so one of the two back see that's on the roof he jumps down the ladder he climbs down the ladder and runs towards the mineshaft there he doesn't have a movement to make it all that way and that's it for him the other two vacci this one here it comes around the one of the ogres um and over here starts shooting the one that looks like because your ear the fat one right yeah so they're gonna attack the ones that look like them so they take out their crossbows and fire at each of you respectively because not the orange one isn't in the room yeah I'm I'm all the way back here so yep so one shot at van and bail I'm gonna give you plus two to your AC for cover behind ya but I actually get a 2500 with the first shot and a crit with the second shot okay so takes out the crossbow loads it back twice and pops off two shots at you veo and the total damage there with the bow for the critical hits is going to be [Music] it's gonna be 30 points of damage and the regular shot is only going to be eight points the two shots that they fire at you so she's like you stole my face you stole my face it's like a cat when a cat sees the reflection in the mirror they get out back here I was on and the other one fires too there are two shots at Ludo uh wow the dice were much more unfair to Aveo the two shots go completely why getting a nine and eleven once there's a big over in the way it's it's hard to hit I'm hard to hit right now that's all okay with that we go to Sebastian is there enough room and would big-nose mind if I climbed up on his back you can make in athletics check to try to climb back climb up him oh that's not gonna happen I'm not a climber okay I squeeze in between my legs okay and I'm is it as elegant as me no I like get jostled around a bit as I'm trying to weasel my way through and oh no there's so much delirium and everything around here this is okay I have a thought tell me if this would work this platform here yeah are the bars that are holding it do they look like if I I could damage them and cause the whole thing to collapse into where this ogre is absolutely okay so what a what a fire bolt do enough you would need to destroy both the pillars at the same time to get them to collapse so it's got two posts yeah so you could damage each of the posts but with one post damaged it would probably still stay standing because it's got enough it would like lop side you need to take out the second one to actually make it collapse in the way that you want to would magic missile be able to do enough you can try you can split the magic missiles up yeah okay so I hold out my staff and I'm going to aim at these two beams to try to cause this platform duel over onto the oh cool and you are casting magic missile with your staff of power yes correct okay it rolled me a wild magic surge Oh what you're standing right beside me what's Lomb and because of the influence of the Delirium i want you to roll twice and I'm gonna choose which one it is and you're gonna choose the nicest option no I'm definitely not I get sixty four okay and those of you at home can follow along with our wild magic results and 57 64 and 64 and 57 64 you cast fog cloud centered on yourself it's 57 for the next minute any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature burst into flame I know which one which one you want and both of these ones seem to be equally problematic so I'm gonna roll a d6 and on one two or three you get the flammable objects you cast fog clouds fog cloud emerges centered on yourself you want to mark it with it with the template that uses your concentration in case it's matters seeming doesn't require concentration correct no okay yep okay so that's the fog cloud the magic missiles still go off so roll them and that's 3d for is it magic missile is the staff of power and up casted magic missile let me just double check staff of power magic missile first okay so it's three shots all right and you're firing one at one pillar and to it the other yes okay so roll the two at one pillar first okay and I I'd what do I add plus one plus one to each seven damage to the one pillar okay and for damage to the other both the pillars are bloodied but they're not destroyed nuts and here creaking but not not destroyed all right oh we got [ __ ] you can't even tell cuz it's all but we got a fire going on okay yeah we order the end of the round with the rattling 's and their outlet and the right princess what is this I cannot see and so big nose swings his arms wildly Oh No fie on a one two so there's four different targets around yeah big no surrounded by uh and he cannot let me actually just don't check because does big nose get blind sight i I actually need to double check before I can he smell I don't have that memorized if he does no he doesn't he doesn't he has dark vision okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna roll ad four one two three four actually I'm gonna roll a d6 on a one at Sebastian on the two it's Pluto three four five six cuz the ogres are twice the size so his first attack hits one of the ogres and his second attack hits the same ogre so he makes both of his tax oh wait he's got three attacks all three attacks against the same just digs in once and goes goes for it he hits he hits and he hits oh my hairs into the ogre this was the one that Pluto's stabbed already I say you just hear the sound of tearing flesh and spraying blood it's all coming off cuz I'm standing right hand and foot the sound of bone being crunched on because no no no no nom nom nom no he's eating the ogre yeah above me is the ogre dead the ogre is very good yes oh that's hungry that was a disadvantage too but that ogre it's probably for the best that no one saw oh man okay and we go and then the rat prints scurries through the fog and into the room where is the Reverend where's the reference there is the rat Prince yes and yes yes yes and you just hear hear this sound of that dad died and I guess none of you can see this happen can you know okay well the rat Prince goes to town on this to vacci and it's messy and bloody and the tow and you just hear the sound of this cat screaming have you ever seen video of a rat attacking a cat it's not pretty oh when the rat fight fest the two vaccines those rules is on onslaught yep pretty shmurda it yeah he's bloody okay top of the round with Ave oh okay so I see just thought this fog cloud yep in front of me I am going to and there's no way around it can I hop over the Delirium oh yeah can I can I climb up and hop over yeah under under the crosswalk yeah yeah give me and I you have a climb speed so you don't even need to make a check so you can climb right up and you can now see above the fog cloud you can see both the Tabac see and you basically see one of the Taback see getting horrific ly mauled by the rat prince you just see the tail end of that quite literally the tail end as the reference is using both his delirium daggers and the third dagger on his tail and he's kind of like a whirlwind of teeth and claws so good brought him along and let him survive this whole time would I be a oh no that we heard one two back see running away to alarm I think I could see him yeah they oh can see him okay and that's what I'm gonna shoot at cuz I was like I wasn't sure if they are new okay I see him running away I guess I didn't know exactly what's in that because that happened before the fog cloud and I'm going to take my I'm gonna use my bonus action and I know you you're still under the effects of the Zephyr strike unless you know no okay I assume that okay are using your cross over your longbow I'm gonna take three shots with my crossbow crossbow expert yeah yes Bam Bam Bam oh 23 that's a hit so you leap up onto the platform you you see this - back see making it this orange - vacci making a run for it 17 17 damage okay takes the first shot 14 that is a miss I'm afraid the shot goes wide well in less than 14 - missed shots the two backseat urns and hisses at you I run down not down that yeah just around cuz it's 20 feet up correct it's that the crosswalk is only ten feet up but the the fog cloud goes 20 feet us fear so if I want to hide behind the fog like oh yeah and I'm like well well he's near that narrow opening where you should take took the shot exactly yeah yep okay next up is the ogres there's only one over left alive and he's just gonna take a wild swing is two attacks and I think that there's both a polio and Sebastian they have the round and big nose and okay so I got a rollback see so there's a Taback see all all in his visit to back see an ogre Pluto Sebastian a big nose is kind of back there big nose is back there yeah so it's Sebastian pollute OH - back see and reference okay so for so I'll I'm just gonna roll OD 4 1 2 3 4 wrap Prince for for the other it's Pluto makes his attacks with this advantage swinging him it first goes from a 19 to a - I appreciate that whoa a second is a crit that turns into a 24 the 24 definitely hits okay the ogre ow bashes into you this shovel hits you with a loud boom I just get shoveled yeah you got shovel is this the old man from my home alone and that's gonna be 15 points a bludgeoning damage Wow and you were pushed back five feet into me hey hi Pluto it is your turn okay I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get out of this fog cloud I need to get eyes on the prize okay so I'm gonna try to book it towards where I remember the mineshaft was before the fog lab we're not cool so it takes you 10 feet of movement to get out and then you see the two Tabac see outside the cloud of fog ones right beside you with with its crossbow the other is just got you just as you come out of the fog you see the bolt from Aveo you hit the one and it cry out and it's running to this big fat orange - vacci is running towards the the shaft exit so and I'm do I take any opportunity from the ogre no cuz he can't see you okay so as soon as I come out there's one two back see right yeah and I'm gonna see you see both of them I'm gonna swing at the one getting a twenty five that is a hit for 11 damage and is this the one that the reference was mulling no the the one that the I Prince mauling is is in the fog so I swing at him and then oh dude what I'd do it yeah I ain't a swing at him again I 18 to hit also a hit for not as good 10 damage okay two swings crash crash slice slice and I'm just gonna I'm kind of preoccupied with him I'm gonna use I'm going to bonus action misty step in front of other one okay and I'm just gonna try to block the door nice okay so you interpose yourself okay the tabac see from the ring of spells storing the two vacci turned to each other and say we're under attack we need to warn we need to warn the others and the two of them lower their the one that's right in front drops the crossbow and take and comes at you with with his claws hello probably strength e'er than me getting a 21-2 hit oh that's a hit it's a hit big guy for Wow eight points of damage the other fires to crossbow shots that you pollute Oh getting a 21 and a 14 hits so the 21 for her sure hit okay and that is gonna be a total of 17 points of damage yikes okay I'm in front across both shots juju and that is I catch one that shot across was gonna run up onto the platform up here yeah yep and we go to Sebastian reveals the last two vaccine is gonna disengage and run out of the fog back towards the restaurant and just like flying all the way it's like the smoke cloud in an ACME cartoon as Sylvester is trying to run yeah so what he's like here because he's getting mauled by a rat Prince okay so the first thing that Sebastian does is he puts on his goggles and he evades his true seeing so that he can see in the fog cloud and the fog cloud centered on me right can true seen crusing cannot penetrate nowak so yeah because it's it's it's not not like it is magic but it's still fog and true seeing allows you to see through illusions magical darkness it's weird it's the one thing true seeing magical it's magical fog yeah physical materials yeah right it's that's obscuring your science yeah well then I no need to just quickly read something cuz like you know if you conjured a wall of fire that blocks line-of-sight you couldn't true see through the wall afire exactly but you could just spell it like magic yeah like that's how you would deal with it yeah yeah zap I mean technically nothing about it nothing about this requires you to continue concentrating on it the [ __ ] how long does it last for from as long as he concentrates on well then I'm not gonna concentrate on I it kind of just happened and I guess I concentrated on it by accident and now I'm like wait why am I thinking about this fog cloud are you yeah does it just last for like a minute oh wait no if it if it normally requires concentration it doesn't and it lasts for its full duration yeah so it doesn't require yeah so just yeah I realize no that you you have to be able to okay well either way the spell that I'm gonna cast doesn't require line-of-sight so Sebastian kind of moves around the ogre he can kind of sense that there's all this backing going so he moves around the ogre and he's going to use lightning bolt also from the staff of power I mean you I guess you could argue that I couldn't read a scroll right now right he doesn't care about these magic searches I mean I was I was gonna use a scroll but fog cloud is apparently messing up all my stuff yeah yeah all right go for it yeah sure you don't want me to read a scroll up are you sure you you could you just have to walk out of the fog lab no I don't get my line that way this is my line all right Church roll twice let's find out what what it is gonna be we really really tempting fate right now that's a great drawback for the staff 11 that's actually yeah it's actually really good and 36 potted plant potted plant rola d-10 your age changes a number of years equal to the role or your height changes 9 okay so you should why 9 inches okay I got a little bit shorter I point the staff towards so like in the fog I can see glimpses of this big ogre and I can hear the commotion near where Pluto is and I'm like Pluto watch out and I blast and this beam of lightning smashes through out of the fog cloud from the staff and it hits ya - of the Taback sees and the ogre okay the ogre fails the saving throw and the middle to vacci succeeds it's saving throat and the last two vacci wow they all the ogre fails but both the types of actually actually make the saving throw down question is it that your actual height changes or your illusion hi chips my actual height changes my illusion stays the same he's not even notice for the illusion so bigger all of a sudden I'm gonna use a point to re-roll a few of those days do you well that's all better just tempting fate with this Wild Magic I love it I love wild magic I'm a big fan it's never steered me wrong or it's actually it always gives more than 35 35 damage haha the ogre hasn't taken any yet and both the tabacky are bloodied hahaha good job as they are fried and all the cat fur is standing on I look at them and I'm like I know what that's like that's happened to me before the rattling 'he's okay so the rat prince rushes out from the fog cloud towards his prey and just it is like the surging spinning attack of he's spinning with the tail and the tail comes around basically stabs in the back and the tail comes around stabs in the front and lifts the Taback see up and throws it to the ground and the Radford's like yes yes yes the two maxi is killed by the rat prince and the ogre has to roll randomly cuz he's still in the fog cloud so there's polute Oh in there oh it's Joe it's just a Sebastian and big nose if big nose is even a target or it might just be me yeah so my so one two Sebastian it's Sebastian yeah yeah cuz you're also where the lightning bolt came from so he's gonna make a Spanish turning a crit into an eight and getting a 13 versus AC nope all right winger smashes down I behind those barrels and boxes yeah it's delirium in the boxes please police say no please yeah bits of delirium shatter everything yeah as the boxes are smashed your lucky is smash isn't magical some of them go into big noses mouths he gets bigger he grows nine inches stolen oh yeah and actually sir no I totally messed up so it's not the ogres turn it's big noses turn so oh he knows smashes at the ogre oh wow yeah so big nose almost rolled two crits but they turned into not crits with this advantage your dice are too on fire right now that yeah these are good ones love these big nose tears the ogre apart yeah fortunately we didn't get on the wrong turn I was like oh yeah so they're both destroyed by that nice Oh the ogre is my bad I totally skipped a bunch of people's turns okay so that's the rattling z' now back to the top with Vale all right I come back into line of sight or that big you know what I'm actually can I see the tip back see that's on the platform yes yeah you can see both whoo all right and some weakened beans just saying just saying my weak and some being symmetric rattling I have that sort of that's what the worst thing I'm gonna shoot at the Tabac seat on I'm like Pluto's got the other guy on on the end in the back should have been Roswell is tied to a chair 22 and it's right this is against the one on the platform okay nineteen damage I think that's it for her yes wait what yeah but what color do vacci was that did I felt that was the yourself oh yeah the rat the rat Prince destroyed the one that was looking like pollute oh yeah and then I turned my gaze to the one that's uh across from Pluto nope okay fourteen that's miss two shots hit it one shot hits takes out the the gray of the Cal cotopaxi who falls off the platform and the rattling is nearby start eating it hurts a little bit I'm like and cackles at that I can't remember that I'm a cat do you think and so we have veiled the ogres are all destroyed so we go to Pluto so I'm just I'm he clawed me and it hurt and I claw him with my sword with the 25 for 14 damage and then I clumb again for a crit 24 damage what happens so he claws me and I catch like a couple bolts from the shields from the other one and I just I just hacked off one of his legs and then I come up and I just decapitate it and I go no other weak points are the head severs between the space you see they are standing there with like a tear in her eye I didn't know those already with that the rat Prince fouls out it says the time has come brothers yes yes yes yes yes we are free we are free we will all rise up and eat all the manlings up above eat the cats eat the big big manlings eat the little manlings eat them all break the chains yes yes yes hail the rat guard we're friends el borracho teller I got oh yes these three that look like the cats that you weren't beating you up they tricksters they spirits send by the rack God they in bodies of humans but they did big trick rock god trick everybody yes yes yes and the right Prince Lucy that very good yes big dogs you have fun big noses just like chomping on one of the ogre I was wrong I'm gonna taste good meat I say that we let them like we just we just go for it now like we leave and let them continue you destroy so the elevator is up yeah do you want me to go get the move the little rod and climb back down I think so I think we let the rattling snow like so we turn to the rattling x' we're going to open up the elevator and more of these Tabac see and ogres may come but I trust that with your great force you will overcome them big nose traits see me flesh and blood eat them yes for dinner and all the rattling scope yeah we have to eat yes lottery yes yes we eats them sssss do they like swarm in through the hole and like just start to like cover the ground the little rats yeah oh I'm also gonna start scooping up some Delirium for Vale oh yeah yeah do we want a how much delirium can we find before we go up the as you go to grab grab some of it the reference goes oh yes yes yes and the reference grabs a piece and says to the other rat links you eat yes you eat it makes you strong yes yes yes it makes you strong quick put it in the bag of holding I start like holding I shove it yeah I know that you're putting that in the bag of holding yeah but there's so much delirium in here yeah in this room so we're sharing it some may get some we get something one for you one for me yeah you have to learn yeah you're able to harvest Atlee at least four large crystals and just floating loosely around are another six fragments yep how're you guys doing for health fair how did you well I need should we take a potion I'm definitely gonna take greater you do you have a superior did you know he did it one foot but I'm gonna take him I'm also gonna have there is there any ill effects from taking two potions of healing is it only when you mix only when you mix guys you can you can knock back to I was just to graders give me 42 graders would be 40 yet that's what I'm doing BAM why are you smiling why do I use like why are you smiling over there all these rats are eating bill they are they growing as well are they like yeah it's it's disgusting okay guys let's get out of here we've probably should have left a while ago huh let's let's let's leave okay upwards yes he's yes upwards forward Jesus how we get out from here we want more yes yes oh yeah let me go grab the elevator and just remember that I mean should we go up first we should probably go up first and then like the other it come down for you to free the other rat links and I kind of explained the other levels of where the other rattling Tsar in the cages and it's very confusing cave if not well laid out there's definitely a lot of tunnels where screeches when you need them oh yes we take tile tunnels and the rat prince comes to the others and says you all Dean yes yes yes why are you using all those sticks why are you using those strange takes you take that or with your hands and he starts telling the rattling stick to whiten why I like start digging at the hole that you've already broken into and digging they get on the platform and start digging and upward it's going hole they're not digging that fast but it's a rattling scenario the reference doesn't have the same tunnel planning and scratches so I'm gonna go up the walls grab my a movable rod and then come back down and hope that they're gonna try to lower it down to us should we yell oh yeah I see yeah you're like you're out the back seats right now yeah you're all disguised yeah so what if we like sound the alarm or yes so you yell out and you hear the man the man say the man from a hook everything all right down there there's a revolt what get us out of here the ratleys are attacking you yes there's so many of them yeah thank you you hearing my voice yeah yell up I'm at a boxer Oh black I'm sorry but you know what the protocol is that if the rattling is repelled down there I hope you had a good life pull me up we can climb the walls gay week I can't um ready start trying to climb the walls do all my crap wait wait hold on it--so so the wind starts going up and say if you survive down there will when we have the time we'll burn your bodies don't worry vo claw your eyes out if you don't lower that thing down Wow they are tossed me the grapples shot I toss it to you and I'm gonna fly mning up the walls and I'm gonna shoot the gravel shot and I just grabs gently hang on okay I don't know if you came alright um make an attack roll with the grapple shot can I add anything adjust your proficiency modifier in dexterity 18 you hit with the grapple shot and it leaves as it tries to pull you you both up this might be more than it can handle if you want to keep going I'm gonna roll a d6 and it might break the grapple shot after this you don't get in my bag of holding I've got you and I go up and jump in the bag of holding zip and you're on you're on the elevator and it heaves a crash and the man with the with the mask looks what are you doing this isn't protocol you're supposed to just stay there and die if the rattling start attacking you back I choose life I also agree we're not all the way up yet no you're not I say somebody should die you're right and I go to push him off the edge okay make a let extrac mine I get a seven so and he fails his dexterity saving throw so you leap up onto the elevator shove the man off and he falls into a pool of rats into a pool of rats who begin devouring him and there's just like the skeletal remains it's very fast as the rallies of Irish and the winch though the winch raises back up as the elevator comes in into place and the hewing yeah so it just killed oboe he tried to kill us fair enough yeah I mean to be honest I would have done the same what's going on down there I crawl out of a bag the rats are revolting we had to get out of there clearly well this is a disaster we got to let the Queen know right away absolutely we'll let her know you should probably set the bonfire just like I know that's usually the plan we've got some up the way up by the docks we've got some barrels of oil we're gonna dump it down there smoke them out we get a good smoke going should kill them all awesome but let's go to the queen of thieves we need to let her know you start the fire smoke oil thing he can tell us bring it yeah we're gonna go to the Queen together all right well he points and said it says you can take it to the green ah black you're the foreman for your level you should you should go but you to stay here with me will stabilize the situation I'll block you go on your own which one of you is the orange one I'll block you you go on your own up to the Queen let her know as quickly as possible you to stay down here with me these two are injured they need healing I need to bring them with me now I'm hurt as the foreman of my love oh these two need to get out of here you can handle this yeah handle some rattling 'z can't you well I mean the others down there are gonna be really pissed I'll feel is that we can just make a persuasion check fourteen well you know find a look at you to be points to the the ogres get the barricades down here get this last shipment going and let's get it off to the docks I make the own or goes do the work we're guards not grunts yeah right all right yeah all right guys I imagine it would be pretty scary down there that's terrifying are the rats coming up the shaft at all or are they just kind of chillin down there they couldn't climb all day they are climbing each other Tower oh that's a lot of looks down there that's a lot of rattling yeah I don't know where they came from that's more than what was down there wasn't it are the ogres gone they got through a Kraken no the Silph there's four ogres and there's three human men in here and they're like in this room so you're in the room at the top of the of the mineshaft okay right there's the big heart that two of the ogres are loading with a delirium from the elevator and the two ogres that work the winch and then there's the to human Foreman and then the cart driver is while on the horses yeah we're gonna go see the Queen yes just before I leave I'm like I just wanted to have one more look then and I look over and I'm actually going to just quickly cast mold earth onto the wall next to where all the rats are gathering and it just says screeches so that they know that he's the one that can read and it says revolt get in position criticism with the group it's just the rat Prince oh yeah well then nobody can read it so never mind my plans they'll figure it out rap Prince knows the plan right for the most part okay let's steal all the manlings that's the plan yeah and the cat thing um let's go to the queen of Thieves done in an image as you as you exit the doors you there's another one a man rushes down the stairs you're in this longer hallway and another and bumps into the group of you whoa get out of the way yo hey it's blackjack what are you what's going on down here I'm supposed to warn everyone the hooded lanterns there in the area they're attacking us they're gonna kill us all now I mean round oh you know we have a rattling problem down here the rats are revolting this is a nightmare we gotta get to the Queen we do she'll know what to do lead the way ah I can't believe this this is insane ah black right forming from down in the mines yes oh man hmm this is just a crazy situation I mean I was betting on it happening eventually so everybody so you know a few others are gonna owe me a considerable amount of money because I said that you know the rat of Radford rebellion was absolutely inevitable at some point but the fact that it happening at the same time as the hood or lanterns attacking very suspicious feels so suspicious all you need to let the queen of thieves know now alright let's come with me say meow Wow so you're in these hallways looks like a small barracks has been set up in several the the hallway here has a set of stairs leading up and there's a large room at the end of the hallway with several bunk beds and training dummies and even like practice chests for the thieves to practice picking locks there's a few kitchens and supplies and other provisions up here and blackjack Mel Mel says alright so come well well let's get to the Queen real quick it's this is gonna be a real terrible situation but she always has a plan she always knows what to do I have an idea blackjack Mel do you want to be a hero no we're not particularly okay do you want to get credit for being a hero no not really at all okay I just want to live in fact to be perfectly honest I'm gonna take you to the Queen and I'm gonna get out of here completely and entirely because to me it's you know I've been on the Queen of themes but I'm not gonna bet my life on it that's a great idea but let me tell you I want to raise in the ranks here and there's one way that I know to do that I say we blow up all the rattling 'he's the queen of thieves she mentioned that she had a bomb do you know about it I heard it through the grapevine I've heard it through the grapevine have you there's been whispers meow you know about the Queen's bomb yeah do you really trust the Queen's that all of the Queen's men to keep things like that a secret it's trickled down you've heard about it people talk here blunts true I like you logic I would bet on it all right maybe she can use them to blow those rats sky-high I'll bet that's her endgame and the hood of legends are doing at the same time kill two birds with one stone it's perfect now what if we set the bomb then we would be heroes No then you'd be dead dead heroes we were too back see we can run faster than the bomb now well I heard that the errant ones that were in charge of that thing were the queen of Thieves and she was only given that to lies deceit and Ryan Ryan well then we'll just have to talk to them yeah are they it was lies deceit and Ryan to head it when they you know pulled the whole thing over at the Cathedral and God stuff I heard about that yeah it was those idiots over there in the cathedral eh yeah now they were waiting right there underneath the sewers although people say bomb wasn't even there classic queen of Thieves I say is like I grit my teeth classic so good mom wasn't even there she totally walked over all those idiots I mean they were impressive gladiators and everything like that but like totally played them like a fiddle it was beautiful weren't they the ones that were what blood blood barbecue yeah they were good I was representing that I was their manager for a little while and I wonder you know so you're fond to those jerks saying yeah they're jerks but I like them well they probably like you because you're a stand up underhanded yeah shame the queen of the the the queen of Thieves said that they're supposed to that you know they might have to die but it's all right yeah well I might well she put out a hit on the cat only the cat you know know there was she said kill the cat kill the big guy bring the orange hair one back to her I think he's he's the he's the magical one I hear take a little take a little bit of a thought being a two to bat see but I wonder what she wants with him beats me well he was the handsome one in the group let's go to the queen of Thieves right Sebastian oh yeah can you put on your goggles before we visit the Queen yes thank you keep it them on right now how long does it last I believe ten minutes can you get some more the ones I have three oh yeah I was thinking of using it once we're near yeah as soon as we get close yeah okay black dress drag Rimmel bring us to the Queen or no lies and deceit Ozzy the green let's just go straight to the Queen let's go to the Queen all right so it's right this way you head up the stairs and the the the set of stairs head up spiral up a few more times and eventually connect back to the halls where the queen of thieves arena is you're familiar with the these areas it see the the prison complex that you are in connects just off of here so from that prison complex leads to the arena's and the other other chambers you pass through several rooms of various bunks and that have bunk beds kitchens and a few common areas where various members of the Queen's men are all starting to run around and there's various states of individuals as you pass them or some of them are like we got to just get out of here right and there's a group of them that say there's there's a sewer passage down up in the prison cells let's get out of there and get out as quickly as we possibly can something about and as you pass by black check mail says we'd better tell everybody as we pass up that there's rad folk coming up from from the mine so they can figure out the best way to get out of here there's lots of secret ways ways out and there's at least three sewer passages that we can take to get well away where this whole place I think the best bet is for everybody to take the sewer passages totally totally agree if we got to get out of here that's what the Queen says we better go tell her who it's quickly as possible you head up to the he opens another set of doors that lead from what looks like a large gambling hall and parlor underneath underground gambling hall and that is connected also to the sewers itself and it leads through a set of doors into the queen of Thieves massive arena from the in in the room there is a massive gambling hall that's been set up underground in what looks like to be a converted part of the sewers that has been built out or what might have been the remains of several basements all kind of clamor together the architecture is hodgepodge spanning a bit of sewer architecture former basements the foundations of what might have even been like a castle like it's really hard to pin exactly all the architecture that has happened down here but it opens up into this massive gambling hall that has tables were where Queen's men are playing dice cards and other various games and there's actually several kegs where they're all pouring themselves ale and sharing wine and pouring various spirits there's even a make sure there's a makeshift distiller where they're making their own moonshine and potato whiskey there's a few people that are singing and playing instruments and as the Oh crashes open through the doors blackjack mallow cries out everybody everybody does it attack gets your own safe places we'll reconvene shortly very sorry all the bets are nullified losers take your stuff get out here as quickly as you possibly can head to the sewers and he leads you through the casino to the a pair of sealed iron bound doors which has a switch beside them says supposed to knock once if it's an emergency can i before he does that I want to cast from the helm of telepathy the tech thoughts on blackjack mill at DC thirteen wisdom my Ranger danger sense is tingling [Music] you cast detect the thoughts on blackjack not only is he screwing us and you can't read his thoughts I read your danger senses yelling

with a shook of white through the front of it she is wearing leather armor underneath and as blackjack Mel looks at you as this woman looks looks at you she's unmistakable in her identity it's CAD what do you see Sebastian I can't read his thoughts it's not I don't know what who this is yeah you're a cat you know he's a cat she's a cat this is true what's talking about cat got your tongue I stopped I stopped running I hold my tongue like I stand I stop right I stand you know don't you what you're talking about I know we gotta warn the queen of thieves and get out of here as quickly as you possibly can come on straight through this door the Kree nathie has already knows I'm gonna walk up to blackjack Mel and try to grab his arm you grab it and it does not feel like a he's a scrawny man but it feels no it feels fine until it shifts underneath underneath into the face of Cora the familiar form of the queen of these is taken oh I'm so sorry boys girls welcome back here we are again thanks for the warning by the way I dismiss seaming I see you can't we talk face-to-face step into my office I'm shaking my head I I ignore fail and Pluto she opens that opens the door up I look at

to you Ignatius would know do you want me dead is that what you want do you know how I've tried I've tried to find a way to fix all this why are you talking to her like that she's the enemy we came here to kill her she changes her form to that of cat so that the other two can see he thinks I'm one of his old friends what do you mean things who who is this who are you it's Kat Von castle von Kessel what fun castle or not does not excuse what she is done daughter of the Queen and one of my closest friends when I was younger yeah Vale shifts the form you haven't seen Katerina von Kessel since she was yeah like in 15 years but it's definitely you recognize her I recognize her but it makes me more angry I'm like fuming right now I'm like are you gonna let this form this particular face stop our plans Sebastian is she tricking you the true sight the cockles that's her that's you it's still another face another face for the Queen did manipulate us and trick us it doesn't matter if it's her real face or not it's not the queen of Fuso anymore it's Kat they're one in the same Sebastian I'm so sorry for what I did yeah that's not gonna be good enough not for a long time at least I'm working on it I'm gonna get her back so am I then we'll do it together yeah we will but on my terms now you've created a little bit of a situation here I have to admit I had no idea you were working with the rattling z' I do have a few tricks up my sleeve still even I wouldn't have done something so reckless and chaotic you know me if you think you can can you think you can control them no not anymore no you can only control them as long as they're in changed in cages and even then and now we've got enemies coming at us from all sides you sure do so do you still want to make a difference yes well we've got an army it's marching on the city and an empty throne and seven and six of the badges that we need help me take my throne you can't watch me do it I can it's mine it's not yours it never was who says it's not mine for laws who makes those laws what are you gonna be the queen of the Queen's men bound rules and renegades of the streets what are you gonna rule over you're an aspiring mage I'm going to rule over Westham are it's mine this is my home and I'm gonna make it a better place and a better place for people like us to Sebastian that's my goal too and you really think the Academy and the church really care the Academy is gonna give me the resources I need to make this place better you're just ruling over the rabble of the streets I was they belong we almost have everything we need and yet here I am with my friends and my forces your men are being devoured by rats and killed on the streets and they'll make it out some of them the good ones well to a few and we'll still be able to get to the castle we'll still be able to get to the throne and we'll still be able to move forward if you haven't totally botched the situation by riling up the rattling it's under control those things are way beyond your control now if we're lucky the silver order will burn the city to the ground and topple the tower of the amethyst academy and kill everyone inside it and then there will be no record left that said catarina vaughn castle was mage born what happened to you we were friends you were we are and we still can be but we've got some work to do Sebastian and if you don't want to do this then hey she's playing tricks on you man what what are you playing at I thought we had a mission operation may have you listed it out you told us what to do are you bailing on us now are you abandoning us there's a list I have to fix this I have to fix what I did wrong we will fix it this is some scoundrel you have no claim to the throne you're not royalty you're a powerful enemy but you're not who is she I told you about the girl I sent to hell that was her sister that was an accident there was a mistake that was the mistake I made and then you left I never saw you again now here you are she's not the cat you know no but this is my fault I created this by my mistake she's toying with you Sebastian you may have made a mistake she makes her own choices she set her own destiny you don't owe her for the mistakes that she's made I owe her fixing the mistake that I made which can happen but it doesn't mean giving everything to her and abandoning us since that day I promised that I would find Mouse bring her back and if I ever saw cat again it would be with Mouse but here I am still empty-handed we can we can get her you can save her I know I know there's a way but we need to get in the castle to do it you have need the power of the city to do it well why would you tell me this now you've you've there was a kill order out for it my friends you threatened me you have done everything in your power to make everything more difficult why didn't you just tell me who you were we could have been working together this whole time we could have we could have made things better together you wanna watch Sebastian you don't make anything better you make everything worse that's not true you're right it's not true this city is better because Sebastian has been here it was an accident it was an accident it was a mistake Thank You Vale welcome we got your back you got ours look Sebastian there's a lot of blood on my hands and if you're gonna let her unravel everything that we've tried to incompass just because she claims to be some person you knew before the meteor fell the same person that you've changed from that was that was a lifetime ago let go become you're holding the staff of power you are a hero you're the Archmage of the amethyst academy and we're running out of time I can get Mouse back I know I can and I know that when I do she would be ashamed of what you've become you're a monster you're not the person that I knew when I was young no she was kind I'm not it was my fault too what happened to Mouse I act you on and I want to make right fur - I should have known and I guess I should have known again that you just keep being a slow-motion disaster so you've got enough mistakes to make up for and I'm offering you one last chance a way out don't talk to me like you know everything that I've been through you witnessed one of my mistakes in person have you ever accounted for the things that I've done to try to help people the amount of times them the lifetime that I've spent trying to save Mouse I made some mistakes and I've been trying to fix them you you've become the biggest scourge that I have seen on this city worse than the haze worse than the delirium worse than the rattling x' you are a deceiver you're a liar you are a trickster you have deceived an entire group of people who don't know any better convince them that this is the life that they need and for what just so that you can sit in a throne a throne of lies and deceit ruling over a kingdom of nothing of rubble and thieves I'm giving you this one chance step down we could still make this place better let the armies out there do what they will Sebastian I can make this place better but you can't and that's we're going to
