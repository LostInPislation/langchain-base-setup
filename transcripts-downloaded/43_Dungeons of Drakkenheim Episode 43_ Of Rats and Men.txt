Ahmed wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered fifteen years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway condom its rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] and we are back to the ruins of Drakon Heim when last we left our heroes they had had a bitter confrontation and a fatal duel with night captain Theodore marshal and pollute Oh Jackson slew him after which they basically burned down about 30 soldiers of the silver order they wanted to die at that point I gave them so many opportunities oh this will bode for the ongoing and escalating situation in Drakon time in Drakon Heim only time will tell but our heroes were able to plunder the ruins of the old common Hall the Town Hall of Drakon Heim were the administrative buildings and the mayor the Lord Mayor's offices were there they found the circlet of the Lord Mayor one of the badges of Drakon Heim as well as plundered the city archives for the old maps and schematics of Drakon Heim sewer system revealing the various connections that sprawl underneath the city this information in tow they ever turned to the Clocktower with Jupiter Jones and handsome and several soldiers of the hooded lanterns to recuperate and plan their next move what will you do so I'm feeding my pigeons upstairs while we discuss this cause poor guys haven't gotten some feed in a while it's nice to be out of the haze for a little bit yeah just to be above the haze smell it breathe that air reading my mum's spell book trying to find some more stuff I really want to go back to the amethyst Academy tower so I can you know talk to her again yeah I guess I could do that anywhere can you strictly speaking yeah yes you could perform the ritual anywhere ah it's been how long has it been since we did it yeah we'll do it tomorrow yeah that's what you always say when you call your mom I'll just do it it's like just do it man just get it out of the way don't it's not something that needs to be gotten out of the way it's something that I need to take time I think about what I want to say to my mother you know we don't talk that often that's fair is it cuz she's dead that's that's the main reason yeah yeah that'll do it she's I'm sure this last time you wrote her she knows I'm happy we have a we have an understanding so what's our next course of action guys well like we said before I think the badges are the most important thing and so far we've got a few of them got yours ding Academy Academy the circlet yes do we have any others is it just the two I think uh it's just the two right now but how many are there in total there's Lord commanders which the queen of fees has um there's the one at Saint Salinas that we well we don't know if that's a Salinas but the last time we knew it was a Zetas um is the Cathedral a high flame keeper queen of thieves has Queen has uh the grand Gil guild hall [Music] Guildmaster had won the assembly chambers which we just did really working yep good know as the all my father's which the Queen the Queen a few tries so she's got three right now and where you have two and there's three of what we know of we don't know if she's been looking around the rest of this yeah yeah right [Music] so there's three that she has two that we have and possibly two unknowns although Jupiter Jones if you recall did find out about the Lord Mayor's from investigating the Grand guild hall which he had said had been plundered so yeah and st. Selena's Abbey is the stronghold of the followers of the following fire yes so I'm assuming that means that the queen of Thieves possibly has four I hope for isn't enough to control a giant robot in the middle of the city because that would be a bad thing the would but it at least it can't really climb always have up to our advantage um but I think we know we're up to four of them are right now yeah we kind of have them all gathered in one spot and I think it was all part of the plan we just yet let our enemy collect all the badges so that it's easier for us and we have to kill one person instead of four right I'm a scary person one very dinosaur is your highness she one of us am I the queen of Thieves why would you say that I'm just kidding what something you know about me that the queen with these wouldn't know about me you have a birthmark under your sixth nipple okay you're Sebastian he knows you know we can always test with Ignatius oh well is he is he I know we're kind of in a fight right now but I feel like when the time is right he won't let me down and I'm gonna wait until that moment to find out can you try to find out right now like this is Ignatius doing anything Ignatius and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna say Ignatius but in like a very like Ignatius I try to coax them out the the sword you can lift the sword and carry it but to coax the flames from the blade you cannot you're gonna have to do something like super heroic to earn him back not just heroic but like righteously for the flame for the flame of the flame can I reverse killing no we'll kill the queen of Thieves we'll get the thingy from the high flame keeper back we'll go light the fires at the cathedral and then we will be the new religious order in Drakon high yeah I don't know about religious order we'd be uh order maybe we do maybe we maybe we cleanse the but for today we need to we need to plan against the queen of Thieves okay well get on Ignatius is good side later we got schematics for the sewers right we do and it just so happens that I recall an entrance into the queen of Thieves lair Azeris Joe you can wield Ignatius during this period but the flames will not function for currently okay right I will but I will find a way to win him back regularly other thing that may be of interest to you is that you are able to identify that the powers of the Lord Mayor's circle it functions as a helm of telepathy there's a requirement it does and so I'm sorry I must get these ones mixed up it is it does not function as a hell of telepathy it functions as a medallion of thoughts and so it has three charges and while wearing it you can use an action to expend one charge to cast detect thoughts from it and it regains one D three expended charges daily at dawn anybody have room I can't have one cuz you because I am the Lord Commander and I can only wield the Lord commanders that what about nobody ever gave me restrictions as an arch me yeah is this a restriction that they put on you like one of those like you shouldn't have this much power but then we just kind of give it to you anyway so this city should not and I mean I'm new to this job so I don't want to get in trouble right off the bat you want to wait for your first 90 days double mistake it it is it is a hell of telepathy not a medallion of thoughts they're just they both cast detect thoughts it's just that the hello telepathy also has the ability to send telepathic messages and when you when you are focusing on a creature with detect thoughts you can send a suggestion at them as well I Hawk Ignatius off of the river no no no no so I as part of my role I cannot have and I will stand by that because you know I want to do a good job I mean I could drop the pearl of power and nobody put any restrictions on me that I know of to not wear a bunch of badges a bunch of badges I just give you like a look like nobody told me not to and until it's better to ask forgiveness what if we gave it what if we gave it to Jupiter I don't want busy partying I'm reading our thumb we uh we like yeah and some like maybe we can can we can we as an extension of those requirements it cannot be given to a member of the hooded lanterns or anyone under Bao's direct command right we're all em right no you're going I think you know what Jupiter's not a bad idea if you can't take it Pluto I could drop either my ring wait wait wait wait or the pair of the amulet of wound closure yeah as much as I as much as I trust Jupiter sometimes on occasion we're giving him a badge and having him like we're gonna be parting ways with him soon yeah do you think Pluto you would get more value out of being telepathic than you would do I'm not guys oh the spells I love the spells though or or not dying you know man can always tell you I love not dying to you so money especially if we're gonna take on the Queen I mean do we need to use it can't we just like hang on to it okay hang on to it and we'll we'll figure it out this way well we need to take an hour at least right yeah to into it to use it I am as a Caspian brother Jupiter has proven himself time and time again don't give him a batch of the city he's a loyal comrade given the other given the the non dying one what's that very apt yeah and I mean it doesn't actually like not make me die just helps with my death saves but if if if worse comes to worse you guys you guys will save me right yeah really I'll cast I'm fast I can save you fast I Huck the amulet grab the chain fella so you are gonna wear the helmet allopathy okay and I now is it is it imposing can I wear my regular helmet over topic is functions a hell as a homily but the Lord Mayor's circle it it is a simple silver circle it that is that can be worn underneath your helmet can I wear it on my arm because my muscles are so yes but you would need to wear it on your head to focus its power yeah I guess that's other people's thoughts right into your brain mind Wow okay that's the sound that I want you to make every time you use it I'll hang onto the wound closure thing okay and all I will attune to the circlet of telepathy so we're going after the Queen we need a guide for the series wait a map now well true okay we need a infiltration army we do we need more people I still like our idea of having a ground assault so what is your plan exactly the plan and you guys can work with me on this a plan that I remember yeah is we are going to have the hooded lanterns and the Caspian draw the Queen's men out on the surface not engaging in like huge open combat but draw them out and start picking them off to like make a commotion upstairs you totally have a tournament sure okay whatever whatever draws people out of the Queen's hideout then we go in with the right wings through the sewers and we send them in to cause mayhem from the underside and during all this mayhem we find our way to the Queen and assassinators because it's going to be that easy we walk in we kill air we walk out yeah totally to consider t-rex maybe in the meantime and also find a defuse a bomb or find and obtain a bomb that's been stolen forever know if she would well she might bomb something else for it if she's desperate enough she could blow up many things and I just need that bomb so I can tell you a few things about the maps that you found they show the main positions of the central sewer lines so the main sewer system extends out from carries collects through the industrial district and a main line runs under champions way and then that line actually then veers to the west where it deposits most of the sewage and the waste from the south part of the city into the drain River about where Styx's Ferry is and from there there is another secondary line that runs parallel to champions way from the north to the south but this line looking at the maps and looking at what you know about Drakon hime this line of the sewer has likely been cut like runs underneath where the crater is now crushed although it would continue forward from there conceivably depending on no one's surveyed the crater and no one knows the damage so it's entirely possible that the parts of the sewer could be could have been exposed and open to the crater itself depending on what is still surviving in that area although it has been 15 years and probably some of those holes closed up you also know that from looking at the maps and what you remember of when you were at buckle down row one of the smaller sewer lines run buckle down row and you can very quickly identify the area where there was that cistern where you fought those crocodiles and figure out oh yeah this is approximately where that is and you can see that there's other connections of another large sewage shaft that you remember from when you were in the Queen's dungeon when we're trying to escape yeah and we found that him and we saw that look Cole and I crawled in and then it was like well this goes on for awhile and I crawled back out well that cavern is not marked on the map but the actual shaft is there is marked there so you can see how from these maps how these all connect together and based on what you know the buckle down row basically connects to the main sewage line the only other lines leading into that are the ones that come from the crater itself so it's either the bucket goes right out buckle down row champions way out to the the river or this other line that connects from from the craters going in so if you wanted it so aside from that there are other entrance points you could probably find other entry ways into kind of the peripheral smaller tunnels but these would be ones where you could even be crawling on your hands and knees down these smaller lines because that part of the city the the spokes doesn't it has the least well-developed sewer of the rest of track and I'm I just got this new coat presses agitation and we're gonna go down in the sewer okay let's make it dirty do you guys now you're okay we go in this arena fine do you guys have anything that you want to add or change about plan I'm gonna call it operation mayhem well the the main question I want to change the name was the weather you wanted to try to seek out those caverns whether you wanted to go in from the the shaft or the cistern right so there's this where you originally went trying to find the queen of his stronghold so you could go that way you could use the maps to get make your way to the cistern which leads to the queen of Thieves dungeons but that goes through the sewer or you could try and find where that cavern is that connects to the dungeon as well but that's not on the maps and where that would lead out from and where that would lead to is completely on is is not known and then if you did want to go towards where buckle down row is you might also want to consider whether you want to approach from somewhere else in the city or from from the the river exit or from below champions way like wit where you want to come from as well navigator also looking looking at this the sewers potentially offer the queen of Thieves considerable avenues of escape so if we are bringing the rattling sand it might be cool to bring a small band with us up to cause some stuff but leave most of them down there to block exit so we we could actually go to the rattling show them the map they know the sewers they've been hanging out in there so we could get them to like group up at all the exits from buckle down row and kill anybody who isn't one of us I'm just saying if the Queen really wants to get out do you think she won't be able to do something tis imrat wings I'm hoping for an overwhelming number and she wouldn't expect to run into them and her escape routes yeah true true like if you're running through the sewers and 18 rattling jump on you and start shanking you it's it's gonna be a tough time and at least like we if hopefully we would be able to chase her and the rattling x' will at least slow her down or maybe tell us where she's going maybe we can get them to keep like follow her if she gets away or whoever gets away maybe we can lure into some kind of trap like I like the idea of like Rawlings to jumper or like lure her true like a gelatinous cube this is why like with the rattling xin the sewers and the hooded lanterns and the caspian is on the surface and then we go into fissure out fish people fish people i don't know how they finish no but okay I like this I like this plan I think if we can push her up into an ambush that would be probably the best time that's ideal but back up back up is the rat Prince yeah I think we need to get them involved for sure and promise him all the thieves he can eat I mean no absolutely promise them all the thieves he can eat yeah that's my default but we also the weed you have to keep a little separation because I don't know how much the Caspian and the hooded lanterns are going to like working side by side hour oh yeah compadre so they definitely need to not meet yeah I think we need to keep them yeah we need to give them a different 90-day probation yeah it's on a need-to-know basis each each sect has their job and they don't need to know about the others okay yeah now question is which way are we gonna go in so I think if we I don't think we should go based on the the crater I'm worried about that one I like the one I like trying to find the hole you crawled into I like that idea I say that we we look for a bit if it seems like it's failing I would second option would be the the dungeons I think is that because I could potentially get us right inside because if we go through the cistern we have to do that riddle again even though we think we know the answer what if they change the dungeons if they change that you know I'm just not drinking anything in this I'm gonna make a I'm gonna just did you say nope I mean I'm doing it now but on the in yeah I'm worried I am worried about anything that we drink down there so that's just me not crawling through Syria so that's just incoming you IOB just BYOB cool so I'm saying okay yeah bring your own so that's our plan to get in where are we going from you said you want to avoid the one over the crater so if we can so the other options were buckle down row you could come down champions away from inside the city yeah or come up from the sewage exit point near where Styx is fairy mores yeah or if you wanted to look at any point along champions way you could likely find a sewer entrance from the city streets themselves in in there it's just that I in that respect you would be heading in above-ground through like if you didn't want to have to go into the spokes at all yeah and you wanted to completely come underground champions way or the the sewage exit point neither near the ferry would be your two options so you still have seeming I was just looking at that that not that's a part of the plan that I didn't mention right before we go in I'm disguising the three of us as Queens men yeah just generic we do now know out there their fractions and it can't be the same Queens men that we posed as last time because the Queen clearly caught us and knows who those people are so we need new personas new alibis but I was thinking could we just walk in the front door and go to the exact same way we went like into that one building downstairs into the corpse hole into the sewers we could go literally the same way if we seeming dead I don't know I would rather sneak in sure that would be through the bars where you were pit fighting yeah yeah there's a lot more people to talk to and that and how do we send a signal to the surface to start an attack there you do know this really cool ritual alright cool so yeah I'll cast am i able to include include Jupiter and some and maybe not the reference but I kind of want the reference needs to be on on an like he needs to be part of it yeah but if he's on the same channel as everyone else they're gonna be like it's that you can do one way I think it's a party line so everybody is it's like a speakerphone okay I will tell them that it's hard like you can send one to one within but then you can also send one to all but you the the sender is the one that's in charge of whether or not everybody's will just explain to me that it's it's eight creatures total and we'll just explain to them that our it's my cousin bill cousin princess no princess princess petunia and she likes to talk a lot and she's all feel crazy sure and she's kind of bloodthirsty she likes she's very excited about this attack because she gets to kill and people she that we hit her fronting the rest of the family because she's sort of a cannibal and maybe we don't have to put the yeah brands I'm really starting to think that we don't go for it you we trust him is there a way that I can get in touch with River and algae to do that whole like a tower telepathic bond before we go yes you could do if you go back and work with River the two of you together could set that up I think we definitely do the Academy because you use spells right I have yeah only one level one spell up so recruit the rod prince tell them the plan go to the academy tower get telepathic bond cast on the people who need it and then go through the sewers entering from champions way yes and going under the spokes looking for the cavern but if we can't find it if we can't find it going through to the dungeons having the rattling block off all exits from the smokes in the sewers and keep an eye out for stragglers and yeah and then have Casspi on the streets with their friends in the in the sewers sheets and sewers and lanterns on the roofs yes we got there I think so I think that makes I think I understand and I'm not sure if it makes sense also seeming fun also seeming yes okay he's like took that spot established I hope you guys have written your plan down is all ready to go okay what so it sounds like yeah you're you have a couple of preparatory steps to accomplish before you set this plan into motion you need to recruit the rat Prince you need to notify the rest of the hooded lanterns and get that and decide which of the hooded lanterns you're going to order on the attack and coordinate with Jupiter Jones and then finally also check in with the amethyst Academy and get their support yes yes yes yes so you can you'll be able to work with the if you want to recharge your rings you're gonna have to head back to the Academy tower proper you're gonna have to head back to the barracks for the for everything else and you'll have to head back up to the Northcliff district to read manner authors where II asked to Oscar your ins old place where you sent the rat prince now one thing I'm worried about is having a space where we can't be scribe upon for when we're talking about this the the I guess we could be getting screwed on right now so we just did our whole plan like twice out loud no guys I cast telepathic bond without anybody noticing and we've been communicating telepathically this whole time as was i yelling it Oh out out into the world your honey you're at the top of the tower like no we only know telepathic retro actively yeah we're doing this we're so confident in our plan that we don't care if people know about it because I think that about scrying like every 20 seconds I forget it's a thing I it's a spell that I've never used and therefore nobody else like because all our hair and our bodily things and that's another one we were in prison with the queen of Thieves I know yeah hmm remember when we bled hallow for her like all over the dungeons and everything okay well okay we can do it not I'm not scared go to the academy and discuss another plan if we yeah if we go to the Academy will just change plans yes grab everything we just said let's go to the queen of Thieves surrender yeah and tell her that we want to work with her and that she's she's the waiter she should have been the faction we went with at the beginning right all along so let's go on our way to the queen of Thieves and I wink up into the air but then I realized that I was probably not the best place to win oh wait I'm supposed to wink at you guys not at her you do true say things yet there's probably gonna orb like right above you as it's not been enough time though no yeah be ready in another couple days well probably right well no we need it we need it for the plan yeah so maybe this will take a couple days to make a couple days to do maybe go to that Academy laughs yeah okay so we'll go to the barracks go to do you want to do the barracks first we need a place to be able to discuss it where there's no scrying in the tower so we go to the tower and then come back to the tower we go to the barracks tell them to meet us in the tower are they allowed to be in the tower I don't know ocean isn't it like my tower right now yeah but they need they need the potion yeah in this exper go yeah that's on my tower but I kind of live there like like my scarf Villas you got a good lease yeah I think we should uh you know what let's go talk to the rap no I think we should do prints first yeah get him into position can you can you anti scry a tall person is right there there are I don't you like the Archmage or somebody the spells that come on use two blocks crying are non detection okay Morden kindness' private sanctum which Awards an area and mind blank and then there are some magic items that will protect you as well guys I'm pretty sure tiny Hut blocks crime I have no basis for you've seen this in the tiny Hut every time they watched us the whole time what about wall of force nope that probably see right through that I mean you can see that through that we mean your counter strategy of using telepathic bond to communicate is an effective one because the scrying spell is limited to what it can actually see what is perceivable is if you're really there unless they've got a fancy magic item in which case well then I've been opening is this the fancy magic because I every time we do the plan I do it out loud I once I mimic the words and they're just reading my lips only what we're what they're hearing do we know what's crying is as an Academy member I can tell you that's crying I'm just gonna I'm just gonna guess what I think I know here scrying is a hundred percent a choice on whether you want to hear or see yeah I mean I the Archmage said it it's trust me I do have I went to school drop down illusory script I don't know if that would help that's just telepathic dude - to be clear with the scrying sensor you can see and hear from it it's like your eyeball is there your eyes and ears are there or maybe you can do both at the same time well look if the if they were scrying on us they already know no because we were using telepathic bond it's starting right now if we want to do the 8-hour telepathic bond but we're waiting for the goggles the goggles we might as well wait at the tower until we get the goggles ready and then we can immediately do the big bond and then leave right from there so I think we should do the tower last yeah let's do that then and then so we'll go see the reference and they'll go to the barracks yeah bear in mind that the telepathic bond you need all the people that you want to telepathically bond with present at the time that that is done and so you would need to bring anyone that you want with you to the Academy tower for that purpose nice Jupiter Jones and Ansem and summer Petra is it a ritual yeah can you cast it more than once yeah can we passed it with the rat Prince and then cast it at the barracks no no I think he needs to be there we won't include Mike just cast it alone it will only be one hour hmm I say we leave the rap prince out of it the reference just needs to stay in position okay he just needs to guard the sewers whatever thing is do we need to talk to the group altogether or can you kill me when we go see the reference you cast it and then we go back to the barracks and then you cast it again Orestes I think it's I this way given given the circumstances you guys will probably need to muster everybody at the barracks together yeah okay yeah give it given how difficult it is to get people in and out of the the tower and given the fact that you have to drink aqua exper go you probably don't want to imbibe ox with aqua exper go the day of a major operation because what happens if you react badly to it that's true okay so grab Prince tower then the barracks and the barracks yeah make our final yeah man and it's and to some of my things there's no way that the Academy is going to permit anyone to come inside the tower that is not you guys that's fair so there there's our plan we do that Prince we do the amethyst Academy tower we get our rings filled we get our heroes feast hmm and we then go to the barracks finalize plans head out sounds good so are you going to bring anyone with you to get the rat prince or yeah it's just gonna go on your own I think we should go on well go on our own no rest of the Rangers to head back to the barracks and we'll catch them up there so Jupiter Jones and Ansem nod and by-and-large little the way that you're headed is pretty close together because you've got to get out of the city as well so this is very awkward I thought you guys were all going in a different direction I thought we were too I forgot the directions which sorry I love Jupiter uh well in that case let me tell you about the time that I fought a Manticore oh wow I've only killed one of those really you killed a Manticore yeah I only fought one Oh what happened it flew away I stabbed it with my sword and it screamed at me and then it flew right off and certainly throwing these spikes at me you can see it he bares his chest it's like you got me here here here and here and as he does this unlike are you impressed with his lack of nipples or his festive more the scars yeah respect a good scar yeah tells the story you know well did you know that Pluto killed a plant but if one scar tells a story then my body is an epic poem that was beautiful Wow oh this is our turn well see ya you're really warming up to him he's fun he's actually he's very muscular yeah I mean I there's times when I'm jealous I wrote on me yeah there he's loyal he's a loyal Caspian and he's a strong willed fighter and he's it's good to have it's good to have some easy to manipulate people it's easy it's nice to have some people that are on our side for once yes you know he's less sharp than a one-year-old cheddar I don't know about that so take it with a grain so you made your way from the clock tower back towards the barracks where you parted ways with andsome the hooded lanterns and the other caspian 'he's leaving the gate the barracks at Shepherds gate you head out as you have now done many times across Shepards way and through the sprawl on the north end of the city back towards Reed manner the pathway that you take through the ramshackle buildings is a well-worn one that they owe you have led them down many many times now you know you're back the back alleys of it and I will have you all roll me a d66 Klunk Klunk Klunk five-plus okay come on 1v the journey proceeds extremely smoothly and in fact the streets out this way are deserted the as you head along in fact the one thing that you do catch sight of are a group of hooded lanterns on patrol that let you know yet we found a group of there were a group of Knoll stragglers up this way we we took them out you just take that path way up that way Lord Commander it it's all clear such a good job mantastic here's a snack and I toss about cookies cookies this whole time she eating stale bread for four days skits biscuits you always got to have them on point biscuit oh they get a biscuit for killing a couple knows do a good job I'll give you like three I haven't done a good job apparently step it up are as you as you part ways the the hooded lantern say if you're you're heading up north further Lord Commander just be careful we caught sight of another nest of NAT of rattling that have taken up into the the old manor district it the numbers of them I mean they've just gotten big let me tell you that they've been coming down into the city they've been eating off all the knoll corpses there's a lot of them up there not hearing anything bad about this sure we'll keep our eyes open we need new garbageman going forward in our new dragon home I mean of course we'll keep an eye out for them and kill them if we see them yes telepathic wink as you head up towards the North cliff districts where the larger estates and manor houses are you come up to the familiar row where Reed Manor is at which the the manor itself having been burned so the upper levels of it are distraught are in disarray but you can see that somehow the collapse what remains of the Timbers of the building have collapsed in on themselves into the sort of pyramid that this hole has been dug up around where Oscar urines library was almost like this wide burrow and as you cut and the smell of rat and meat and this kind of acrid odor hits you and you're like there's there's rats around here lovely this brings back memories remember that first mission we did together guys there's done I didn't kill Oscar the one where Pluto fell into a head full of rattling x' and spiked spikes that was that was fun I slid into it dramatically well I don't want to go first into the dramatical you know what for some reason I don't oh I'll go first all right thanks Mayo and I walked towards okay as you walk towards the rat hole that Oscar urines old home has become the Timbers again they've all collapsed in and you can see that there are these drag marks and this row of wet and mud leading up the wall from the front door to the library has been completely pulled away and torn down almost all the outer walls have collapsed collapsed in and the entire second level is just a complete ruin and so the what what there's the remnants of several bookshelves that are splayed about around Oscar you're in secret room and a burro has emerged up around it as if the rattling 'z have dug away that the floor words like they pulled up all the floorboards gotten down to the foundations and just it made this hole much larger than it used to be and they and as you do so and as you come up several rattling heads all pop up and several skirt and screw back down and one kind of stays there shuttering and shaking and and look look as you start to approach hey little guy where's the prince this railing is very young it's you I just speak with animals it replies back my my brothers look at him look you'll be here yes good job yeah tell him the ghosts are here and they need to speak with him now he scurries back down and a few and you can hear like the sound of the coming from below and the and a few moments later up waddles the rat prince and he is still wearing this the tatters of the dress that you gave him before and he has this some somewhere he found this cloak and his head a crown fashioned for him and he's got this long stick that has several skulls on the end of it that he that he's holding but he still has like the leather armor underneath and several of his wicked knives at his at his side and he oh my friends the ghosts oh you're back it is been so long yes yes yes so happy to see you you're not dead yes you yes it has been very very good up here yes yes yes this has been very good home for us yes yes yes looks like emotion crown on your head oh yes

health and your children are very very good health yesyes we go into the city and we find all those bark bark yap yap-yap men they all dead they all getting killed they just live left in the streets perfectly good food why humans no eat good food you're welcome we bless those that question all the time I mean for you we ant that was a gift it was actually there was a gift from the ghostly three yeah some bad things happen yes yes but things are mostly good mostly good yes yes we have I send many many of my children back into the city some of them never come back but that is okay yes yes it's all right we have the most important mission from the god from the right God red God he speaks for us in the most in time of crisis I'm so glad Ignatius isn't here the rat God told us that you would be coming yes yes yes yeah wait you talked to the right guard oh yes yes we're not me not me but my new girlfriend she talked to rat god she's very very good about the whole thing where did she talk to the rat guard oh we have Great Temple downstairs yes yes we must see this no that's a false red God right there what if it's the what if it is the cracker you know what I don't know we don't actually know that it's then we're at a false rat God some goods are tricksters and they try to convince you that they are your God when they're not have you seen the statue oh yes does it look the same as the statue that was in the rat's nest we make some changes to it it's even better now yes yes did it have horns and a big belly yes yes and why is such good god it was such a big belly bigger belly better God Oh God no I don't think we can convince some of that I think that's a that's a that's an intense battle to have but we can try you tell us where we find many many shiny rocks and we go and we get them and we bring the back yes yes and you don't give them to us no no no no no rat God wanted them directly we we said we said what about what about the three ghosts should we go get them and rat God is like no no no no they busy with something else you go get go go get more I pull veil away from the opening I'm just like we need to be really careful here we do not we do not go in front of that statue nope and we play it up we have to keep we have to keep this up so we need to we need them to think that we still speak for the rat God even if they believe that that is the rack odd so we can't have any sort of like confrontation here between us and that thing no no I don't want to go down and see it but I'm hoping we can convince them to listen to us and not do what he's doing we will okay you should come down you should see we have great party we do big offering there'll be lots of food yes yes the important mission is is too important for us to pause for a rest unfortunately don't want to give chef food with record we share food with the rat God had many a times rat Prince it is not in one place that we must do this but rat God said you were coming they make big meal for you we are here how will you bring it up I will eat the burden you see we it's a surprise for the rack god we have to we want to surprise the rack guard with a great offering so we need you to be super super see how you surprised I got rat God knows all rat Gardens he goes underneath all the floorboards of all the buildings and he knows that there is yes he sees all he knows all why you trying to hide from that God no it's for for good things like birthday yeah it's his birthday it got bad God is turning ten million what birthday it's an annual celebration all its annual it guys that's a really really long time I dig in it's a really long time he's been around for a long time longer than the rats and it's a oh yes yes if the rats came home oh yes we want to have a big celebration for the rat God and the rat guard might know but we have to try real hard to pretend like you do petunia like as when you were in your dress in your dress okay make it the session Jack yeah I was gonna try to good wrong one rat the reference looks looks at you and goes and he starts crying and he should say my children make big feast they all make feast we all go get big horses and we get manlings and we get and we even got dwarf and we start cooking them up waiting for you to come back and you don't want to eat with us in front of our God we tell you about not killing humans but I go and I get up to him and I'm like what did we say about it my prince but record said it was okay he said we should you know that we need lots of blood there's something that the right God wants more than anything as part of his feast and that is the head of the queen of Thieves who that that is your mission rat God want a head of a queen yes why not I just marry one of my girlfriends cut her head off and connect it needs to be a specific queen this is a queen who thinks she is above it all oh and she is not no she challenges the rat god no no no no no that not good dad not good that's why your mission is going to be to help us kill and eat her but you'll get the eater on behalf of the God not us yeah it's a gift for you that you are the one who will get to eat the body but we keep the head persuasion check get her which dice do I pick one okay [Music] fifteen the rat Prince says so you say we need to make even bigger dinner for red god yeah was really really special dinner yes this head of this queen of Thieves for a reference yes reference give to Rekha yes yes what'd she look like oh that's a tough part we changes her face yeah but then how you know it her what if I get someone's face give it to rap God and rat gods like that not her how I know well that's the challenge that's why it's the biggest offering you can give is because when you do find it sir she does sound very difficult Oh maybe rat God just like horse we have a plan and you and your whole family are going to be very important for that plan rise above all the other rats I want to use the helm of telepathy to first dish detect his thoughts there's not a lot going on up there you pretty much just hear an echo of what he said does he have enough intelligence he does he does but he's thinking like he's thinking in it in his head I hope right God not to get mad I don't want to get smitten by rat God do I listen to ghost or God ghost God but God sent ghosts yes yes yes this makes sure should I suggest that he what and what were listen to the ghosts I gonna cast suggestion in the form of rack God a reference we need you to do this for us we need you to help us kill the queen of Thieves to appease the rack God he gets a 11 on his wisdom needs a 13 okay the rad prince the the the Lord Mayor's circlet blazes and this hypnotic energy comes out from it as the rat princes suggested and the other writings Oh Oh shiny ghost making lots of lights oh oh sparkly and the rat Prince goes then responds and says yes he says yes we hope you find this queen of Thieves right what you need I go get much my sons and daughters and we eat them all you know the sewer system really well right yes yes yes can we see the map I hand what these scrawling he looks at this okay imagine it goes scratches and scratches get kick it kick it and this this little rat comes up and the rats got a pair of glasses what you deep rich watch what is this is the sewer system of the city oh and this riches reaches into his backpack where he's got a little scroll and he lays it on top oh yes now we made you see CSSS any any points in tenses and he says to reference to the rat print to reference he says so the rat prints looking down at the at the map and says yes his prints this were a big hole is this is where our last batch of children go in to Cobo find big big D rocks to bring back to Rekha and this where they go where they all get a kidnapped yes is yes and this were they go where they not come back and as he points he points to the spots on the crater and he points to where several of the hooded lanterns patrols have been when he's like this is where they go and they not come back and he points around where the buckle down row is and says when he says this is where some of them get count yes we know this but we know this one there are many rat traps there they tragic tropi catches engages yes is yes huh how how often all right all the time happening long time long long long long time even before ghosts come when we go down here they can't just some of us get put in cages and we see them they take that engages can you show us everywhere that rats have been captured all over this place yes yes can you seaming us as rats we don't want to get captured don't but we tried that last time I mean you didn't try that it just happened I think he caught her goes and goes [Music] because he does and this rattling with this huge nose that is glowing purple and has flecks of delirium in it and he's actually got spines of delirium growing down the side of him he comes out anytime like yes yes yes what you need and scripture says Oh big big nose but God but he get out he get out he tell you what happened big nose tell us the story big nose yeah because oh yes I dare for many long time long time they cracked me with whip and then they give me stick with claw on it and they tell me dig dig dig where were you digging they had this day they had big gave big gave and we did you did you dick they think I dead and they leave me there to rot and then they run away hmm do you know how to get into that cave from the sewers yes it it underneath the big hole they're digging at the meteor underneath the big hole yes yeah they had cats they had other cats and the cats he does with whips and they make us diggy diggy I know no other cat no but what like like her you have to oh yeah we have to get the cats then do we they make us bring the shinies and put them in car in big big wagon and then the cats give them to humans I'm wondering if that's the way we need to go yeah but what if we get eyes on the rats what if we get big nose to take us to the digging site or is that off track are we trying to get do you think the digging place or at least the place where he was captured is related to the the Queen scratches talks with big nose a little bit and they go they go back and forth and it seems like as scriptures tries to to suraíhs what big nose was saying about where he went and big noses a little bit incoherent and describing it but scratches and turns up and says oh yes he means he's here it here any points to the crater and holds his map up over your map and grabs a pen and here a in his tail he's writing with his tail and he draws these lines and he says this is it and it looks like there are a set of caves coming off of the crater around where the sewer line was and does it look like it goes up into the underside of the Queen's lair grich's isn't sure but it could at the very least it would connect through the sewer tunnel that might be our most unknown way in and I'm assuming that because it's by the crater it's in deep A's yeah at least we have a way in then not many people are going to take the next the next question is where do we position the rattling so that they don't get captured and what's up with more Tabac see well you said you didn't know any other tip actually growing up no I didn't really see that maybe one or two traveling around the city but I didn't know them I was really the only two back see that I knew cuz I know myself you're the only taxi I've known yeah so yeah it's gonna say did you see them growing up did I were there any in the amethyst Academy or there were not but there were other Kovacs he living in Drakon Heim very enough that anyone could tell you what a tip acts like it's like it's a backseat bird knowing but being late but also and not like freaked out about it yeah but not many there was a small enclave of Tabac see that used to live in the the spokes and the sprawls so it's possible that these are other tabac see that have have survived and it's possible it's possible and almost certain that there could be tabac see amongst the Queen's men okay is that did big nose oh yes did did they glow purple day rocks no the tabac the like cats like her did they glow purple no no no okay it just says more about our slight more resistance to the haze I guess than anything right because they were in the deep A's because if they're just chilling in the I still think that's a that's a better route and I think maybe even if the rats don't go all the way into the tunnels at least if we can position them in the sewers just in case they can be more of a warning than anything I'm gonna like talk to scratches and big nose to get to kind of like enquire with them back and forth about where they have been captured and whether or not they know of a safe way to station themselves around the outside talking to big nose and a few of the other rattling it seems like the going consensus amongst the rattling x' is that when they go into the South parts of the city some of the humans there don't kill them they try to catch them even in the sewers especially on the surface especially in the sewers yeah but we're gonna be going with them mm-hmm so we can at least lead them and like clear out sand to be to be clear there the rattling x' that you're talking about our groups of small like small groups of rattling scavengers yeah that are you know it's not on words to think that a couple of Queen's men or a couple of people could capture a rattling and that it happens a lot in this area well the Queen's men are there and they probably want people to fight in the pits and entertainment or to eat or to eat sounds like to get delirium so do you think that we need to lead the rats and like secure the tunnels around and I get them into position or sure now should we do the surface attack but the one thing that you get from talking to scratches as he as he sorry as scritch is kind of relays how many of the other eiling's have been captured she says like there could be hundreds of rattling x' that have been captured that are all being kept down there man I'm in the army down there already we need to set them free yeah so we need to start rattling revolution yes we will free on behalf of the rat god we will try and free for your people rattling people being held captive by this evil queen the rat prince was all that is oh so good you are truly savior from sin from rat God we rise up and we eat all the humans don't you forget it yeah so you say you say this queen of these we go get her we go get her and we save all our friends all my children yes yeah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes the the rat Prince suddenly all the rattling Sh here and many of them start dancing and yes they're all up on their tippy taps I join in this is uh yeah this could get a little out of hand but I'd rather it be a little wild on their hand you notice a little as well as this is happening more rattling have been gathering around and listening to this whole conversation happening and there's perhaps over a hundred rattling that are now like circling around listening and several of them are like up on the roof looking down of what remains of the building coming up around the hole and several of the other manor houses though looking out for the wind we nose are many more rattling zazz well and as they gather round I share the tales of all that we have accomplished in Drakon hi man hi they will defeat the evil queen who has enslaved their people and then I waved him a golfclap yeah so I feel like I would just like iterate to them kind of an overall plan and try to arrange it so that where are they gonna meet us are they gonna meet us what if they just took all the choke points they they have their map we know their map even at the main toilets doesn't have to be the little ones like just the main spots and then rat prints scratches and big nose can lead us to the pathway that they talked about yep right to where they get caught and captured I will move the rest of the rattling x' into chokepoints yeah around because if they get captured we're just gonna free him anyways yeah yep squishes is writing on your map and scratches has absolutely immaculate handwriting like he wouldn't believe that that tail could write like that but it's just like uh-huh screams how'd you learn to write I read many many books yes how'd you learn to read my god teach me Oh No he made a deal what did that cost you oh you you know I thought it'd just be it'd be like record say to me one day all the screeches you are very smart I call you screeches now and then rat God give me book and I read it I like it very very much well Booker said oh if that little boy who gets baked into pie well well I read it many many times in my favorite stores to go all right uh which keep him engaged feed him yes yes it says then he get bacon do pie I love sorry yeah yeah yeah I don't know we got scratches can you tell time what do you want me to tell time so Oh too bad Prince to tell him when it's time for y'all to leave and meet us at where do you want me to tell time when tell reverence when do you come meet you yes yes yes yes I mean they could leave ahead of time and meet us at the point yeah right where are we going days from now on the rapid turn turns please oh yes screech is very very smart I tried to ask her out but she she took her to me she out of my league in two days it's always time they leave yeah dude in two days scratches in in how many meals so they have a day as many as we can have okay I was trying to find that what's like a way everything to them very much how can we can help them count why limit yourself to just do you guys know when the Sun comes up and down can you see that from here yes yes okay when the Sun goes up and comes down twice Venus Venus at this screeches is like why do to it go up you go down you go up okay yeah yeah yeah and then on the second time it goes down you come meet us you come and you meet us and we'll meet you as soon as it's coming up again where do you want to meet the rally's should we meet them in the sewers by Champions way and they can lead us to that yeah crater spot yeah traveling 100 islands can be very powerful yeah you know you've been on the opposite under that yep and so I want to be carried for the first time I read by a wave of right yeah yeah yeah I think if they're by champions way yeah then if we can meet by the sewers there and I point to it on the map meet us here in two days time and wait for us key piece yes wait for us all right um screeches you've done a great job and I toss them a cookie I get cookie references I introduce you to screeches I not

amethyst Academy yes to get our rings filled and get river and Eldrick to meet us to come with us to the barracks to cast spells okay or at least just river cool as you head back towards the barracks can I have all of you roll me at d6 please the one a36 okay you make your way back through the sprawl towards the barracks of the hooded lanterns and as you do so heading along the familiar routes back towards the last patrol of the hooded lanterns [Music] they oh you see it it's the three hooded lanterns that you ran into before and they are dead in the middle of the street no I run over to them okay you rush you you run over to them and the three of them are in the streets as you rush over to them what are the two of you gonna do I'm gonna hang back and start looking around the area to see if I see any signs of movement or activity or anything okay so I'm scouting I rush over at Klunk Klunk speed so I get there when I get there okay they oh all three of you can give me a perception check Sebastian you can do so with advantage Vale you do so with disadvantage yeah 22 1825 okay as you have 18 22 to 25 okay as the three of you rush forward Sebastian you hang back to to look around yeah and you're you're looking about but veo when you come around come up to the three men as you get closer then you can smell something almost saw Furyk on them and Lulu know as you run forward where is your attention it's kind of more catching up to via okay so I'm kind of like I'm keep she get there quick and I'm just kind of making my way towards her you you turn your you you turn your attention over to veo and the route the ruins here are very very low the haze is light around here but there's there's a light fog and as you approach you see this and you see this unfortunately Sebastian although you're looking around you don't see it see react any of this veil there is you see in the moment as you approach the Vaught the bodies and Pluto you see this there is a long thin line of line of some materials extending out from one of the men towards one of the nearby ruins and Pluto you just see this spark racing across it towards where the three men are and Vale use and little you see it first like a fuse it's a fuse I can I throw my javelin at the wire - you want to throw your javelin at the wire yeah they'll what do you want to do um how close am I to the wire use when you saw this you were right over the bot the the men's bodies and you are and you could reach out to the wire it's going underneath we're over to one of their bodies would I have enough time to grab it and throw it to grab the wire and throw it yeah okay will will act on these two things so Vail you rush in you go to grab the wire and as you do so you go to pull it and you can see that one of the men isn't a body at all it's someone has taken some mesh and the hooded lanterns cloaks and armor and put several barrels that are leaking this oily black fluid out around it it's not oil it it's oil not blood yeah and the other two the other two bodies are real you go to yank the the wire and you're just gonna toss it that what you want to do I want to dimension door towards holding onto it towards where where it's from okay yeah you you want to hold it dimension door yeah with the wire yeah okay the wire is an object so you won't be able to bring whatever it's attached to with you Oh candor that's something you but you can just dimension to her over to where that today yeah and pollute oh you want to throw your javelin at the wire I want to try to like identifying it as a fuse I want to try to cut it before it gets to me in the sacral bodies with the javelin 25 okay you hit the though the wire okay now here here's what we're gonna do I want you to roll a d6 on a four or five or six you break the wire on a one the clink of the spark causes it to just burn and on a cure you miss I'm a two or three and it'll detonate immediately and on a two or three you've got another chance it's a five okay the wire snaps and breaks as and as veo teleports over towards where the wire was originating from roll for initiative whoa that was intense who set this and must to find out yeah it's gonna go say hi [Music] okay we're going back we gotta be myself [Music] whereabouts on the map is this are we using that yep cool so son unhealthy at the your cut I thought the intersection no the close one in the right in the middle where you about Pluto yeah yep and the fuse is going into the ruined building with the balcony yeah its words for you we're get ambushed ambush okay ambush alright in it nervo yeah like I was like sure myself like kind of like that half jog being like trying to catch up with veo because I feel like we're very comfortable in these ruins that we walk through them so often like we're like oh yeah we just casually and walking Ludo so Vale you teleported straight straight do you want to go into the building yeah okay cuz that's the direction it came from but you have no idea within that we're like that's the way it went but you don't have any exact idea of where it originated from that's just your best guess it doesn't lie or go like into the window or she did not see it yeah yeah she didn't see you by the by the time it was there like you'd have to go and investigate and see where the were the ashes of it lead from Pluto you can see though that crouched up on the second floor of the cerumen stone building is a man yep it's a man he's he's hiding there and he is brandishing and he is loading a bolt into a crossbow uh-oh what did you guys get for 10/10 prevail six six for Sebastian 2020 for Pluto okay I was too busy I finally noticed all of this happening and all I did was put my goggles on and then stand there and I'm like and then you're like there's a man and I look up and he's just like bloating his crossbow at me and I'm like oh oh no where's my I'm not prepared for the no iodide picture you put on the goggles and then you're like guys where's my goggles like it's like that classic goggles so they're on your head [Laughter] I'm gonna stab Ryan okay so the man the man with the crossbow loads the crossbow he's first act and catches a bit of Flint lights the crossbow up and fires down at the body no he hits that's a good thing that goggles are on Pluto you're in the impact zone so I'm gonna have you roll a d6 and on anything but a one it ignites four okay there is a thunderous explosion as the barrel of gunpowder ignites it's a man you can make a dexterity saving throat yeah you have a thing don't you you have things that help I have hopefully so many things it this explosion obviously targets only me right oh I'll let you use the bonus cuz you know anyone in the area I got a nineteen you successfully make your saving throat and you only take 20 points of fire damage now can i when do I get my reaction you can take your reaction now if you so I want to use a shield master and do the Cape half damage I think it is or no damage yeah no damage so I'm gonna use my reaction and just I hold up my shield I go it's a man it's like when Captain America gets like blasted and I do the top I need to tuck and I just take a jump and tuck I go flying back towards me Oh okay as that as that goes off then from the other side he he leaps off down the other side of the building and runs into the out and starts booking it excuse you little you're up I am I launched back from the explosion you made your save and brace it with your shield so no you're not at all cool I recall the the javelin and I just turn and I can't see him over here I mean go through the buildings through a window I want to do height my my dad taught me height so I'm gonna I want can I climb up the ruins can I get to the

okay we do not expect this it's no veo it is your turn okay so I do I see the guy run beside you you see the guy running yeah and from where you are you could not have seen that Sebastian just went down Pluto would've but Pluto because of where your attention was where those shots came from give no idea you would you can't fall yeah ow so I see this guy right down the alley yeah and I I jump off the balcony I use my claws and I like scrape down the building cool I realign what time of day is it I'm gonna say it's the afternoon okay but it's like I guess late oh yeah okay and I feel einige ility right in front of him mm-hmm and I take my crossbow and I start trying to shoot him in the face nice and I got run from this dodge this yeah so we're gonna go for it so what do I a 13 that is a miss less than 13 also a Miss OH 22 third time's the charm you're like right up beside him finally getting a third time there's too close a little too close yep 20 damage 20 damage I get one more is

sure you again and I like my turn is done but I go to like just load things up and get ready for the next Sebastian buddy and you're unconscious yeah sorry dude what are you thinking about what are you dreaming about um dreaming about heroes feasts bathtubs and how it would really help furred and Caspian okay the guy right up in front of you of a oh he turns around and stumbles forward and into the street fires his crossbow at you getting a natural one new armor is really good huh and so he stumbles forward mate takes a wide shot it hits the ground and and he's like well I'm I guess I'm about as good a shot as you are let me show you and he and then he is going to veer down the street this way was he base with him he was but she's not holding a melee weapon so he doesn't care so and then he zombie to use his bonus action to dash he's got cunning action so he's gonna keep going yep you can try to run away you can try alrighty we go to pollute Oh so I'm looking at I'm calling back the the javelin mm-hmm and I'm looking at veo who just like shot a guy right in the face and then he's running away again but and I turn around I see Sebastian just laying there yes you crossbow bolts in his back and I like killing people that are running away but I think I like Sebastian just a little bit more it's closed it's closed everyone but I love myself so I'm going to jump down you jump down revelation and and I'm gonna run to Sebastian's body okay can I make it I yes you can and I'm gonna give him I'm gonna rub some ointment on his face you know rub some of the restorative ointment okay that cures the poison condition and so you are no longer an unconscious Sebastian I massage it right up like in the nostril it does heal you because the the Kagan's appointment or the restorative one and however you wanna say it I can't say Kaitlyn I can't even I'm gonna try not it yeah it's a German yeah yeah yeah well actually this one I think is one of the ones made by it was this the lat the Academy's the Academy recipe black chicken crossed out amethyst Academy old man how much does it heal me 18 points and then I'm gonna do like can I approximately where the the arrows the bolts are so you take an action to make a perception check you can look around but he's gonna stand over his body okay with my shield and I'm gonna be looking the way that I like where his back was facing okay I like looking around all right that sounds good okay so I could have gone bad okay so Pluto across will hit you in the back what getting a 20 versus your a see that it's okay okay so that's why be so that's gonna be 20 points of damage out and make a constitution saving throw 24 you are good you're and a second shot rings out getting a 23 against your AC ah for another do I turn around another the other bolt and then I get hit a bat in the back again no they actually actually as you turn around it comes in and hits you in the in the front ah and make another Constitution saving throat oh God 19 okay you succeed your save there now because you turned around because you didn't get knocked unconscious by the shots it's like a it's like a cheap Halloween costume it's one of those like the arrows looks like it's coming through me it's a ball what are you know you see two black cloak men coming up from this the second story of the ruined buildings firing the crossbow shots and as the the second one ducks down you can see that there's almost like lizard like scales running up all the way down up and down his face and it looks like he might have like this tail swaying about and as you turn around the the lizard faced man leaps up onto the onto this lat that has been laid across these two buildings and into the building and the other man leaps off the balcony also into the building as as well and the two of them are now out of your sight that's the rudest thing I have ever seen via what will you do I cast zephyr strike as a bonus section and I bolt after the guy that I know is there I do down the street yeah okay dad are you going right up to now right up to him um and just like five like ten feeling and I used my longbow and I'm gonna take two shots one of them with advantage because I was a first-rate cool wow that was terrible a five and a four so ten that's a Miss no I hit skills at you and been like I heels like everyone said you were the deadliest shot in this city you're pathetic Sebastian you are a conscious it's your turn what will you do I use Pluto to pull myself up and he do but I didn't see those two guys at all so I have no idea do you want to go hunting yes okay um hold on I I think I have an idea if I if I moved to these windows can I like peer out and see Vail yes you can I am going to twin cast haste and Pluto okay so I I pull myself up and I'm like give me a second and I run and I peer out the window so I can see there and I just go and blast each of them and what does haste look like when I cast it wins the winner a bolt of shadowy energy infuses both of them and their eyes turn black yeah and it's almost like there's no the way that I imagine it is that if you ever seen chrono photography chrono photography is when you take multiple exposures of a thing in time and it creates that like motion trail imagine that Maidan of shadow stuff yes surrounding both of them oh cool all right so you guys both have haste you have plus two two AC you have an advantage on dexterity saving throws you gain an additional action each of your turns mmm can be used to attack - disengage hide or use an object it's an additional bonus action and just to be aware that it's an additional action but you can only make one attack if you use the attack action yeah and there's I can do action action bonus action yeah still okay yeah then I move into the corner and like crouch down okay just like you guys got this I've done my part I have some bolts to pull out of my back okay I've never felt this fast before okay we go never come to the top of the round with our first assassin gap there and he seeing this shadowy energy infusing infusing veo he's going to all-out run so he's gonna double dash and he's going to leap up into the building run up the stairs on on the second level this one yeah and then dive out the window on the other side and continue and continue around it's like and I will just give him some acrobatics checks yeah so he dies out the window and rolls out on the other side the shattering glass all through the streets and he moves 90 feet as he dashes up bounds off the the walls and through and I can hear the shattering glass yes I know he's not stealthy about yeah Pluto it's your turn I want to return these bolts to their original sender okay so I am going to dimension door with my new action into that house okay which floor the second floor okay are they there there is no one there is there a downstairs a trapdoor that as you dimension door in you you the the trap door slammed shut son of a junk yeah I'm opening it up I rip it open okay you rip the trap door and I have ignatius out but not on fire but I rip off whose you ripped the trap door open and you can see the that basically the the window out here is open and there's no one in the ground floor either the but there's a single window with the shutters banging open and the two of them get back you're fast there's also like a you move double I think a nice jump out the window can I fit out that window uh give me an athletics check your speed is doubled am I gonna get out that window with a 16 you come crashing out the window and you fall on the ground taking seven points of damage and when I stand up and I run after them okay I want to get to at least the first guy yeah yeah I can base the boat yeah yeah you can oh and then I just start and I'm mad at this point because I don't like falling I hate the fenestration and then I'm gonna just start and I crit the first one nice nice so what's the what's the crit stuff max damage on the weapon die [Music] so he's gonna take 24 damaged nice and I'm gonna use anyone I want him to make a strength safe cool he gets a 16 he is going to fall down and take another seven damage okay and then I'm gonna attack him again nice and I'm gonna get a I'm gonna use precision strike on this one and get a 27 to hit that is hey I wanted to make sure and that one he only takes 15 damage cool are you at using action surge to do all this or those are just my two attacks but you use your main action this turn to use your dimension door no I use that extra one they use an object okay yes okay yep so yeah yeah and then so then I just start wailing on him but now I'm gonna action surge okay and now I'm gonna keep wailing so he's still is he bloody how much damage that was another fifteen fifteen he is bloody I crit him again oh my god so he takes another 20 damage so you're just ripping into the loser guy just tearing into him like nothing else and I crit him again what that's like an advantage right he's on the ground yeah and I'm just wailing on ya nothing well he's very dead so you basically knock him over and him to pieces on the ground and then I stare at his friend okay his friend a grim looking man who looks somewhat familiar looks like one of the men from the Queen's group like the Queen that the the queen of Thieves grew he sees that pulls out a vial from his belt drinks it and disappears no wait he's beside me right he is beside you so he just drank oh wait but it's darn it yet says major slayer do it does not apply when you drink a potion and magic but you probably books it but do I get a opportunity with this advantage you have to be able to see somebody to make the opportunity borrow he runs off okay I accept and I'm just gonna keep hacking at the lizard man yeah Vale you're up mean double movement so I'm gonna use my so it's a because of this like in three attacks is that correct if I use it for an attack yeah and then I get a bonus section yeah you could make for attacks total uh I wanna use my bonus action for Zephyr strike okay um just really made that advantage right now based on how I'm rolling and [Music] I get so that means I get 90 feet of notes so you can catch up to I'm gonna catch up to him shoot him in the face I'm gonna try to shoot him in the face three times so I got my one with the Zephyr strike advantage was that three I had three crits one on the butt the two advantages really helped some max clusters oh oh I was just doing max damage on one dice plus my bonus and then I was rolling the second dice yeah yeah that's how I was okay so I'm max your weapon damage and then double your and then I didn't add my plus like seven again no y'all know I think he's probably gonna be pretty dead can I not kill him man can I just shoot him in the legs I with ranged attacks you can't yeah it's got to be an alias okay never mind that he's not even think about that shoot him in the knee 26 kill him immediately 17 I can raise him mister Plus that's already enough there's no kill like overkill and this is he did you shoot him once and he goes down and then you're just standing over him like basically you rush back around the back of the street as he just turns the corner he just looks back for a small moment and the shot just hits him right in the eye and he goes spinning around and splays out in the street 59 damage there 959 damage BAM and I say sorry who says I'm huh of a bad shot not you and I go up I kick him see and I can actually I kick him a couple times as I'm angry I'm like you killed my friends yeah and then uses them as a bomb yeah I'm Matt and I actually pick up his body yeah and I start dragging him towards I drain my lizard body back to Sebastian and I come out of the rubble and I'm like good job guys I played three work guys what was that I toss I'm over that then who are these people those were Queens men do we recognize the ones we got these are just no Lolo but I but the one I'm gonna tell these guys about the other dude it was an older man that was in the group it's gotta be it's um was he and he booked it I'm pretty sure that way somewhere but he took a potion and just disappeared did you do you recognize him though yeah from when we were in the pits each of them has each of the men that you took out their equipment is premium quality like the engineering on their crossbows are high-grade the studded leather armor that they're wearing is master crafted they're carrying well castle-forged steel short swords and rapiers and daggers and each of them has on their person the two that were killed each of them had two potions of healing and a potion of invisibility that they also have poison darts or poison ball they did have poison darts the they fired a total of they fired a total of four shots and one of them got away so the the lizard man has three of these poison darts hey I can go on a crossbow they are poison crossbow bolts hey or do you undo these the invisible someone hit by one of these poison darts has to make a constitution saving throw or fall unconscious it's a three there's three of them if you're taking the invisibility potion can we each have the motions of healing yeah just regular potions of feeling there's for each of them had two potions of healing yeah and one potion of invisibility talking and now we'll just give they're both the potion with visibility yeah there's so much invisibility yes because each of them each of the ones that you killed both yeah sure I mean we can always even toss me one like if we need it um and then the crossbow bolts there were yes because only the lizard one had poison crossbow bolts the other guy he did not have poisoning crossbow bolts in his in in what he had with him what he has on it on his person are it looks like his crossbow bolts are tipped with a little bit of oil so that they would light up there was the yeah right those two checking the houses that we originally you can take those but the the gas like basically the oil that that's put on them will not like boats all these things looking at them the poison on it will go bad in 24 hours music quick we use it today can I want to just bit up a lot because it's all been applied to the bolts already yeah right so once it's exposed it's not good for very long can you put them in the bag okay yes I don't know nothing rots and just hang on to them if the place goes bad it's fine but maybe you'll shoot somebody real soon yeah you know yeah we I'm really mad I need to stick it out on someone feline anger out on people we're yeah we're definitely targets now yeah it sounds like the queen of Thieves knows we're up to something and one of them got away so they're definitely gonna report back but they'll be looking for us which means seeming will help could we turn some of somebody else into us it's easier to turn us in duh no I know but can we also or no I think so yeah they got it they get to make a save my could we turn some of the Italy interns into us hmm yeah I guess if they're willing to be us which sounds really dangerous yeah it does here do you guys want to take a short rest um yeah or do we want to get back to the account yes we can like are we close to the tower you're close you you haven't even you're on the outskirts of the town you haven't even got back to the bear the Shepherd's gate yeah so exhausting yeah I would say like rather than rest here we don't know who else is gonna come our way it's true like we can't rest right in the spot that we were just attacked by Queens men they know exactly where we are wonderfully running somebody I mean two of my people there's two hooded lanterns yeah and as you guys are getting all your all your things together the third one is dead that his body's been dragged and just dumped in the basement of one of these buildings in the ground level of one of these buildings so we find em or no yeah yeah um do you think we can grab an empty carton when you look at them like they're still warm yeah I just I think they I don't want to leave them up yeah what any healing work at this point or not all of them may need like it looks like all of them were shot it looking at there at them all of them were shot with crossbow bolts which were then removed because you can like look over their bodies you can see the crossbow wound but all of their throats have been cut so it seems like they were probably hit by those poison darts and then killed you want to bring them back yeah there's a wagon race yeah that's Noble can we hook it to the wagon yeah I also have a horse do you want to use it now I don't know you can use me I don't know if you're willing to haul this cart from the back we'll push the back okay that's let's bring these bodies back okay that means it's appropriate on the carton jog along pushing this alright you bring them back it's it's only a short walk from here back to the barracks and you're able to turn over the three that fell and the the Lieutenant Commander says what happened you're ambushed on our way back and these soldiers were used as bait to bring us out their bait who ambushed you the queena thieves her men did you kill them one got away it's bad what are they how did it go down well I shot one in the face as usual I chase you through but yeah this thing out there listening the the details Lord Commander you three are going to need to tread carefully with all the trouble that you've been getting into well actually you haven't this is the first time that you've spoken to the the Lord the night our the lieutenant commander since everything else went down yeah he said he says I heard about what happened in the city yesterday who everyone heard is unfortunate and some reported it to me yeah I sent him back unfortunately they did not back down when we told them to when they felt it was their duty to take us on so the leader of the silver order here is dead silver order will probably not be in fighting us on sight and the queen of thieves has painted a target on that rear view she worked with poison she did poison and fire yeah they tried to blow us up first hmm I want our men to scout only that doesn't follow she put the explosives on our men but then she shot the poison bolts that made you unconscious to us yes but she initially tried to blow us up well she initially tried to blow and he tried to blow vayo up Vale was the blow-up target maybe she wanted one of us alive I think she wanted I think she wanted the staff she that's why they tried to she must know if badges take you out oh and you they tried to because you're wearing a badge right now yeah we were they were trying to knock us out there trying to kill veo but we all have a badge right now Vail doesn't have a badge she just has a title Oh true I think we are working on something I don't want to talk about it yet when we get back from the amethyst Academy I want to have a meeting and I want our men for now to stay out of sight as much as they can no more open patrols stay in the shadows because we can't afford to lose any more people not this way not this grimly they don't deserve that we need to head to the Academy now as soon as possible I'm ready all right okay I'll recall all of our men and have them ready here at the barracks is another strikes coming isn't it yes we need we need to move quickly we need to move silently I'm not so worried about the barracks I'm more worried about where the badges are I feel like they're gonna put more resources on us than they will on anything that's why we're going in do they gotta me well I was gonna say well there we go for the Queen we're going in underground yeah she's less likely to - I say telepathically should we should we be maybe ditching the badges no no I would keep them on us at all times even if we are the targets it keeps us I'm sorry to say but the badges are safer and with no one else you three or three of the most dangerous people in the city thank you that's nice to hear even here aside from storing them at the academy which I don't think that's a good idea entrusting them to the Academy directly we're lucky enough that we have access to the Archmage's staff but I wouldn't entrust them to anybody we have to which is good we need three to access the castle yes the men that we faced they had much nicer weapons and armour than the last time we faced the Queen's men could they have already obtained gear from the castle the queen of thieves has a lot of followers and if she's sending her best men after you then that means that she's playing this game seriously especially for her to attack so openly and directly she sent thugs after you before now she's sending assassins and that was a crafty trap it's a good lighting I spotted it yeah we really really played on played on that the old heartstrings there will have to be much more aware as we uh as we traverse the city now nowhere is safe well let's go to the academy of power I guess no we're saving from us yeah the Academy is one of the fewer safer places given how difficult it is that to access it you know we don't even know we're doing our best to keep things secure here but the potential for any sort of infiltration is still possible here at the barracks so as the circumstances are I'm keeping everyone on needs to know basis only think that's appropriate make sure to keep your eyes on those latrine tubes or your weak point also people with crafty disguises that said I wouldn't be surprised if the queen of Thieves had contacts and had resources outside the city that she's capable of calling in now she's well-connected if she's as smart as she is and she is it's possible there could be others other nobles merchants that don't even know who their who they're dealing with the queen of these has had run to plunder whatever she wishes in Drakon I'm and who knows what treasures she's found and through her contacts is sold back so the fact that they have good equipment doesn't surprise me at all tor yeah maybe well really mad at Elder I mean he's just doing this job right he just sells he's just a weapons dealer like he's just he's out to make a buck you know when you're when you're hanging out in the town and there's a war about to happen he's probably making so much Bank right now but maybe that's that's a problem for us we're not sure I'm not adding Eldora the immense to her I don't want to deal with did you see like the people that guard L door I just that's that's a head I'm saying is like maybe we could convince him to maybe we buy so much from him that he doesn't need to sell to anyone else I do have some patches filled with gems gem patches give him your coat [Music] it's just something to think about if if we're gonna be fighting on these two from picking up money do you have any yeah why yeah what do you what supplies do you need well we don't we need men we need materials and if you have money money talks I could send I we could send some of our men outside Drakon hime and hire mercenaries I don't know if that's the kind of help we want right now we're kind of fighting mercenaries no there's different types of mercenaries we need all the help we can get it's possible that we could buy the allegiance of some of the Dukes and other Lords and with a significant enough investment convince some of our of the nearby neighbors to commit men what are we thinking like ten gold twenty thirty going as high as 300 nice well if we're going on the rates of soldiers that active duty I would need two gold pieces per man per day how many days do you think it'll take you to get there we need soldiers for at least a month so sixty gold I a soldier we could recruit a sizable army six thousand gold buys us a regiment of a hundred men whoa i reaiiy open up my coat and I grab one of the patches that has a little picture of ten gems on it and I rip it off and slam a bag of gems down BAM and I'm just like this should be about a thousand gold worth of gems here you can use that excellent this will have a lot I have 350 gold that I can add do we also want magic items I mean you do you what you want you with your money we want I just have to say the enemy's prices for some of their artifacts you can buy an army don't underestimate that don't underestimate the power of an artifact I don't but in this is it it's not as cut-and-dry a decision the crown of Wes Tamar and for quite a while we've had to make this I've made these decisions before about whether to purchase equipment through the Academy to equip frontline soldiers but right now you're the three of you are very well equipped I'm your artillery so I don't know if we need many more artifacts than me but again the three of you are a fantastic strike team you can accomplish much but between you and the Academy we can't hold ground we need soldiers we need people and yes once we get control of the castle and the throne we might be well we can call in the royal decrees and we can force the allegiance but until then money talks also remember and I I agree with you but remember the caspia should be here in a matter of days as well with their men and also which cross was sending Eric and a few people there more diplomats but we're gonna have brains and brawn arriving soon I get what you're saying but that thousand gold should get us a small force right a pretty hefty force a six of what he said let's say get us started with a thousand but I need at least six thousand to bring anybody okay I'm not gonna be able to get I can't if I'm gonna send someone to do this I need I need at least that to get things going I start like reaching my pot I'm gonna bring out like the amulet and I like put it in a pile and I start plugging it like old potions I'd say before we started do you have a delirium we could sell that we don't we don't a commander we don't have to sell it to the Academy they a good rate for it but there's others that buy it we've been selling to we have contacts that we've been selling it to for years can you give us two days to think about it until we're back certainly we're coming back this way after the Academy right yes okay we're coming back here to talk it's a it's a fair trap but I think I have contacts out on the coast for the route there are others that are buying it thinks the the amethyst Academy isn't the only major guild in the world say something literally when they were taking me there lake welcome to the only major in the world they're the only ones on the continent but I have some contacts out of the port cities that have the years and farther away lands people that are interested in the Delirium people that will pay an even higher price than the Academy we're selling Delirium two places a hall over the place why not it's not contained anymore I just doing it for years okay I can handle that I I mean I was putting my trust in the amethyst Academy so hopefully other people who are are we just selling it to anybody who will buy it are we all door I mean we're selling like chemical warfare to just like that stuff does some weird things but it's it's like we're our kingdom but for Westham our I know you have good intentions but we need to hold off on that for now we also need an army we do but give us a couple days to think about it while we go to the Academy we can discuss I mean technically we sell to like this one group of people that make bombs with it so like selling each other on our side I know but it's just like oh I mean we just how do we draw lines in the sand in we know your allegiance lives with us we don't know about the whole Academy I am Master Sebastian crowd debate to be fair we sold before way before we knew we were friends we were selling we were totally ok what's true like I really want to make this clear like he's we've been doing it for a while like let's just like literally we came in here to get delirium to sell for money so that we did it like day one yeah the problem is the Academy room needs it as well but we'll think about it but for now don't tell to learn to anybody else unless you let me know about it please [Music] there isn't as much time to do that but if we give up on some of our contacts Lord Commander we're gonna run our money and we're not gonna be able to buy supplies for our soldiers if you want me to stop selling delirium that I need money to feed our troops how much you need just running the hooded lanterns but the troops that we have feeding everybody trying to give the officers a little bit of a pay I can go through the books with you but that's a lot it sounds like we might need to keep selling delirium yes I okay don't stop connect with our contacts but I would like a full rundown certainly none of this under the table stuff anymore it's gonna be a really boring day for you it unfortunately is and there better be great snacks I mean snacks costs money I've sold a fair amount of that stuff to all over the immense he supplies a lot of our gear I'm gonna turn to veio and just be like do you realize that the amount of cookies that you've had the hooded Lantern's make has cost so much yeah you guys so much of the resources has gone to snacks for very we had to sleep they probably have to double their delirium sales in order to keep you fed yeah just throwing that the per diem per day is just wildly out of proportion now do you okay okay my snacking is not a problem I don't have a problem shouldn't stop anytime she's eating right now there's like bakers putting new trays of cookies out and you've already eaten three this is her thinking cookies this is how she gets her stress see it's how to save money okay [Music] you know what we might have to make a small cut and they're going to the you know I don't want to say it aloud yeah yeah yeah you know what I mean no to basically just to just to give you a frame of reference the effectively the hooded Lantern's stronghold mm-hmm straight out of the Dungeon Master's guide it's the equivalent of a large castle and the hooded lanterns themselves are their own organization it costs about a thousand gold per day to run the hooded lanterns fun and so fortunately they have deals that are basically selling dalire like effectively that's why they brought teams up because they need scavengers and they have deals so there's a lot of that cost they don't it's not like the hood of lanterns have that in liquid currency that they can actually just spend at any given time from what you now know as Lord Commander the hooded lanterns themselves in their own vaults have probably about a week's worth of liquid currency and they were really like if you stop the the hooded lanterns we'll be out of supplies in a week okay yeah we won't do that right they Forge they work a lot for what they have but yeah it's about a thousand gold a day okay yeah all right so we stop that but I don't know about these guys you know what kind of deal we're getting and if I can use it to make the academy pay the the Alliance Drexel can maintain that and make sure that that cost is is maintained but in order to do so it's reliant on having groups of hood lanterns out scavenging through the ruins and selling Delirium to these contacts as soon as you cut that off it's so scavenge but try to go in smaller groups don't cause a lot of ruckus and stay away from any CSAC stay off the streets kids all right so head to the Academy yeah let's get there okay the journey oh yeah yeah I'm like an obvious knowing that you're going back to the Academy River is going to accompany you and she sends out to the Academy to try to contact him that you're on their way she produces the Aqua x / y and it's an unpleasant trip it's an unpleasant and uncomfortable trip but fortunately you all make it there together and the they send it a contingent of the Academy's constructs out to greet you partway through to make sure that you're protected on your way back in oh thanks guys and after it was very harrowing set of bout of vomiting and then an unseen servant hands you all towels you were met by eldritch and their remainder the rest and guided to your your chambers what would you like to do in your time here at the academy I wanna get my ring filled back up okay they let in the ring and are we staying here like tonight and then heading back because we have two days before plants so we we stay here tonight I mean everybody meets with the hooded lanterns tomorrow we spend all the next day basically arranging the plans making sure everybody knows their jobs and then on the basically when the Sun rises on the third your new goggles are ready is there a ceremony or is it just a game they bring them out in a wooden case should I go get the new while he's getting his goggles I want to go around the Academy and I want to find two spells I don't want to put in silence mm-hmm misty step okay and then I still have a shield on there okay and I think that should be in the majors double charge new goggles for survivals of true sight you're writing awesome in true in true style yeah very good very cool yeah so these are effectively a gem of scene okay they do require teaming that's fair and silence cool and shield on my ring is there anything that you want if there's any I'll give you guys two till next week to decide if there's anything else that you want to supply with we can review that next time as well are there any other preparations that you need to make during the night I'm probably going to talk to my mother again before staying out and other than that okay is there anything else that these two want to do because we want to do in preparation for for that because we could finish off with you calling mom heroes be heroes so before you guys leave the Academy you do want to have a hero's feast we're hungry okay and video needs to stop eating into the hood of entrance supply but it's only last for 24 hours right yeah we have to we're gonna eat it as we're leaving we're like eating it at the we're walking out the door like I'm having it perfect before we leave and then also so next week we're going to choose do we get our potions as well yep you can requisition your potions and oversee any other preparations that you need to do is there anything else that you wanted to take her for can I can I have like River help send my dad the the Caspian forces sent by your father will be arriving in the next cut like in time for the for the attack so you'll be able to we'll be able to meet up with them but it would what do you want to say say so I don't like call him on the road you know just see how he's doing make sure the trips going good we'll talk about traffic however though do they have to travel by land or oversea they have to travel by land okay they're there so although yeah because they've got to come up from the south okay to get to to Drakon Heim but they've used a few of the resources of the Academy as well to help this journey so they're coming with a relatively small contingent of people but you know it's it's fine and just to just to clarify I know you guys told the the rat Prince two days technically we probably need to retcon that to about seven if you want all the things like the goggles and the Cass beans to all be in place we don't do days yeah just just for the timeline sake if you want all those things to stack up together you probably got to spend about a week at down time we actually totally said seven days yeah I know you guys heard it there's an edit or anything but there was seven days can somebody just like put one of our voices and being like seven have a good sound bite seven seven okay that's fine by me just cuz cuz yeah I think I realized that they it'll be a little bit longer for those things so you guys basically do have like a week of downtime if there's anything else that you want to do before this this whole thing goes to I imagine Sebastien is just standing outside like the forge and watching his goggles being made like oh yeah cool I can't think of any guys is there anything I should be doing I was they go to amberwood village and like say bye I know my dad's at the barracks yep well we'll go see him yeah yeah yeah we're gonna say bye to and before I go maybe die alright again you may be dying on the way there yeah wonder if there's a way to send a letter to the reference just maybe diam yeah better just if you want to get the message out that they need to wait a couple more I need five more sunrises thank you so Sebastian you sparrow call up mom again yeah okay okay and we're there totally we're always I do that thing again I sit on the floor I sit on the bed we're watching and I lived into the air my eyes go black everything starts floating around me and I commune with mom do you want to listen to his thoughts yes and I and I just and I and I like listen if you get really close to the circle River give us the telepathy yeah I'm just gonna sit there into time why why why why why okay hello mom so the image of Lenna thievin Tide peers through the the mists and shadows and is fixated in your mind she says hello Sebastian does it count as a question if I ask her if she likes my goggles okay and I won't do that I've come to ask you some more questions first on my list why did you make the mirror dimension it is my private sanctum my shelter from the world and it is yours now there's a lot of scary things in there like a demon statue a fake mom that tried to kill me but the most curious of all you have a clone in there is it possible that I can wake up the clone I don't need it anymore why did you leave the Academy I wanted to have a family well but then you gave up your own life for that yeah okay should I trust the Academy he said should I trust don't know more than anyone else oh that's uh so just a blanket statement I trust some people a lot and others not at all he trusts us okay I'll keep playing it playing it by ear I hope this isn't a wasted question this is this is it's five right oh all right so this is the last one um do you know where mouse is the girl that I sent to hell do you know anything about her where where her soul is I really want to get her back but I don't know how her soul is in the clutches of a great demon one who goes by many names [Music] is that my last question do you know its name you had a statue of it in there if you well since you've got a couple extra days I'll give you some extra questions okay let's just roll the land see if you go insane yeah it's important did you go insane for 24 hours each time you there's a chance you go insane each time you cast what kind of service it's an intelligent saving throw if you go insane in your room I'm just gonna leave I got a 17 ok so you don't go and saying the first time so the second time do you go insane go insane a little bit yeah so you go insane on day 2 on day 3 - you go insane so we just leave the room for a bit while you screams into the ether 9 you go insane on day 4 on day 5 that one's good okay so so basically for three days Sebastian is just screaming in his room and although all the mages are just walking by it's like always contact me other place your neck your head well yeah one day my head's just Sebastian is not here there's no Sebastian our shoe o'clock the garbage dog there's like odd you see you don't want any you don't want any lunch or anything okay more questions do you know the demon personally or not personally do you know the demon you have a statue of it in the mirror dimension you say it goes by many names and that is the demon that's holding maps its name the demon goes by many names and I know a few of them to the elves we called him he who laughs last he is the god of death and laughter and basically his name to the to the elves is actually like he who last last and in elvish and and in elvish they would call that errand fool some also called him the many and others have called him orcas you guys were right [Music] what sort of uh why you had that statue in the mirror dimension did you commune with this demon this he who last last errand Thule yes he taught me many things right I already asked that this is one one of my insane days searches asking questions over were you trying to fix the clock tower I fell I you had there were notes by you in the clock tower no I didn't see the point in trying to actually fix it what did you want with the clock tower it was merely a curiosity do you know who the queen of thieves is no I don't all right can I can I can I ask you a question sure what what about those um those diagram things that were found in your room who made those the things that predicted the end of the world or the predicted the meteor who made those do we know that wait wait what things does he the the cleaner Oryza no like in the Archmage's yeah who made those I meant like in my room in my old house and I'm just like what okay I don't know if it can I have it I asked I asked that they well they didn't predict it they just show that it happened yeah but you can't look ahead yeah I just no but I mean it and that my bigger question is is that important can I gain any knowledge from learning about the Kosmos and orientation of the planets during the time of the meteor struck do you think there's anything to gain from that yes absolutely [Music] can you ask I mean again these are all this is you asking so you decide if this is important I think that's your five on day - no no you need that was day five buddy you got two more days - tried not going yeah you streamed for three days I don't know if you remember wait that was three days I thought there was like five minutes yeah do you want to try an or infinity it was either five minutes or infinity you know and one more question that I wanted us all right well roll it let's see if you go insane or if you get they ask five or twenty okay twenty four you gave me power that's why you said that you sacrifice yourself to give me power what did you intend for me to do with it [Music] so that we can work together which you recommend making a deal with orcas the price will be very high but it might be worth it when I tried to make a deal with him he said that my soul was claimed by another do you know who claims my soul I do you've been protecting my soul it's my mom she can use my soul girl now on weekends two more questions left it's the clock tower linked to the meteor to your knowledge I doubt it and my last question do you like my new goggles just I just need some approval I just want you to tell me I'm beautiful I think you look great I don't like that tone and she starts to fade you'll always be beautiful to me now can you detect my thoughts he loves your new goggles yeah if you can't detect my thoughts I'll tell you do you like them or do you love them I really like them like like like well I think that's where we need to do it really for the day because the the last day is coming and unless you want to risk going insane on the day that you'd planned no that's that's love that you spent three days insane I I wanna like no I'm gonna make like a list somewhere of all the things that I did during those three days locked in my room you guys had to leave yeah and and it was by choice right when you guys came back there was like everything was everywhere there was like the bed was on the ceiling somehow I was crawling on all fours on the walls I imagine he'd written on the walls with crayon and is like drawing pictures of himself hanging out with his mom on the third day of consecutive insanity though it changed from crayon to blood I like the idea that every day to wear frame from mill you don't want I don't even know I like one I picture one day you meet like a bunch of little ships and bottles and there's like I just a million of them all over your room and then the next day that was just gone I didn't leave my room for three days there's jars of P time there was a meal vayo would come in at first useless like Sebastian do you want your okay I'll have it by the third day I would see if you're so crazy and I'm like oh no it's mine for reasons you don't understand or you can't explain by the third day I had a really long beard and it was like gray thousand lifes and then when I went back to normal I was all like yeah well thank you so much as always to our amazing cast Kelly Joe and
