Drakken I'm is no more struck by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed Wolf Aleve the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome to Drakon hein this is our weekly Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition game with the dungeon dudes that's me Dungeon Master Monty Martin and I'm Kelly McLaughlin and I'm going to be playing Sebastian croud half-elf shadow sorcerer and we're joined by our good friends Jill tinnitus playing Bayeux Sonya the tabac see gloom stalker and Joe O'Gorman playing Pluto Jackson the human battle master when last we left our heroes they had completed their travels through the sewers underneath dragon hime venturing in as one of the sole ways into the city through the walls they clamored and crawled and trudged their way through the sewer system under the guidance of the rat Prince coming upon a tribe of fish people in the sewers below our heroes pollute Oh Sebastian and Vale were led forward to a great cistern which ve√≠a recognized late what was beneath the well beneath slaughter stone square the old place of execution in the heyday of dragon heinlein fleeing in abject terror from the executioner the mechanical construct that has survived the destruction of Drakon hime and taken on a new and horrifying form the our heroes now find themselves at Market Square the south end right before the great clock tower of Dragon Hein slightly life grant drained and somewhat exhausted nightmares for weeks what do you do well Sebastian left things pretty intensely last game he had been touched by a specter it's kind of like touched by an angel but far worse and he he was he was not doing too well so he kind of curled up in a nearby wagon and took a nap to regain his senses and recover part of his soul indeed you are at the south end of the Market Square Plaza one of the largest open areas in Drakon Hyman the Market Square is divided by a high series of buildings that formed the vaults the banks and several of the guild halls that once controlled the commerce of Dragon Hyman and all around the Market Square Plaza are the ruins and remains of high town houses with storefronts out in front of each and scattered across the plaza in front of the clock tower are the remains of Drakon Himes massive open-air market the rows of stalls and canvas tents knocked over pavilions baskets crates wheelbarrows carts and corpses of those who could not flee the destruction of the city fifteen years ago it was like a snapshot frozen in time yet intermingled amongst the ruin of the Market Square are the scars of the battles that have been fought here in the intervening years scorch marks bits of armour and weapons fresher corpses although again because they don't rot it's difficult to tell which corpses have been here for 15 years and which have been here for perhaps only 15 days several rats scurry about and several crows hang above the square picking over what remains they can other crows hear a thick mist hangs in the air it is a silvery purple in color you breathe it into your lungs it is the haze you can feel the haze sapping your strength with every moment and breath that you take it has that slightly ozone like smell to it almost like a freshly struck lightning bolt mixed with a little bit of ember and burning sound kind of makes your nose tingle on the inside as you breathe it in and it sends a bit of a sharp pain once in a while down your throat if you inhale it too deeply it's unpleasant but looking up you can see the great clock tower piercing through the fog that hangs over Market Square I take a few heavy breaths after the running and I can claim that it burns listen I don't want to do any work I I have one of those moments where I wake up from my nap and I'm I feel worse okay you know when you like have a nap and it's like not the right amount of nap and you like wake up feeling even groggy ER than you did when you went to bed yeah Sebastian's feeling that I crawl out of the the wagon that I was sleeping in and I'm just like oh it smells and tastes awful in this city I don't remember it being this bad how did you live in here for so long well you know especially being so so close to my home own home the clock tower you know being above there it was above all this double nerium shiny mist so I kind of got away from it or had a spot where I could until these darn harpies took over it I suppose we should reclaim that then yeah and I start to pace back and forth a little bit nervously so um are you sure you want to face these harpies are you sure you want to face these harpies I've met a harpy that I couldn't kill how many harpies have you met I've never met a harpy true so are you having second thoughts you brought us all the way through the sewers we fought giant monsters down there you made me run yeah we outran an even bigger monster just to get here and now you're having second thoughts I just just a previous fear I have guys all right we can do this I trust that we can do it together but doesn't mean I'm not a little bit nervous about what's gonna go down are you allergic to harpies I mean yes that's why I try not to get too close to them they're there down and dander makes me sneeze a little bit when I make them explode I'll try to make sure I do it away from you happy amazing how do you make them explode okay I just look at my sword and I'll figure it out I'll find a way Oh like means what exploding harpies would be worse the allergies so love to see that well you'll have to come up with a good plan for dealing with all those harpies that have taken over the tower for it's a very imposing building you remember the inside of it well Aveo the clock tower stands almost a hundred and eighty feet tall and as you recall the interior levels form about five galleries each about thirty feet high where they reach up the top one of the topmost levels or the great bells of the clock tower once stood now of course the above that machinery and above that the airy where was once your sanctuary the clock tower of Drakon higham is one of the city's most ancient and well-loved structures for this is no ordinary clock that tells time the clock tells not only the time and the date and the year but it tells the position of the material plane it's the location of the spheres and all the various planets celestial bodies and planes of existence and the relationship to each other all marked on this glorious stained glass and rotational clock face it looks like several discs of interlocking glass in multiple different colors and all across the clock face are gargoyles depicting angels demons devils elemental creatures the whole Great Wheel of the multiverse laid out and frozen in time for the clock tower has not functioned in over a hundred and eleven years and it is frozen on that last day the 11th day of Frost fall the last time stopped working the last time it was working rather so in our lifetime we've never seen this clock down we're working never its bells have never run after the clock tower stopped working people said no one knew how to fix it or no one had the wherewithal to fix it and over time the various cathedrals and churches all throughout Drakon Hine replaced the singular course of the clock tower with their ringing bells the clock tower has been silent and largely abandoned for decades so you were you were driven out of here by a few harpies for you like what are we saying like three five even more I don't know how many have joined them since they drove me out but there was a handful do harpies lay eggs they like all right the Monster Hunter who I'm gonna consult my guidebook and it's just inside my armor I've just written harpies do they lay eggs question question question right and there's several strange drawings where you postulate how that might be possible it's a it's a heartbeat laying an egg and then a heartbeat birthing and it's and I'm just it's a conundrum I really what's what's your verdict Pluto I guess I'm just gonna have to find out first question when we get in there do you lay eggs can we eat her Peas I've got a taste for monster flesh I would eat the harpy eggs the Psalms and it's not a question of can you join you also ate or will I also it's just remembered and cooked up a fish person so the clock tower itself as I said it's a hundred and eighty feet tall and the front facade of it is a mechanical wonder of stained glass facades so circular plates that reveal the date time and the position of the planes and planets and elegant carved gargoyles depicting the Angels the Saints demons devils and various creatures that inhabit the multiverse of the world what will you do what plane is it stuck on just out of curiosity do you have knowledge of the plans yes I well I took a lot of elective courses as you know like masonry and I studied celestial and infernal they were it wasn't my choice but my dad made me do it and now I know them to it does that does that help my what I've come across it seemed like the marker is stuck between two planes between pandemonium and limbo oh yeah panda and Lim as I called them during my courses during my to tell us that you look up at the clock sorry like stuck between panda and lamb and we're like looks like it's like it looks like it's dark um what do I hear I'm listen for sounds of harpies you hear very little at first but then there seems to be almost like a chiming in the air and as soft humming like someone is singing a lullaby or about it it's actually rather soothing and comforting music to your ears yeah sounds really really nice it's rigged or giuse you can hear it more and more in your ears pollito you as well start to hear what another voice joining in this ethereal echoing feminine voices singing on the wind resonating from the Clocktower they are you here too you recognize these voices heard some singing before around here would necessarily trust it I never trust singing I've never trusted a thing the music grows louder you hear the singing very prominently singing in a strange language but it almost feels like you're being lulled or lured into a sense of good you can all make a wisdom saving throw Oh I know this is a saving throw not mobility check because you're still exhausted [Music] 18 18 I'm gonna give you one guesses what I got 18 okay you feel this pull for a moment drawing you towards the clock tower but you shake your head music is still there but whatever was whatever intoxicating elements that that music was trying to hold over you you all managed to shake off what will you do I don't like this band I'm gonna go in do you guys sort front door just yeah kick open the door Pluto Jackson is the door already kicked over the dough should definitely go first the front of the clock tower is a short set of stairs leading to a large set of oaken doors which are both closed okay Baio Pro huddle I promised you that I would help you retake your your camp tree fort yeah I don't know yeah home base home base and that's what we're here to do and I know you have your reservations but we're going harpy killing today yes we're happy hunting what do you guys think is this a guns blazing scenario or are we just gonna walk in there say hey harpies and then start shooting fire bolts and arrows or are we gonna do we have a plan or is that the plan my hope is that I can herpes fly yes okay well I'm kind of screwed then so we should have replied okay there's stairs I can throw my sword at them right I can yes trust me they'll come after to scratch your eyes out okay he'll get close there then let's go okay you've got your back Pluto so much cake all right Ludo you move up to the doors and push them open there's a loud echoing creak as the light spills in from the city into the hall beyond which itself is well lit you can see in the room is a beautiful marbled hall there are several great pillars on each side of the clock tower that rise up into tiered galleries all climbing all the way up almost a hundred and twenty feet before you can see high above the bells of the clock tower but also bells well below because as the light comes into this room you can see a pile of rubble strewn across the floor of the ground level the floor the marble floor here the mosaic is cracked it deeply because two of the bells have crashed down to the floor and long ago and they're covered in a thick layer of dust it seems that as they tumbled down they collided with several of the gallery levels and as you go up the tiers of the four galleries they are part parts of them are broken away where the belt the church bells have crashed in to it do I remember it being like this when I was here yes okay the bells have been done yet about the bells were like this well before you or wherever here and no one bothered and no one's cleaned up the rebel in the intervening period since so the gallery inside are covered with painted frescoes and each level looking up you can see that it starts out in the lower planes and there are paintings on the walls depicting fiery infernos demon faces and various chaotic creatures and as it rises all the way up to the top the frescoes shift featuring images of the mortal worlds and then high above the heavens above they definitely need a new interior decorator in here just say yeah it looks like whoever was in charge of keeping this place clean did a very poor job there is a set there is a set of stairs leading up along the side and each level goes up each level goes up by about 25 30 feet well Pluto I need you I need you forward after you before you go in I recommend maybe stay to the edges of the walls mmm because you know the harpies have a lot of you know space where they can come down so you know let's not make it too easy for them are we announcing our presence I mean we did just kind of creak open a large door did it it made a lot of sound didn't it absolutely did they probably already know we're here to be honest I am I walk forth into the main floor and I look up and I see I guess everything that you just described and I say hello my name's Sebastian Crowe and we've come to reclaim this place as you stepped into the halls you could still hear the music and the singing and as you say those words it abruptly stops don't stop on account of me continue singing and we're just here to talk place yourselves in the clock tower I'm like slunk against the wall because I know I push past you guys hello hello I sebastian's although he occasionally likes to be stealthy if if we've agreed to go in guns blazing he's gonna come in and make his presence known is it well-lit you said looking up most of the light here is coming from the large stained glass windows in the upper tiers and because the rest of the Hall is made of marble the light just reflects all through and down illuminating the entire place the only areas of shadow are caused by the pillars in the corner and your vision is mostly obscured of the upper levels by the fact that you're looking all the way up at the galleries so you can kind of see if there's anyone on the second level but someone on the third or fourth gallery levels could easily be just laying down or even standing up and you wouldn't be able to see them from the lower portions these are like trying to look up at a balcony when you're standing underneath it yeah cuz each level is is a base each gallery level is basically a balcony okay so that rings all the way around in each level my nose starts to run a little bit because I can tell they're here yes no my nose is running is allergies no anything and you can hear a voice come up from above it says the mangy cats brought some friends with her this time and another voice says oh she's brought us men sisters what should we do with them and a third voice comes and says what kind of fun could we have from them shall we tear them to pieces throw them from the top of the belfry or maybe we could keep them for a while and have some extra fun and torture them all of them is fluttering you see a fluttering fluttering wings and several feathers start to fall down from up above as voices call from one each other to one to the other in the gallery saying what shall we do with them sisters the cat has brought us men folk shall we tear them limb from limb throw them off the top of the tower or maybe keep them and strip the flesh from their bones you see the fluttering and hear the fluttering of their wings as feathers fall down the tower how about I reach up and I pluck one of the feathers and I take a look at it what's it what's it look like it is a brown black and white horse feather and as you look upon it these you can see a large figure claps down on the balcony ahead of you she has long limbs that are too thin to be human and slightly too long as well they're slightly scaled at the edges of her arms and legs and they end in bird-like talons as she perches on the edge of the balcony gallery looking forward you can see her face is human-like but her features are sharp and bird-like with almost a hook like nose and large eyebrow ridges that form eyes that are just slightly too large she is wearing what looks like a combination of leather armor and a woman's green dress and she looks down at you stares at the stairs that three of you and says the cats come back we're going to make you pay for daring to come here again cat listen this is my my place first so I brought reinforcements to help me out right guys yeah yeah yeah another bird-like figure lands on the balcony up to the north looking down she has a mane of black hair that hangs around her face her wings are completely black as well aside from white tips on the edges also with the bird-like claws and then a third lands on the opposite side he says and they look at each other they look back they're kind of like that avian sort of manner very sharp quick movements and one of them for a moment she perks back up and her head and then back down again and you can see that she has almost all like features like this domain of brown feathers around her head they looked at they look down at you and they said and they say almost in unison and then in a singing voice we're going to tear you apart now that's no way to start a conversation but it is a great way to start a combat guys my Harley didn't work I don't like right understanding anymore told you they're nasty I could at least like get a few words in you did and I'm here to reclaim we've come to reclaim this place Sebastian what you got 17 now 21 gluto - it's okay polluter I just really like the music and I'm I'm enjoying the pageantry okay inner tower so just so we can explain a few things we're gonna have to this is a multi-tiered dwarven horde bill so we're gonna have to explain a few things so you can see what's happening [Music] oh my just like the other ones just like other arches oh man there you go Oh one on either on each edge we can use these ones the third one so you can see how the groove you can see how it rises up I think we'll raise the camera up a little bit to soar our streamers can see it too I hope that gives everyone a good view of what this looks like oh man yeah so this is and this continues up five more five times total so each level is about 30 feet over the next one so the three harpies are up on the second level like that is it a good view further and each of these arches are where the stained glass windows are mm-hmm yeah it's a pretty cool cool view for up above but this gives you an idea of what it looks like what we'll do is we'll take off the upper level and we'll just put it to the side because right now everyone's on the ground floor fantastic that's okay yeah angel felt soup no Jose got it yeah Joe will do the repairs for us oh yeah with my one initiative I have plenty of time to repair the foundation okay so we go to the top Vale you got 3 harpies one on each bow a balcony at level all right what will you do I want to get to a semi safe spot so I am going to use my my feline agility cuz I'm gonna be quick about it I'm gonna race towards the stairs okay and I'm gonna about half way I'm gonna aim towards the harpy that is directly across from me so if I come over here about half way how far can you move I can move I've moved you 30 80 feet right now so I've moved you 30 and then you're taking your shot okay and then I'm gonna take my two shots with dread ambusher at this harpy okay so my first shot with my longbow 15 to hit that is a solid shot even though she's above you and on the balcony you managed to land a solid shot rate in her side amazing so twenty-five damage okay so this is the owl like harpy on on the far side so as you rush across firing the shot it goes right through her and there's a gout of blood that sprays on the stained glass window behind her and she is bloodied poor window too beautiful to have harpy blood all over it and then I get my second shot with my dread ambusher don't shoot the window shoot the harpy and I get a 19-2 hits the follow-up shot hits yes so as she reels back she plunges forward and the second shot gets her rate through the eye and she collapses forward falling 30 feet and lands with a splat like a bird slamming against the front of a Mack truck on the stone floor which one was it the far yeah yeah the opposite one and I feel just she's very favored that you know I killed the harpy all on my own being so scared of them from before and I take the rest of my movements to hide behind this you know big column as much as I can away from because I'm still scared this is how that one's okay now that I've killed one of their sisters and you hear one of the harpies cry out Sara no and we move over to Sebastian [Laughter] Sebastian stares to him the other two and then just kind of smiles and holds up his hand and says lights out and then snaps his finger and he goes into a ball of darkness do did you go using to sorcery points so I can see within it okay and then I move towards the middle ish of the room so a rippling field of darkness engulfs the center of the clock tower it's your action to cast that would you like to do anything else's turn no that's it okay there is a cavalcade of flying wings that sound from above as to as the two harpies on the upper balcony swoop down towards Vale no both of them swooped down from the upper levels and come right down over to attack in Vale and they say you killed our sister will kill you you will tear you apart make a coat out of you cat and then lashes you with their claws getting and the first one she gets a critical hit and a sixteen versus your AC okay so she comes down and rakes across your back as a sycamore pillar turn around and she swoops down right behind you takes her claw slashes right down your back and across your spine and you take 12 points of slashing damage and then she grabs you by the back of the head and pulls you back raking across you take another six slashing damage and then her sister swoops down from the front and completely goes wide with her attack so the first one basically is pulling your you're pulling the head of your hair pulling your hood back and the second once where your head was so the the first actually by the way that she hold and ripped you ripped at you cause her sisters attacks to miss oh but that's still a bunch of serious ones as they swoop down you see Pluto there's more fluttering feathers coming down from above and there's more screeching - there's more than just these 3 harpies in this tower oh we got covered a what will you do Pluto I'm going to dash through the darkness and I'm going to how far how far there you if you are using the - auction yeah you can get there I'm there I get to there okay and I'm gonna slam the harpy in the back with with my shield and I'm gonna drive her to the ground all righty go for it 24 so you - through the darkness raise your shield up and slam it in the back of the harpy and she smashes against the wall a bit of the fresco and plaster crumbles off are you knocking you're prone or pushing her okay she's knocked prone it's my turn we go to the top of the round with Vail all right well I'm getting hecka doodle out of there so I cast as my bonus action Zephyr strike okay which gives me no opportunity attacks and I'm going to I'm actually gonna run up the stairs okay so needed an acrobatics check as you clamor over top of the the knocked prone harpy okay 22 okay so you leap over her and she's kind of struggling but with Zephyr strike you're increased speed you managed to barrel up the stairs which are quite steep on to the second level do it like a dog running up the stairs or a cat like all four paws on the stairs even taken any chances nice as you as you rise up you can spy there is a fourth harpy on the gallery a second level above and I can see them you can see her yeah you can still see down the stairs you can still see the other two harpies as well I'm actually gonna point down the stairs then and take a shot at the harpy that slashed me in the back okay so normally because she's prone I give you disadvantage on the ranged attack but because you're elevated and she sprawled out on the ground I'm gonna say that it's just a regular shot right she's kind of laid out she's struggling around to get to her feet so it will give it will say the advantage of the high ground against the disadvantage of the fact that she's prone and then with my Zephyr strike I do get advantage on one attack do you want me just advantage cancel each other out yeah I'll take a regular and that's a 10 it's a 10 the bolt lands just between her her wing and her head Oh too much sprawling feathers for me to get alright that's my go nice Sebastian you're next alright from within my darkness I'm going to just gonna cast a this one sprawled on the ground who can I see this one yes but she has cover what if I move if you move you need to be on the other side of the pillar okay yep so this rippling shroud of darkness III move over and I am going to cast can I see the the third one up above or is it too high for me you can just make her out I would give her plus five to her AC she's almost got three quarters she's got three quarters cover I'm gonna cast scorching ray okay and at first I'm gonna target this one in front of me sure now I get advantage and I also have elven accuracy okay so the first one is a 20-something from the darkness comes a beam of fiery energy which strikes her in the back you can smell kind of like this burned chicken smell in the air mmm delicious that is for seven damage okay I fire again mm-hmm sixteen that still strikes her good that is Aaron is 11 there it is okay the two fiery rays strike her Senate is sending scorched feathers flying through the air but she's still standing I point one last finger at her zap and zapper goes chicken wings anybody wants some roast bird I get a 24 24 that hits yeah nine more then she is bloodied but alive that's what I wanted perfect and I slink away okay the harpies reeling from the fiery rays that tore through her feathers the harpy that crit vayo beats her wings sends herself aloft and flies up to the second level coming face-to-face with veil again and she flies up onto onto the level rate flying rate above them which one wasn't that one right there that you're that you shot and as she does so she slashes down at veo and lands perching on the second level just in front of the stained glass though she gets a 15 and a 21 against Geraci yep both hits both hit you take another 12 points of damage as she rakes her claws against you and she says your friends might burn me you might have killed my sister but I'm going to tear you apart awful mangy cat [Music] no no the second harpie leaps to her feet spending half of her movement and she takes the disengage action and she flies right past you pollute Oh onto the balcony the balcony above so because I'm a sentinel uh-oh oh I'm still gonna smoke her okay fourteen that hits which actually stops her movement doesn't it yeah so she flies above you and you stab her in the thigh and she trips and tumbles down to the ground she's able to scurry to her feet but she takes eleven damage stay down she's still down there it's your turn Pulido skewered bird now she like flies up and you pull her right back down to the ground driving her down with your blade what do you do I remove the blade and then I enter it in again getting a 17 with my precision strike that is a hit for 13 damage she's bloody and I'm gonna use my bonus action again and with a 10 I attend strength or yeah yeah that does not knock her pronged okay so III I start I'm just like engaging with her with my shield yeah you've got this mangy bird vulture like fluttering in your face she is just heron tore deep gashes in you you bits of fur in her claws what are you gonna do so still a first-rate going and I still want to get away from her okay so I'm gonna run back down the stairs like obviously this was not the right route and I want to get behind that pillar again [Laughter] I'm gonna moving to get to because on my action I do want to take a potion okay yep good call so I just hear behind me this cat running up and down the stairs that's midnight yeah cats at midnight running up and down the stairs they can't decide whether they want to be inside or outside I just let you out what's happening behind me what's happening you guys get ten back for any lotion oh okay Sebastian we're over to you I am going to run so that day I was in my darkness and I'm gonna blast the one that that I blasted before but this time just with a fire bolt okay I really want that roast version she is way up on the second level you actually don't have line of sight oh the one that uh that that was not the one that you shot before that's the meters not the right time she's supposed to be up top on the second okay you'd actually have to be up the stairs part way to see her then I will shoot the one that Pluto is fighting okay haha cook another chicken 17 hits and that is for damaged turkey giblets for dinner he's still still kicking that's it for me okay some more harpies come fluttering down no this is why I was so afraid I have one more okay all right guys this is fine so a fourth harpy dives down from above and almost like a dive bomb attacks it comes to skewer pollute oh [Music] she gets 22 on our first clawback and 18 on her second the second one misses she shows she comes down rakes her claw across the front of you takes six points of slashing damage and as as she does so she she then tries to fly back away but ten feet away uhh I'm gonna hit her okay go for it 24 gotta end damage okay so I I go clever girl and she and then as is you pull her back she turns to the wounded one and says get out of here sister and the other one that you've been fighting flies away now that your reactions been used and two dashes eighty feet back up into the air and another and the other harpy the first one she flies right back up and you can see two more harpies fly down and they're both on this the second level of the gallery those two harpies are up on the third level the first two wounded what these these two are on the second yeah yeah new fresh harpies because the wounded are running away and that's our mo is letting them get away all the time I mean they can fly we can't you know it's your turn they can fly they can fly this one can't and I'm gonna make her pay for it ten to hit yeah that is a miss and that was with precision miserable attack you make one of the Columbia clumsiest attacks and she as she flutters back kind of like you're wrestling and struggling with her as the her sister flew away she stares at you with her bloodshot yellow eyes and tackles and screeches in your face I it was because I was singing I was I wasn't focused on my attack but I'm still gonna smote her with my shield get smoked smote she is smote ich ich moated give me 15 that will hit ya be sure I'm gonna knock her prone okay so I missed with the attack but I but you managed to piss hammer down on the ground okay we're gonna top in the round with Vale alright so I see Pluto struggling with this harpy down do I see any of the other herpes the other harpies you would need to come out from under under here to see them two of them are flying back up towards the top but I can't see them mm-hmm okay I'm just gonna take a shot at the harpy that Pluto has okay fifteen that's a hit nineteen damage no no she said she is very bloodied as your shot clips through part of part of her wing ascending feathers and blood spilling across the marble floor and I stay where I am Sebastian yells out to his two teammates if you guys could please group them together it makes it much easier for me with all this fluttering around I'm having a really hard time and then I shoot the one that Pluto's fighting with a fire boat because it's prone I'm guessing it's just normal attack 22 that hits yeah here we go here we go four come on I'm holding it down while you guys Pelt two or three with me you scorch her lightly but she still lives she's got arrows and fire hitting her and I'm just holding her down with my chute back to the harpies more Street Raptors of the sky the the next two harpies flutter down and the three of them say flutter down rate in front of polute oh three of them all screaming out in unison saying and as the first one says the first one that you've been wounded she says Regina Gretchen you need to help me I need to get out of here and they say don't worry Karen we'll help you you really gunk this one up didn't you you always need help from us and they fly down and the two of them both Gretchen and Regina both rip into you gluto it's Regina Regina Regina she gets a 19 and a 21 both it it's gonna be 12 slashing damage and Gretchen gets a crit and a 12 okay so the 12 misses but I think the crit heads for a big old 12 points of slashing damage so Jeana and Gretchen fly down from above I'm just getting involved and they maul you and they're actually pulling you at your arms like trying to rip you in half and as they do so Caryn starts trying to like crawl away and she tries to fly and disengage to get away so did I already use my reaction no you seven no your actions reset then I'm gonna I'm gonna Oh buddy I'm swinging at Karen okay she ain't getting away 23 that hits for it attending so Regina and Gretchen fly down they start ripping at you and thinking you're distracted Garen tries to get away and you just kind of break out of the grip of Regina and Gretchen enough to take your sword and bisect yeah friggin Kari carving her like a turkey [Laughter] Happy Thanksgiving that's Pluto's life happy Thanksgiving we can edit it we can get that in post yeah we can fix that we'll fix in post who wants the dark meat okay yeah you can have it and no anyway and speaking of which it is your turn pollute Oh being mauled by harpies wasn't on the itinerary for the moment are you sure I go have another good turkey or Jurassic Park line so I'm just gonna hum and I chritmas stop singing while fighting it you're Pluto like swinging a sword singing like theme songs and I'm like Pluto focus it's the songs it's it's they're getting in my head I'm getting distracted all the music of the harpy yeah the harvester humming the theme to Jurassic Park it's it's it's mine it's just do I copy and I'm gonna use my bonus section this time to second wind okay and stand my ground against what are they in it where do their names right now and once Regina and Gretchen Jeana Gretchen like 14 okay sounds good go to the top with Vale they're on the ground now I take a shot at Gretchen none for Gretchen 15 that is a hit you come around the corner Gretchen 19 dammit which leaves her bloody yeah didn't you sweet joy that big we're all trying so hard for one line tough guys anything else man Sebastian in the darkness Sebastian is going to come around this side here I got that darkness is that I get engulfed in darkness you get engulfed in darkness and so do they and then I yell my name is Sebastian Crowe and I'm about to set you on fire they both fail their next good does this flame might come in front of me like as you can only feel it you can't see it cuz he's walked out with the darkness it just gets really really warm in front of you and also they don't know like when I say I'm about to set them on fire they're probably like who said that they just feel a flame that's good 16 damage to both of them you hear this like noise I can see in the darkness I guess oh no you can't I can uh you you've got a roast chicken dinner right in front of you is this Gretchen yeah yep anybody order hot wings okay that's it for my turkey all right seeing the darkness enveloped drum rolls baby as darkness overtakes thing the area Regina flies out in the air and because you can't see in the darkness you can't take your reaction to attack I'm trying to help ban tough flies right back up out of the darkness and the other harpies have fluttered up the up the stairs as well have you I think you've killed three of them I think so yeah job well done not a scratch on me how did you guys fare what are you I'm gonna pursue up the stairs wait I'm in the darkness can i you can just smell the smell of burnt poultry do I know I know I didn't get a shot at her but what I you know that you felt in her her fluttering away okay I'm gonna feel around in the dark like like when you're looking for the light I'm gonna try to find the stairs you do I'll say it cost you an extra five feet okay and then I'm gonna start [¬†__¬†] it up the stairs okay you do a Jew rush up the stairs you can see that the three wounded harpies have all taken to the highest level the Regina is halfway up but the other two harpies it looks like they're up in the rafters with the bells you can hear the sound of clanging chains like and as you look up they might be fiddling with the chains that are holding some of the bells in place how far are they they're at the top of this this section of the tower which would be about a hundred and forty feet out can you throw your sword 140 feet I challenge you I can dream so the end there's no one closer right the one that flew away from you God she's on the third level up I'm gonna use my whole movement to get up the stairs and onto the balcony and I'm gonna I'm gonna as I look up and then go back against the against the wall okay and I'm gonna yell to my comrades in the darkness come on we've got them on the run okay okay it's it's a hunting season it's we understand you know you're up all right I means double my movement so I'm gonna go actually straight out into the center mm-hmm and I want to look up with my bow okay in the center of the room itself you do you can see two of the Harvey's up in the rafters I'm gonna aim at one of them straight up with your longbow great so you that's actually within the range of the bow okay take the shot six your arrow sings straight up and hits one of the bells and it goes twanging and sends the whole bell sound reverberating through the entire area okay and then I run back where I was before back towards getting away it's dirty yep Sebastian what are you gonna do I head up the stairs okay that's your movement you want to do anything with your regular action am i able to see can I see any of the harpies you can see one of the one of the harpies that would be Regina you'd be able to see her from here yeah she's only 80 feet up so that is within range of fireball I'm going to fire bolt her okay with advantage viable he's fine and we'll reroll one of those Alvin accuracy and 22 that is a hit 8 damage nice on Regina George she is quite bloody but it's still alive ok at the top of the round speaking of being hit by a large object there's a large crack as one of the beams in the belfry cracks and you can you hear this sound of a slinking chain as a chain comes falling all the way down to the middle of the building and then there is a tumbling Gong noise as one of the bells is detached from up above by the two harpies and it comes crashing down song song song as it smashes into the side they kind of as it collapses the the two harpies try to swing it on the rope down towards the staircase where you're at so I'm gonna make an attack roll and see if they're able to to aim this thing at you guys it's coming towards you I needed who's in the immediate vicinity of that staircase so I'm up at the top of the staircase ok so I would be over on this side against the wall okay Sebastian and pollute Oh both of you need to make dexterity saving throats as this giant massive Bell comes crashing down from above crash smash Sebastian would you get 20 gluto can I can I invoke my shield master evasion yes you use my shield to try to help help not oh no no I got like a six okay so the two of you both have to dive out of the way but you decided to take the brunt of it on your sheet on your shield the Bell crashes into the balcony on the on this side almost entirely annihilated the staircase Sebastian you leap out of the way and you can move up to ten feet in any direction but Sebastian you still take eight points of bludgeoning damage can i leap upwards I'd like grab if you want to do that give me an acrobatics check-in and if you fail you'll have to make the saving throw against the damage again ultra sleep off the stairs okay so you leap off the stairs as the bow of the bell collides with it mace masonry debris go flying everywhere in Pluto Jackson you take 13 points a bludgeoning damage Wow and this staircase is destroyed is it's basically rubble down yep you can just knock over all the pieces yeah there's a couple more bells up there so you guys gluto it's your turn I'm gonna say that you're also knocked groan how it damaged or the stairs there totaled oh my god so I'm separated now from these two little can you throw a rope to held or something I'm gonna stand up okay and when Sebastian and you can hear the harpies cackling up and yells for the Rope I'm gonna do just that and you hear you hear the harpy saying keep an eye on the clock actually I'm gonna stand up and would throwing down a rope and tying it off be my action yes if I get hit by one more bell don't I'm gonna just stand up and take a moment and drink a health potion or okay so you're gonna lower the rope hold on to the other end and drink a healing potion can I do that yes that's okay okay okay it's cool it's one-handed veo where's her Gina she is currently a hundred feet in the midair so she's about halfway up but mid yeah I could fight people my head out so I want to move the first two harpies Morgan and Natasha are way up in the belfry messing with the bells okay moving towards the edge yep okay and then I take a shot at Regina at Regina okay are you in my darkness does she get advantage sure that is a 13 that hits up a BAM Regina and that's a 17 damage your arrow hits her rate in the middle of the butt and she comes tumbling down as her tail feathers are blown out completely and crashes and lands right on her head with a loud thwack nice it's very messy and then I moved 15 feet back behind sighing trust in those bells and the bells sweet Sebastian Europe Sebastian stands up and he says stairs were a bad choice and he also looks up at Pluto and says I'm not very good at climbing and then ties the rope around him so that Pluto can pull him up and then I look up can I see are they like there in the rafters yes they are if you want to tie the rope around yourself you can tie it snugly with an action or you can just kind of loop it around your arm lightly I'll loop it around my arm and and then still pull me I'm sorry I'm sorry if I do I think I'm gonna how high up are they they're a hundred and forty feet and nuts you need to be at least on the second level to be able to shoot than the fire bolt okay I'm gonna just attempt to start shimmying up the rope okay the harpies you can hear the two of them playing around with the bells and there's some clanking and grinding and snapping noises and you can there's like smaller bells and some bits of gears and chain that come falling down with some feathers there's the tingling of the gears going down and you can hear the two of them say there's another surprise coming for you oh just like swing me over Pluto it's you turn I don't know I'm like hanging off or open like I don't know what to do put me somewhere I'm going to save me move backwards and pull pull Sebastian up to the edge and at the same time lower the vise from my helmet okay you pull him up he's on the second level now and I'm gonna hide in the corner so it would be that corner over there of the okay as I pull him up just this ball of darkness let's see that lets you see the second level when I turn the camera like that there we go [Music] okay so you're up on the second level the two of you that was polluters turn anything else Pluto so he's up confidently yeah I'm you know well in the same corner as you okay I'm gonna throw the rope back down okay they'll hear up so the Rope is there yeah okay sorry it's a little dark in this corner [Music] where's the rope is it near the Bell it would be hanging down yep right there okay okay um you know what I'm just gonna I'm gonna stay on the first floor guys you keep climbing I'll get there eventually I step out another 15 feet and can I see the harpy's above you can okay as I said they have covered because of the bells so they got plus two AC but you can take the shot I'm taking the shot going for it 14 that's a hit it is alright and is 17 damn hit Morgan is slain by Scott chunk and you you hear her kind of collapse against one of the bells and there's a bomb and then she falls all the way down to the bottom and there's another meaty slap as her wings and feathers go flying over ah I mean this is working for you oh yes you're also up yeah so now I'm going to move towards the staircase to the third level okay [Music] on the other side there and I'm going to look up there's still one left up there is yeah it looks [¬†__¬†] like she's gonna take a make a break for it actually but firebolt does so I'm just gonna shoot a fire bolt okay I got a 18 you got it for seven more damage she survives with two hit points okay Natasha flutters out from the rafters and you can hear a trap door slam shut as she flies above the bells we will step out of initiative now what will you do I guess my darkness can go away so I see the rope but I also take out my my grapple shot I'm like no look at this is Right see if it works I forgot is there any like exposed wood that I see on the second floor yes there's railings all around alright and I take a name shot at it and I'm like let's travel in style and I shoot it and pull myself up to the second floor okay so as I watch her like on the other side it's like I'm just standing there with holding this true yeah we both forgot that you had that or both like struggling to climb up these broken ruins and you're just like flinging around tonight Oh question can I like bring somebody with me is there just - you yes in it we wouldn't be able to take you guys up anyways so fair yeah let's climb up to the third level is there anything of interest on the second level or is this pretty much you can see that the harpies have collected in each of the corners and alcoves here there actions of bone it's a rotting meat and they've been making nests several of the stained glass windows have been have had holes broken into them and the harpies have been nesting in various spots in the galleries any eggs yes I take a harpy there are harpy eggs how big are they they are about the size of like two baseballs our baseball's are a thing in baseball it's a thing in Dragonite we establish that it's canon I pick up one of the harpy ice are our harpies inherently evil or can I raise this yeah that's what I was thinking - I'm gonna how big is it it's yeah baseball size I'm gonna I'm gonna put it in my cloak pocket okay taken with a little with a little bit of nest in there as well yeah it's keep it warm coach it's only two eggs okay if you guys want them I mean I'm I really wanted I haven't decided whether we're gonna eat it and or food or new pets I was trained as a barter like we can hold their young hostage is that evil evil evil this is dragon hi no no welcome to Dragon it's the harpies own evil just remember that evil spelled backwards is live and we all want to do that I hear in my head yeah I know use it for we're not sure yet yeah we're gonna keep them that we put up on your pocket one in my pouch all right well now that we've robbed them of their children let's head up to the third floor all right Robo testable robitussin well as you move up across the galleries as they move from frescoes of the lower plains the fires of hell and the depths of the abyss into the elemental planes of air and earth water and fire up to the third level where frescoes of the earth and the world are painted and then into the fourth and fifth where there are images of the celestial heavens above you come to the place where the bells are hung high above now three of them have been cut off three of the massive bells have come crashing down and all throughout the damage from the falling bells is quite evident but the there are many smaller bells that are hung all in place and they're all connected through ropes and chains to what look like overhanging clockwork and machinery above as you climb the various levels around the clock face on the outside of the clock tower is the massive plane or clock the orys and and the discs that all bear that the markings that show the time and the location of the planes and so whenever you go across that front part of the clock tower that face there's all the machinery and the other sides of that on the inside of the tower the rest are just galleries and as you get up to the very top level where the belfry is there is a ladder in one of the corners leading up to a trapdoor above and you can and as you can see that the trap door has been closed but the latter is still in place before we delve into the ruins again a big thank you to axe and shield for providing us with the awesome gaming accessories we use such as the awesome initiative tracker here and to tabletop audio for the great ambient music you're hearing and finally hundred years Bohr for the amazing narration in our in reduction video you're enjoying the stream and want to help support our work check out our patreon you can find it by following the links below or at patreon.com slash dungeon underscore dudes and there is an awesome contest going on right now between Adobe and Wizards of the coast as a challenge for fans of D&D to create the next official monster for the game the terror of the under mountain you can use a free demo copy of Photoshop that you can download right now at summon the terror calm and as well as a packet of assets that you can learn to Photoshop together to create your own monster and if that wasn't cool enough because that I've been using it to kind of workshop like my own monster ideas if you enter in the contest with you with your Frankenstein of a monster creation you have a chance at winning $5,000 a chance to meet the Wizards of the coast team and you get your work featured as an unpainted miniature by Wizkid's which is amazing like the idea of seeing one of my monsters sculpted as a miniature is super cool yeah so there's an awesome collection of assets so you can see that at summon the terror calm check it out because the contest ends really soon in just the next couple days so as we delve back into the ruins before we took the break you had all ventured into the clock tower with a massive battle fought across multiple levels in the clock tower between you and a gang of harpies you managed to slay all of them except one while Morgan Natasha Sarah Cara Gretchen and Karin all lay dead at the bottom of the clock tower Regina has managed to get away or it was a Gretchen no Gretchen and Regina both died Karen Karen got away wasn't Karen I think it was Karen that got away yeah I'm hearing no I think I stabbed Karen when she tried yes no Karen yes Karen credit crow a I get all these mean girls confused we'll say it's Gretchen managed to get away okay yep good I like Gretchen yep killer after dropping a bell on oh yeah and so you now stand below a trapdoor to the machine works on your way to the upper levels of the clock tower the door is closed definitely grabbing a potion before it go up cuz I was like that battle nasty of the last one that I had except for I didn't kill any harpies last time upon inspection of the situation here in the clock tower it turns out that maybe my method of talking to people doesn't work very well so maybe this time I won't go walking in and asking to speak to them you know what I don't want you to get damn bird because you are my Herald and I want you to feel like you can loosen your tongue in any of these situations do you want me to walk in there and announce you the great Pluto Jackson has cometh I can do that great greats kind of understatement the average Pluto just so it's like in between or like higher maybe you can come up with another descriptive word like the the psaltery [Music] the handsome has to be is is the is the floor because all the other tears the going up it's all open so is this closed like yes what essentially above this level the bells all hang down and there's a series of gears and mechanical series of gears and machinery that are coming down out of the floor above it's a wood wooden set of rafters and then all this is the implementation to hole and mechanically operate all the bells so there's retro several rows of bells there's the four spots where the big ones were once held several of the bells have collapsed down because they were cut down or fell down in any of the Raptors that were holding them up the beams have been broken but the floor above is still intact where do you think the Gretchen went I want to look could she have gotten it chat has corrected us it is Natasha oh thank you thank you Josh they pay more attention than we do yeah where did where could Natasha have gone which she have gone up this is any place that that she could have gone if she unless she's hiding somewhere maybe inside one of the bells would be up through the trapdoor yeah harpies are known for flying away then you know hiding and coming out so I would say she's gone up but how heavy is the door the trapdoor it's a it's a lattice it's a wooden trapdoor with a metallic lattice through it as you inspect it you can see that some of the gears in the and machinery some of them are making like trying to turn and crank in place making these awful grinding noises these snapping noises as if they're trying to turn but there's things jammed in place or a gear is turning but its partner here isn't there it's like the the clock tower is still trying to work even though it isn't it's been like this ever since you can remember Vail that's nothing new do you do you like sleep in here with all this grinding and noise and yeah I mean it's either the grinding or if I'm out and about the wailing of monsters and death so I take the grinding over that a chance that this trap trap door is like a trap door I can mage him I mean if there are harpies waiting above there I wouldn't worry too much other than that you guys get ready and I will mage hand open the door and I will announce the entry of Pluto Jackson let's do it you mage hand the door open it flies open with a crash and then you can hear this as you do it pushes up and you hear this crashing noise of like that sounds like a bunch of pots and pans being knocked over and followed by a announcing the humble Pluto Jackson Thank You Harold and I'm gonna climb up the ladder okay you climb up the ladder into a display of mechanical name you can see several great machines in this room the various counter weights and gears massive pillars of machinery can reach from this level all the way up to the ceiling which is 30 feet overhead as you come up from the trapdoor oh there's another ladder that has been pushed and snapped in half leading up to another trapdoor above 30 feet in the air this room though is filled with machinery as I said before but not only that in the center of the room is a large circular dais roughly 20 feet in diameter and it looks like almost a clock face but it is several different rooms and arcane markings and various arcane crystals notably not delirium have been laid and inset around it and it forms like a big clock face in the center but each of the quadrants of it are marked like a Great Wheel and each one bears a room of a different plane of existence and then on the inside there's another realm of planes that have been marked and then in the final part is the world with the Sun and the moon rotating around it to notate the time standing right in front of it is a obelisk which is softly glowing with a red light and almost like it's trying to start up like it starts to glow and you can hear this humming over the clockwork and it goes you can feel the pulse of this magical energy radiates through the room and each time it does so every time it starts to build up some of the gears try to turn and then when it gives out it stops and the gears stop again and the next time it tries to do that again it gives out that would be the weirdest sight in the room were it not for the creatures here for scattering about the room carrying tools hammers and wrenches and other strange implements are seven very strange-looking creatures four of them look like big metal balls about two feet in diameter with long spindly legs and arms that are almost impossibly small coming out of them and the spheres all have these kind of mechanical little wings on their backs and they flitter from bits of machinery to the others each of them has a single large eye and most of them have a set of monocles that are interlocked in front of them as they flit from one piece of machinery to the other kind of picking up pieces of gears and moving them to another place and as they do so there are four there are three others each of them that looks like a block two blocks connected by an accordion in the center also with these long spindly arms and the face of one of the blocks almost looks like it's covered with flesh on the inside the metal balls also like a flesh like mouth that's surrounded by rivets and all of them are barking the the boxy ones are yelling at the spiri ones but as they yell you can hear them yelling zero zero one one zero zero one zero zero those oh and they started ringing off these zeros and ones in rapid succession as they order these spheres around who are very stressful e picking up blocks and in the center of the room just to the side of the obelisk is a third creature that looks like it was alive once it is shaped like a triangular pyramid but it is scorched and burned and its eye socket is completely burned out it looks like it had a face on each side of the pyramid but its eyes have exploded and its arm is outstretched to touch the obelisk but the whole form of it is completely scorched through and as the rest of them all try to make sense of what they're doing the the Boxee ones ordering around the sphere e ones trying to rebuild this thing in a chaotic manner do they notice me they only notice you as they try to walk past you and when you're in their way they stop and they one of them waits waits for you patiently like it's kind of like tapping in place as you're in it step out of it and then it rushes right forward I pop my head up guys it's weird but it's it's safe I've got about these guys they've been here for a couple months now you know generally if I don't get in their way they don't get in mind so you knew about these guys yeah just kind of do their thing and I pop my head into the room and I'm just like looking or in awe of this scene this is incredible what are they working on and they trying to fix the clock I actually a Sebastian climbs into the room mhm and starts like following them around like just staring at them and studying them and like watching their movements and observing where they're going and what they're doing each of them moves with machine-like precision and they all make little whirring sounds as they move and once in a while that will turn to another turn to one or the other and say 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 and they'll they'll list like a string of zeros and ones and then not at each other and either reply with 0 1 and then keep back to their work Sebastian's like taking notes and writing down sequences of zeros and ones not understanding what it means but he's he's incredibly fascinated with this scene their mouths move so quickly when they're saying the zeros and ones and they can say it it's almost they slur their words together but you can see that they they're latching on to every single word it's almost like ticking when they speak very very quickly is there any does it look like they're making progress with their work or are they repeating the same steps or are they how long do you want to observe them at least 10 minutes okay actually do have okay Sebastian wants to do that but I'm just Kelley's letting they've been working like this for months like they're probably not gonna stop anytime soon so I would say that that would be something we could come back to it observed okay well we gotta fix that let's fix this latter problem have you ever touched this obelisk have I ever touched it no did that did that guy try to touch it the pyramid guy there's so many questions excuse me circular fella I typically don't try to go near 0 1 have you ever touched this obelisk 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 don't touch the obelisk guys I don't touch glowing odd lists you know a thing touching going Ovilus okay fine I we have a job to do I'm coming back here and I'm having a conversation with all of you about your workflow zero-one what if we seven of them right yes for sphere-like ones and three cube-like ones and it looks like there was another that was a triangular pyramid but he is very dead and I just say as we start towards keep going dopey bashful sneezy sleepy happy grumpy and the one with all the zeros your doc [Laughter] everyone all right well had a head up this ladder split in half yeah we got it if only somebody had a knife only I'd take an amending spell only somebody had a grappling hook but things closed okay now so when you explain the ladder being broken is it a ladder that's separate from the trapdoor that's broken or is it like half of a ladder hanging from the top it's it's half of a ladder is hanging from the top it's one of those ladders that like cellar type ladders that would have pulled down and it looks like it was pulled down and broken and half way in the bottom part of the line so we just can't reach it so I can mage hand open the door well before we may turn open it you know how about I go up with my shot my grapple shot and entire rope yeah bottom of the ladder okay okay go grab pull myself up like okay so you grapple up you fire the rifle shot it hits the trapdoor holds you up there's very little purchased to hold on to here so give me an acrobatics check to hang on to place I'm gonna do one of those firemen getting ready to catch so you're you're able to land on one of the rafters of above and you can tie off a rope and lower it down for the others Pluto hmm you voiced me up high I start climbing on to Pluto's back so the trap door is still closed so how are you gonna open this up how you gonna do this oh right I'm like hanging on the run do we need to open that trap door I mean I'm ready for combat you're hanging under me I'm standing on your shoulders my top of the ladder what kind of hanging on like the very tip yeah okay I mean I can push it on ya no veo that this trap door leads to the airy which is the highest level of the clock tower my my room is and possibly more harpies probably like guaranteed oh do we have to take the trap door is there another entrance is there a more stained glass windows several of them are broken so you could climb out but climbing out and over the clock tower up through I would mean a hundred and fifty foot all sounds way cooler only if we fall yeah if you fall um I mean yeah I'm still I'm still pretty exhausted right now so that probably wouldn't be best but like I do have a climbing speed so I can climb but I mean yeah it's like going through the tree Aveo with your climb speed in the grapple gun you could definitely make that climb it's a question of what these two are capable well what I like is maybe you know taking a quick peek Kurumi through the windows up top see if there's anything waiting for us into this I didn't said trapdoor stealthy Scout mission I could do that and then still come potentially can I don't know if you guys can hear me how am I gonna signal you pork chops yeah y'all pork chops and like make a distraction on the other side so you can come up through oh you know I drop a pebble down the side of the mountain I drop a rock you're gonna see it I drop it in hit like on the edge of the like I was thinking if you climbed it on the edge even we could even tie a rope off to you so then if you fall I can catch you okay and then you can give like two tugs for go and one tug for no okay yeah we can do that she tugs me and go one tug me no two tugs go one tug no okay okay let's do it so I like start to like climb out the window so you smash a little bit of the stained glass looks like a stained glass portrait of Saint Teresa smash now and you are you gonna fire the grapple gunner you're gonna climb do I see anywhere where I can get purchased with the grapple gun there's some rough stone gargoyles that you could probably fire it around yes okay I'll do that okay so you fire the grapple gun goes up to the base of one of the gargoyles hanging at the next level level up and you climb your and it reels it back up you're now at the base of the stained glass window looking into the next level can I see into the window you can because there's this is one of the windows that has several holes in it that your pigeons used to use to fly in [Music] okay um so I look into the window as much as I can in the corner so that way if anything's kind of watching they don't really see much okay you look into the eerie level the the this high level of the clock tower also has high stained-glass windows in high arches and it's characterized by two locks that are up at the top of pillars one of the loss that you used to use is your bedroom the lower level is strewn with art with a collection of the supplies furniture and other knickknacks that you gather here including several the large bird cages that you'd use to keep your pigeons you can see that many of your pigeons are still there they're locked inside but patrolling around one of some of the pigeons are these large rooster like mutant birds they have no feathers except the feathers on their wings they're bald and they have thrilled stony protrusions on their heads there's two of them that are kind of looking around the pigeons and squawking and it looks like one of them might be in one of the pigeons and you can hear two voices screeching at each other and screaming sounds like two harpy like voices up on one of the loft levels that are yelling and screeching at the of each other back and forth in the harpies language and you can't see them from the window because the way the locks are you're the one of the you're actually at the window that's underneath one of the law so the base level of the law just like well you you're literally at the window that's underneath your bed yeah do I see the trap door from here you do yes and if they were to come up what would see them what would see them guys if these two voices that you hear are on your bed level your your bed was positioned right above the trap door so if someone was coming right up but you could shoot them in the face from a fast yeah it's like you could just lean it over your bed net fire right down I take the she said it's safe yet is it safe I toggle once on the rope once was go right yeah totally no no - chokes me go one took me I have to do I do the rhyme in my head about four times before I get it and I look at Sebastian I so we don't go no do you wanna slide this set up to the side and I'll bring the uppermost level [Music] [Music] [Music] slide it over let's bring up the camera so all of our friends can see okay that's my bad you are underneath the window yet and then the whole rooftop here Rises all the way up to a dome and then there's a great statue of one of the annuals on top so you know that the that there's the stained glass windows in the in the archways right and then there's the you remember that there's a ladder on the opposite side that leaves up to the loft and then you'd set a ladder across which is still in place and you suspect that the the red dot and Natasha might be talking up on your bed level you can hear their voices screeching back and forth at each other almost like bird calls you could make up broken words of common it says it's the cat she's come back she's come back what are we gonna do what are we gonna do and the the red dot you can you recognize the voice she says you girls are but you couldn't even bag a cod and two ugly men when they come up here I'm going to melt their faces okay um I how far up am I like could I climb back down you could yes I'm gonna slowly climb back down to the window where you guys are inside so here's the situation definitely a no-go because as soon as we go up there the red dots gonna melt your faces off it's probably not the best way I'm wondering though if I climb up if we can go through under the stained windows underneath I mean we're only a hundred and fifty feet above the ground what could go wrong but I think if we can tie off a rope and then you can potentially do like ice climber kinda thing yeah I mean who hears badda climbing your bada climbing I mean alternative ie what I can try to do is make it distraction and potentially lead them away from the trap door as long as you guys are willing to come up it so I was also down for after you explained the situation I could Mika after you make the distraction first I could burst through the trapdoor but I'm also down to climbing could you come up and make the distraction with like me Chan just like that illusion I can make an illusion oh that would be cool you want me to climb with you and yeah so if I go up to the top climb up hold the rope while you climb I'm not afraid of heights why mm-hmm or even just like hold like tie the rope around your waist it's just tied to the all of us sounds this sounds so good Sebastian loves it Sebastian's happy I'm yeah tie the rope off at this level at the level below that way if you do end up falling you're gonna it's gonna hurt probably but at least you won't fall down 150 feet well if they should get up there if she ties the rope to the upper window then I mean if I fall I just keep climbing up about jindo I think that works yeah that works we can always tie another rope around you at the bottom while you climb up that rope just in case you fall like being double broke there's a Jewish I mean the more ropes the better I don't really need them but I do you guys need to do anything else to repair before you take this on like how are your hit points another thing I took a potion before I'm sorry I'm gonna take the robot so should we all climb or you want me to go through the door you should go through the door after we make the distraction and we can kind of burst through the the glass what's the distraction how do I know that it stops okay and what is your distraction going to be I'm going to once I climb up there gracefully I will create a minor illusion of vayo perched on what we're probably like right in this kind of oh one of the opposite like windows the other ever pop-up it's either that or I would say can you do something like a tapping noise on the opposite window like a way I can either do it a sound or a visual visual but if it's visual are they gonna because if they're up are they gonna see it or it would a tapping noise draw their attention you can't even do like a cat noise or the sound of breaking glass on the opposite window yeah is if somebody's coming in and then they will be alerted to that and we can sneak in yeah so I'm gonna climb I'm gonna get on the ladder again okay you like push out I'm gonna sit at the edge and I'm gonna listen against the trapdoor for pork okay and Sebastian has this moment where as Vale ties the rope off and I tie the rope around myself and I step out onto the ledge and look down oh my god this is so high up this is this is really yeah where you guys go you you look down it's a beautiful sight bone you can see the entire city and as you look out to the South you can see out across the Duran River you can see the crater and your eyes go wide because you can't see the bottom of the crater I'm a giant hole in the middle of the city like piercing through to the and as I'm staring at it in like a mesmerised horror I come back to and like almost like stumble a bit and kind of grab the rope I can do this and I start start Batman okay Manning up make an athletics check I got a two okay that's a roll of a 3-1 so you immediately go out and you slip and the Rope catches you and you fall and you feel it like you think you might broken one of your ribs as you slide slide downwards and you take nine points of bludgeoning damage and you're now thirty feet below and the in the lower level can I start to pull him up yeah give me a strength jacket with disadvantage because you're exhausted I'm just twiddling my thumbs as I listen against the trapdoor you try to pull him and he's too heavy you're too tired you're trying your best and you actually feel your grip slip give me a dexterity saving throw the Rope is tied off I know it's tied off but you guys can still fall not a full way okay you managed to stay in place so Sebastian you're now hanging down and BeOS trying to pull you up but she's just not strong enough to do it and that's dang did I see him fall you would have heard him you would have heard him because he landed in the side of the building with a crack and a yell and a Yelp and and in this moment you can't you hear a voice on the other side of the trapdoor say did you hear that what are you gonna do can i this is no well I was gonna say like an i minor illusion just a blue sky so that would they look at like mirage i came to that what minor illusion it's a fire 30 feet and i'm 30 feet below where i started i'm hanging there with a broken rib and I might need a potion now as a matter of fact I suppose I'm just hanging there okay do you want to try climbing back up a little bit you can drink the potion that's fine do you want to climb back up you can climb 15 feet back up I make one more attempt to climb up okay getting a strength in athletics check that's a that's a five that's all you need to climb an on the rope up the side of this okay so do I get back to where I stuck the window you're still 15 feet down oh god no what are you gonna do yeah you can try to help him again I'm so tired yep five you try to pull him but you just lean on [¬†__¬†] just you're not strong enough to pull him up and keep yourself up yeah I'm like I'm like clinging to the wall exhausted okay polute oh you can they are what do you want to do right now Oh usually wanted to help him Polly rode you you can hear this going on I'm waiting for pork chops okay now standing fast [Music] can we continued it's gonna kill you up yep Sebastian you can spend your movement to climb back up there we go that's that's a 12 okay you climb you spend your movement to climb you want to spend your action to continue climbing or do you want to do something else I'm back at the window yes you are I get there and I'm like I made it and then I look and I just see Pluto and I'm like damn it uh I I call up today I'm like right am I still climbing okay I I I breathe in deep and I try to climb further I got a three you breathe in deep you climb as best you can but you make no progress okay I don't like to go down like I'm just like go down to the trapdoor and wait for the signal thank you I'm sorry I'm not gonna climbing I go pack in the window and untie the rope and defeated I walk back to Pluto I look at you and I'm like you know okay Heights man it's tradesies I retreat yes can you cast minor illusion I am just like alright boys get ready and I take my crossbow and I shoot at across the other stained-glass window through the hole in the window that I'm at okay at this stage I will have you all wrong initiative I got an eight and eight that was incredible I like are you I think I did let's see you survived that's what you did I'm so happy that you're not dead I had to take a potion okay bail eight Sebastian eight Vale can go first blue no 16 okay so the cockatrice will go last then Sebastian we have a three-way tie so I'm gonna do Sebastian the harpies day oh okay the red dot okay so clearly you're gonna just borrow so she's fired the shot yeah and they're they're set off at this say she yell pork chops okay so at this stage I'm gonna say no one's got surprise everyone's expecting a fight that's just the signal for you guys to start start your attack there they've been waiting for something like this to happen they heard all that mess outside Pluto so what are you gonna do I'm going to burst through the trapdoor okay and so you barge out through the trapdoor place yourself on the trapdoor I'm saying opening the trap door cost you 10 feet of movement okay okay what do I see you see right above you perched on the edge of vales loft is a fiery haired red winget harpy woman she's perched over the edge and she has a javelin in her hand and the javelin is crackling with electrical energy like she's poised to throw it straight down at me at at you fortunately though this is that our officer she doesn't have a prepared action so it but she's gonna do it on her I'm going to run underneath and the other harpies there that's Natasha so you burst through the trapdoor leave the trap door open it's still open it's cool and then I'm going to if anything so you see the - cockatrice Natasha and the red dot can I use my action to hide all the both the cockatrice have line of sight to everywhere down here so there's nothing that you can hide behind then I'm going to smacks into dodge okay the red dot she says come back here manling and she flies over on top of the windows over there and as she flies over you can see as she as she flies around she is winking in and out of space like she's flying in a blur and her wings are kicking up all this dust and her position kind of shifts and glitches out of space until she perches there on the on the opposite corner and she she eyes at you and as all the storms around it's almost like a cloud of herself and you can see her eyes begin to glow bright red and coming out of her eyes are two beams of fire that streak towards you then at the turn to death and she gets a 8 a 15 and an 8 to hit I'm scorching rays I I do like a tippy-toe dance and I dodge out of the way her although ok except the last one I take with the shield ok and she sees you dodge out of the way and then she flies back on top of the the bed that you're she loves them there you're on the you can see Vale on the opposite side of the window there um is there a ledge outside not much of one it's what you're kind of perched on right now were you coming up through the trapdoor were you on the window yeah you're on the window yeah can I see the other harpy from my pizza current position barely she's got 3/4 cover ok um then I am going to use my like d-line agility and what I want to do is I want to kind of like barrel roll through the glass window ok so I can get a better line of sight on her ok so I like kind of like roll through glass flashing everywhere glass shatters everywhere is you both and I take my shots at her ok or shot nine it bounces off the edge of the base of the other law take my second shot at her my dread ambusher and I get a sixteen the arrow hits Natasha square in the throat how much damage is it's gonna do you know to minimum 14 he only has the two hit points left from before so what happened I want to get a regna throat so I don't hear her squawking is she yeah there's not even a squawk it's just a low and it goes straight through the throat and she flies off the loft and lands on the ground with a low thud would you like to do anything else I want to go back out to the ledge that I came from out on the window okay I want to get out of this room okay so Natasha is finally slain okay Sebastian you're up Sebastian pops through the door okay with a broken rib Anissa it's gonna cost you all your movement I can't see the red dot from here no okay but I I burst through and I come face-to-face kind of leering overtop of the open hatch I see this disgusting looking chicken creature yeah and I just leathery wings I pop up and I go ooh and then I cast a fireball tatak okay which is my immediate reaction to see ya yeah burn I get 13 that's enough it hits Lu for one damage it is lightly singed you burned his eyebrows take that foul Beast okay eyebrows the cockatrice the cockatrice one flies towards pollute oh and the other leaps at Sebastian Sebastian because you're on the other side of the trapdoor I'm getting give you cover so it's gonna be plus two AC so the cockatrice attacks you with its bite getting a 18 to hit like a shield okay the other gets a 13 it gets a 13 to hit you pollute oh okay I misses as it bites down on a part of your shield part of your shield turns to stone ah at the cockatrice is bite ah I'm gonna I'm gonna repost it okay eight that is a Miss boo-boo [Music] okay so don't let it bite you you go to the top of the round with pollute oh I do that [Music] twelve that's enough yep for nine damaged nights and I'm going to hit it with my shoes to drive it away for twenty three okay you push it away we go to the red dot let's see this of Bayeux and gluto she takes her light her javelin of lightning and she throws it in a line towards you and it turns into a bolt of lightning and two of you need to make the Xterra t saving throws it's a saving throw so nice that's a 20 26 not as nice for you fail and you take 20 lightning damage and they oh you take tau and the lightning bolt crashes out then flies right back to her hand she grasps onto it that hurt I'm super I'm pretty belated okay and then she flies right back up straight up onto the loft fail you're up okay still lightning crackling through your body and you can see Pulido's just like twitching somewhat you can see my skeleton I'm gonna use my Zephyr strike to give me some extra movement and again I'm gonna come forwards out of the window I'd say beside the trapdoor for now okay and I'm gonna take a shot at the red dot okay she is under the effect of a blur spell so you do so with disadvantage so I get neutral because of my because of my - arts fifteen that hits yeah so you see just her fluttering and red eyes all distracting yeah but you land the shot yeah okay so that 22 damage yes I try to hit the red dot she succeeds your concentration check on blurred all her okay and then I run all the way through to the other side the shot leaves her bloodied yes nice shot I want to run as far as I can go alrighty again yeah nice hour right Sebastian you're up sir I'm going to cast Webb at the red dots awesome as I'm also gonna use my meta magic to quick in that spell okay so you quick in the web strands of sticky webs get shot out on to the loft level and I believe she makes the saving throughout the starter for her or is it immediately starts a turn startup return yep and since I quickened that I'm going to then once again blast this cockatrice in front of me with a fireball okay sixteen that hits later up for okay there you go every little bit helps thanks nice nice pick it away out it okay the cockatrice the cockatrice continues to leap and over the trapdoor and attack you Sebastian getting a 19-2 hit and Pluto gets a 13 against you it's still hammer animal [¬†__¬†] I'm gonna use shield again okay you block it with your shield more chips of stone shield fly off your shield nope okay we go to the top of the round with pollute oh okay I'm just gonna keep hammering this thing or do i yeah I got it okay 23 that hit hit for 8 damage it is bloodied and then I'm gonna slam it again okay but this time I'm gonna try to knock a prone for it another 23 it is not prone so as it flies up to you you slap it in the side and barrel it to the ground with your shield laying it flat out but it and anything else Pluto shields laughing I'm going to accent action surged a greater healing potion bold bold use of actions I don't want to get her gained 20 hit point lightning okay I know I was uh I'm scared okay the red dot is restrained by the webs yes he's held in place and as she thrashes against it she will aim a fire bolt with disadvantage against Sebastian getting an 11-2 hit No so from behind the spiderwebs this blurred figure sends out a bolt of flame towards Sebastian but it goes completely we go to Vail all right I'm gonna poke my head out a little bit about 15 feet and take a shot straight up okay so she's restrained which canceled the event the disadvantage so they cancel it it's a regular shot because of the angle though I am gonna give her cover right up 14 that's a hit there it is 20 damage she is extraordinarily wounded but still alive okay nice Sebastian you're up sir and she loses her concentration on blur yes so you could you see this she's gasps spouts and cries in pain from the shot of those crossbow you see the blurred images all merged back into each other and she's restrained against the web's and thrashing against them as I'm pushing the the door up against this cockatrice he's still trying to nip at me I look up at her I'm like hey red dot those those webs are flammable and I'm gonna cost fire bolt onto the webs around her honor the webs around her or at her also like setting the webs ablaze okay because the blur is gone you have advantage although with being am I in close combat with yeah so that cancels each other it's an even shot yep okay yeah that's a 25 it's a hit I do nine damage you kill the red dot yeah so you have caught the red dot I shoot the fire bolt and it it kind of just catches the webbing around her and she starts screaming as it just like cooks her and then by the time the webbing all is going all that's left is like a charred skeleton of a harpy burning the chicken take it out of the oven okay meanwhile overcooked anything else you'd like to do because we still have a pair of cockatrice this this is so mean with me now burning her to death and I'm struggling with this cockatrice can I like duck back down and close yes yeah I'll give the cockatrice an opportunity to talk with disadvantage okay which turns a crit into a 17 yeah that hits okay it's three damage and I need you to make a constitution saving throw ten you are restrained as you begin to turn to stone to stone Oh No Oh God yep you're starting to turn to stone we go to the top of the round with pollute oh so I see that no I'm gonna finish this cockatrice cockatrice cockney cockadoodle ooh one more precision strike or thirteen that hits no sorry twelve that hits twelve for thirteen damage you bisect the cockatrice yes and I'm gonna run to the door and stand on top of the closed door it's closed right yeah yep and you're gripping on the top of the ladder turning into stone it's gonna be funny so I'm just gonna make sure that he doesn't get any more bites on you don't worry okay I mean worry a little Hayley you're up I take a shot at the cockatrice okay 13:22 it is slain you shoot down the last cockatrice hatch is my hand still stone and then I run over to the latch and I open it up yeah we're gonna open the hatch ah all right Sebastian it's your turn run me over to the latch okay what are you gonna do I'm turning to stone at the end of your turn you'll have to make the saving trail you are restrained in place like holding on to the latch yeah like basically he came down the ladder and his two hands turned to stone so his his one hand is gripped on the lot like on the ledge turning to stone and he can't move it from that place it's just the one hand or both hands you can still do you can do everything normally that you need to do but you're you're you are restrained can we say it's just one hand yeah cool because if need be I might have to blow my hand off well the rest of your body is also turning to stone too I assume it's starting at the hand that's why I'm asking is it spreading it is and it's it's like coming out from your feet and like parts of your faces oh no so I can't blast there's no okay like you were gonna do like a zombie moment like God do you want to blow your own arm off well it depends I was gonna I was gonna assess my situation if it looked like it was spreading down my arm I was going to if I failed my next save I was potentially gonna blow my arm ah hold on um what do I do um I I don't know how to stop this hold on you could just okay wait my knowledge of just magic in general - I don't know what is happening to me do I know you trained in Arcana I am okay you know that the cockatrice is petrification is reversible it and it only lasts 24 hours oh okay well then yeah I won't the more pertinent danger is that if he turned to stone and this ladder isn't strong enough to hold your petrified form then some bad things might happen um am i able to open the latch back up yeah okay I open it so I come back into the room screaming attached to the door and I roll onto the floor and I like guys we might need to stay up here for a while if this doesn't go well okay and just so everyone knows I'm not being nice the the Monster Manual cockatrice petrification really does and after 24 hours because I see some people in chat accusing me of being nice but we'll see okay so I roll onto the floor so that I know I'm in a safe position well you can't be restrained so oh yeah so you're stuck here yeah right you're restrained you're stuck on this space like one of these two would have to use their like to try to grab you Pluto I need you to put me in a safe place okay I need to be in a safe place nothing else you want to do then what casting spells do anything you've got nothing in the tank you got nothing okay I'm not going illusion your hands that they're normal so how can you calm down let's roll the saving throw oh it's a constitution yeah that's a 21 you willed it away in the last moment you're like it gets a little bit working like oh I'm just gonna blow my arm off then you race to me you see me like holding like a fire bolt ready to like blast my arm up and then it starts to go away and I'm like oh thank god oh that would have been a good moment have a dice can just just disapprove just did scream that we rolled it out but good yeah you did good got it I do have a very high concentrated a stone guys I had to cover the whole time good job we killed that red dot and not a thing happen to any of us when we tell stories about this can we leave out the petrification point no you say that you were petrified with fear I was petrified with a little just bit you as you're yeah just like and I'm gone and then it like nipped my hand I'm like oh no oh no well the red dot is slain the harpies have been purged they're cockatrice pets destroyed are my pigeons your pigeons a few of them have been eaten but that your prized pigeons still live yes yes pesto Bobby and squirt my lovely things are in disarray especially on this on the other lock level because Sebastian webbed it and then burned it but you look out onto these from the stained glass windows seeing the whole lay of the city all of Drakon Heim is laid out in front of you you can see the mage tower the castle the crater Saint Salinas the grand Cathedral the river everything you have the lay of the land high above the haze you can still like there's the interesting thing is from the top the haze makes it difficult to see the lower parts of the city and the city streets themselves so only the highest buildings kind of pop up out of over top of the haze but this lets you see the landmarks and the city walls the river itself it's a fantastic vantage point and this is a safe place I imagine us standing at like one of the broken stained-glass windows and like I come forward rubbing my hand and like we're all kind of licking our wounds well maybe just me and hanging out there looking out at the sunset on another day of this the possible sunset is rain a little bit of rain starts coming in it I walked like the Sun sets on another day maybe and as you do Sebastian there is a ping in your mind the familiar voice reaches out its River hey aren't we supposed to meet soon let me know how it's ascending spell I'll let you decide what your responses next time cool yeah right before you know we start to look at the sunset there's one thing that I need to check and make sure is here yeah so I actually rush up I climb up one of these you know pillars to get to my bed and I'm kind of like looking through my sheets I kind of taught tear open the chests at the end of the bed up there and and I find my most prized possession in the world which is my father's badge I'm born he was part of the kind of elite of the city it is indeed still there yes it's a it's a little demoralizing because it's pretty obvious that the red dot has been sleeping in your bed for the past several weeks and there are bird droppings and nests like she's kind of turned it into a nest it's really disgusting all of her makeup is everywhere all her things like she was reading some trashy magazines but it is home yes I'm gonna have allergies for week sleeping news bed you know want me to just burn the bed no I'll change the sheets it's okay I'm sure I can find something fun but you know I was like I'm so glad that I found my my father's badge because it was the one thing I have left of him in the world you know to remember him by until like hold up that memory so I'm glad I found it yeah do you tell these two about it yeah so you know really be on with guys the reason I really wanted this place back is to find this piece it's badge that was my father's and it's really really means something to me because it's the only thing I have left from him and it's really you know mysterious but amazing so thank you so much for helping me get this back not a problem at all that he's a gay it's a cake we got you I have never even asked you where's your father Oh and I you know they'll get super serious like I haven't seen him since the Ganga the stark or blue sky he's the one thing I've been searching for this whole time he's the reason actually I stayed in dragon high because I know he wouldn't leave here without me but I know he's not dead he's here somewhere and I have to find him he's the only family I have but nobody's heard from him in 15 years you believe he's alive he's alive I would know if he wasn't alive he is alive then I say we help you find it amazing we can find him bail I've been searching for 15 years to find him and I haven't so any help would be amazing you just so happen to be talking to Sebastian chrome bounty hunter and mage Slayer I have a knack for tracking people down who don't want to be found awesome there are a few magical things that you found your father's badge is magical it has some potent protective powers and in fact if you want to wear it it functions as an amulet of help Oh and so whoever wears this badge has their Constitution score set to 19 and the other thing is the red dots magical spear a javelin of lightning scattered about as well I will have each of you roll me at d100 forty-five 40 fine and Pluto was urea 85 85 and Sebastian 63 okay so you find a potion of healing a ocean of climbing that's why they kept it up here and a spell scroll of major armor in addition the red dot has accumulated quite a bit of treasure and gold and you find 235 gold pieces in various coinage and a few small gemstones collected among several bones that have piled up looks like they've eaten several passers-by 35 we'll divvy it up um I mean I'll take the healing potion because I feel like one of you could do with climbing I don't really mean it I'm pretty good without it I'll take the potion again I just say courageously and I scoop it out of your hands I need it not that I need it but just in case I need it I like your clock tower but I never want to be on the outside of it again on the outside walls you know what I mean anyone and with your defeat of the red dot and the claiming of the clock tower you've all advanced to level 5 yeah congratulations so what we will do is we will wrap up here for this
