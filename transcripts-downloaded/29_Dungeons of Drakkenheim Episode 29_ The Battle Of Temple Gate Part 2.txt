wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon hybrid cottom its rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon Heim when last we left our heroes a fierce battle was underway in the outskirts of drackett Heim at temple gate where the hooded lanterns and the silver order have united alongside our heroes to assault temple gate which is currently under the control of a pack of vicious Noel's launching the might of both the silver order and the hooded lanterns our heroes flew in on the backs of Griffins with the night captain of the silver order Theodor marshal himself who then they were air dropped via teleportation onto the top level of temple gate where they slaughtered the Noles destroyed their siege weapons mounted on the top and even took out a Manticore in the process mostly it was political action but Sebastian and bayo helped yeah there was a pretty amazing fireball who threw that fireball that was probably the highlight better than Pluto stupid turn with that our heroes have cleared out the top levels of temple gate and have managed to open up the first portcullis gate of the two portcullises with the horns of the silver order sounding a cavalry charge rushing towards the gates our heroes now must get to the other gate mechanism in the southern Tower of temple gate so that the silver order can press the attack and seize the gate with this they will be able to have a much stronger hold in Drakon hime that our heroes now stand in the top level of the North Tower omits the broken bodies of a pack of knowles that you have cut down viciously the mechanism is open the gate has risen the horns and the Thunder of cavalry can be heard in the distance as the silver order charges forth time is short what are you going to do I think we we're gonna pile the stuff on top of the mechanism just to hide it yeah put a sheet over it yep nobody will notice the sheet before obstacles they have the better and then we figured we'd take some of the bigger pieces in the room and on our way out like pile them in front of the door so that we take make it yeah take longer to get in so yeah I destroy the ladder destroy the ladder yes you're gonna destroy the ladder drag one of the tables or some of the furnishings in this room and just set them in front of the door and then close the door okay is there a lock on the door there is a lock on the door and a bar but from the other side can I do I need to be able to see Mei Chen door can I leave mage hand in there with the bar in hand close the door drop the bar you could leave your mage hand there but because you can't see what you're manipulating to do even if I was holding the bar and then I leave close the door and then it just let's go it might go on how far the door has to be able to close and that would be above it within our can of check to hold it in time yeah you could because you're gonna have to remember as a door shuts all right Arkana check ten okay as you release the mage hand as the door closes you hear the clatter of the bar falling on the ground I think it worked guys I'm just perfect and like is there any keyhole on the outside there is yes I want to see if I can like tinker and like lock it with my thieves tools from the outside opposite would have I would normally to give me a thievery check with a potential compatibility these tools is just plus proficiency plus dexterity because she's proficient in 15:15 after it takes you about a minute of fiddling but you're able to close the latch nice okay the door holds I mean they might just break the door down but at least this'll that's why we put the table in front yeah uh I was bleeding a little I'm gonna drink a potion yeah okay stop the slight cut that I have I was bleeding a little bit on yeah yeah you've brought it up so you lock the door and you're smashing the ladder going up and the ladder going down we're going down first okay and then we'll break the ladder so because there's a ladder going from here to the rooftops you're smashing that one yeah and then you're going down and smashing the next ladder as well yeah so that way basically the only way back in is through falling or climbing up nothing yep so rate rate now you've locked the door and destroyed all the ways back on to this level safely aside from getting back onto the rooftop somehow yeah yes I got ropes well we'll figure it all out once we claim this tower will cross now we cross that you climb that ladder when we need it yes there we go well climb that ladder when we need it okay so you head down and pull the ladder down and smash it to pieces you are now on the next level of the low the mid level of temple gate judging by how far you've climbed down this would be the level that is on the line of the battlements of the city walls itself so this light goes over the gate this goes over the gate and because you flew in and saw that there were doors leading from these towers onto the Battlement it stands to reason that there are probably doors on this level that lead out onto the battlements of the city walls weren't there paladins though getting on the wall and then to the south yes so okay so we we want to open that door maybe well we want to open both that would be the primaries get both the doors open yeah and then but I even mean like the door onto the battlements to let the paladins end oh yeah we could do that but on the south side cuz right now we're on the world North's yeah you're in the North Tower and if we open the door we might let them know did we notice coming in that the north wall was filled with Knowles Knowles were defending both the walls yes okay so we might want to close that I mean they might already be inside we know they're in the murder roll yeah that's close the murder holes yeah and then we know we got to get up there anyways for this she said you're in the staircase shaft although it's not a staircase shaft it's a ladder shaft so the you're on the landing between the ladders and there's a door leading out to the north east into the tower proper almost exactly like it was the level above you guys want to go in let's go for it what should we stick to the plan maybe we should just focus on getting the gate open that's what we're doing at this level we can cross over top of the gate yeah okay and then get to the other side and the level yeah and open the other gate okay so we're on the right level we just have to go through but I'm worried about what's on the other side of this door I'll go first I didn't even have to yeah okay Pluto Jackson you open the door and you see a chamber that is appointed with a met all manner of barrels and several large tables you can smell the acrid scent of that acidic fluid that you saw the Noles boiling up and dumping over as you see that there are several barrels stacked up in the middle of this room that appear to be filled with that fluid some of them are leaking just a little bit and so you can see the puddles of them all across the floor it's this rather translucent sort of purpley grainy liquid everywhere there are several racks of weapons as well on this level as well there are table and a door leading over we're up above there was the machinery on the prior level here there's a door leading out into the room obsessively with the murder holes in it and another door leading out onto the battlements as well otherwise though this room appears to be deserted though you can hear the sounds of battle and you could hear sounds coming from both the walls and the next room over of something being shuffled around and almost like the clanking and clattering of weapons or armor or equipment in the next room I'm gonna go into the room mm-hmm [Music] you roll the acid into the room and then you light it on fire in what room the only thing I'm not sure because I was I was a hundred percent thinking this it's like how do we get past it after what if it blows up way more than we wanted to and destroys the gate yes I was a hundred percent thinking like let's blow up the acid but then I'm worried do we blow ourselves up like I don't know the the volume of explosion that will come from shooting you know I maybe will try with a smaller portion like a bottle size and then go up from there we'll build their way up okay I would even say as well maybe from where we came so that way nobody goes up from here regardless of what they have equipment why is that they're not able to get in this room again although we'll want to get in this room again once we've cleared that and there is another level going down as well as the ladder goes down at least once more yeah um maybe that's where everything we just let all the Paladins charge in yeah we don't want to do that I have an idea I know we're I don't think they're in yet there are knowles manning the north of the wall so why don't we open the door out to the battlements roll a barrel out i shoot the barrel i hope that there's a bunch of knowles out there and we'll see how that goes okay trial run yes because that gives away our position yeah let's let's just kill the ones in like the circular area and then we'll and then we'll cross that next ladder bridge yeah let's put a barrel just right in front of that door so if they do come in from the north battlements they spill the acid and then I have to walk through it fair yes do that okay all right one baby girl we like I'll help you Pluto like I'll see you brush take one of the barrels off and you roll it up to the doorways by the where the actual arrow slits are who's gonna open the door to the arrow slits I can make weight yeah because you're talking about the the half mystic yeah there's the there's the half moon section where all the arrow slits are so we're talking about the one that leads outside we should do okay so out on to the battlements them so yes okay put the barrel there but then I think we should just go clear out the half moon yeah okay yeah let's just go kill everything dump though dump the okay dump the stuff in there too no alrighty okay as you do so you can all roll me a d6 please oh do we spill acid on four four five okay as you sow you're gonna roll a barrel out onto the battlements just up against the door okay so that if they if anybody tries to come in we're gonna shoot the barrel okay sounds good so you roll the barrel up to the Battlement door the door to the Battlement what are you gonna do next yeah that's the ones in the murder holes to clear the rest of the murder holes or the half moon yeah half moon okay I do you want to open the door um I call Shotgun pseudo you take one side we'll take the other okay seems fair okay Eddie my bow I am gonna major in this door at the same time that Pluto kicks open on door three are you going for them the door to the murder holes over the gates or the doors over the battlements section the battlements okay go for it all right you ready open Oh on three open one two three open okay you open the doors open both at the same time and what is beyond the doors at first appear to be a group of Knowles but there's something wrong with them their fur is matted and mangy and falling out in thick patches and as they turn around and hiss at you rather than growl you can see that the one that turns around to you is missing its entire lower jaw and its eyeball is dangling out along the side of its face and its entire stomach has been spilled open and its intestines are falling out all around it it's still wielding a bow and it's been shooting out the arrow slit in front of it from a several arrows that are beside it but the amount of flesh that is left on it is just dangling from its bones and it is almost skeletal in its overall size and shape as they turn around to hiss you you can roll for initiative um there's no way that I was prepared for zombie Knowles don't you do I got it thank God for the shield that gives me advantage because I always roll like a whiner or more to start would you get so I got my total Raynaud's on 11 and 10 and one 1513 you and we did hear ones in the other room clanking clanking hey only I Clank clunk clunk clunk oh yeah they they clean my clunk you also clinked when you're trying to be quiet maybe I should have split up Jackson clinker I should do a call response with there clanking ah de mooch in there with my arrows what do we got furnished if 1513 11 eleven you Wow so Sebastian goes first this backward backward and slow off the drop a little bit a little bit okay you know dead dolls so Sebastian you see these undead Noel's as they turn to attack what will you do first I seeing them I immediately jump behind a veil and the first one through the door noticing the dismemberment and the skeletal structure of this null I immediately cast chill touch it's cool roll to hit chill it did the bone Chikara 20 that is a hit that's gonna be seven damage cool as the necrotic energy pours out from your chill touch your magic pulls the threads that are animating it and it falls to the ground in a pile nice as I do that I'm like I'm gonna make it weaker and then I just like murder it unlike it was already pretty weak and yeah I'm good Bale you're up next I'm like cautious because I see this one go down and I'm like there's gotta be more of them and I scooch up close to the door and I see one around the corner and I shoot it with my nice 417 that is a hit rekt survived from seven damage as Joe collects nine can you do less than 15 damage with this shot nope okay so you you so you pop the vertebra of its neck and that and the whole thing just drops like a puppet I move further in still exploring oh that wasn't too bad shoot the next one with 18 also a hit and then I move around one more time for the last one 15 so Sebastian opens the door up with mage hand and dis Ana de spines the first one and van just cset rushes in and just you just hear three quick shots as these creatures just have their the all of the animating force pub flown right out of their their existences I open the door and it's veil opens the door veil it was me time job we should open the doors at the same time so I imagine you open it you see the skeletal Knoll and you're just like and you just see the head of it I try I got her against the wall and then bail is just there and you're like oh can I walk back don't I say he's fashion we're tied oh okay pollito what are you gonna do I'm going to and run towards the other door mm-hmm and I'm gonna listen against the door you hear the sound of barrels being unstacked no that's blasphemy we only stack our barrels like a big barrel being lifted off and set down and the sloshing around of fluid that was like all my movement so I'm going to wait at the door and shoot a shoot you to open the door it's like a good idea well I'm just wondering what I'm gonna do if I open it could shut it again it's all the time I I'm gonna open the door okay and I am gonna have my my javelin ready beyond the door is a battle ready room you can see here the mechanisms of the gates going through so this this tall room goes right up to the rooftops and you can see the rooftop rafters overhead and you see above you all the machinery of the gate operation and you can see that raised up is the portcullis on the other side so it's been raised up in the the gable and we just the front in front end the other one you can see the top end of it in the slot in the ground the great chains holding it up and then how it gets chained up on to the other side of the mechanism that's on the level above you as well but on this level the entire floor is open up with murder holes ranging from anywhere from about six inches to about a foot in width all of them are kind of funneled so well the opening at the top is wider at the bottom one song is just poured down here it would be fine several of them are long slits designed to shoot arrows down through it the people in below and there there's a set of rafters and machinery as well that extend down to this level it looks like a pair of locks as well can be slid in down over the gates when they're opened or closed but the main thing in this room is that there are more of these barrels that have been stacked up barrels of various size and construction but here there are four more of these skeletal emaciated Knolls and there two of them are taking the lid off of one of these barrels and getting ready to dump it down one of the murder holes and I throw my javelin out that one okay go for it die like a 20 that's a hive to hit home for 10 damage nice you throw the javelin forward it lands in in its ribcage and shatters the bones apart and it collapses down in a heap with several of the bones falling through one of the murder holes and then I can I draw my hand axe yep and throw it at the one that was also helping it yep dies getting a sixteen to hit it collides with the four with its face and this one's for 11 damage splitting its head in half the rest of it collapses to the ground and the barrel that the two of them were just starting to pick up drops down sloshes about and wobbles and stabili but stops there's still two more of these creatures in the room seeing you come into the room they rush forward towards you and they're claw they barely have any weapons to them they just have these sharpened claws that they rake across you pollute oh hello I get a 22 and a natural one and a 11 and a 10-4 okay one hit so it comes in with this one claw just rakes it across the front of you and you take seven points of slashing damage ah I wound myself the wound to wound cry Sebastian you're up I come up behind Pluto so you come up you come up behind Pluto and look into this room you can see that there is another door directly opposite pollute oh this door however well it is originally of the same construction as the door your arcane trained eye notices this immediately for someone there are not scratches in the door opposite the bones that surround it are not fetishes that the Noles have put in place but rather deep slashes that are in this door you recognize them as the trappings of what might be an arcane lock [Music] so as I step around and I see the door I say guys don't open that other door yet until I check it out and I'm going to cast fire bolt on the one that just clawed at Pluto Jackson yep 12 that hits ya smashes face you like Ryan damaged it is blast apart anybody else are gonna take this opportunity to use a bonus action to turn sorcery points into another spell slot okay Dale you're up I come back out around oh my god sounds like there's some more noise over here and I see the one guy and I say duck and I take my shot and I go where down below me 20 the last shot rings true shattering the skeletal creature to pieces you yeah what will you do now uh Sebastian you said you shouldn't touch the store so go check it out we saw an initiative order or should I go check out the door time is of the essence for you can hear the thunder of the silver order drawing near I'm gonna use me they're gonna they're gonna be at the gate in less than five minutes I'm gonna grab that barrel that dropped mmm I'm gonna put the lid back on okay you said there was a lock for the gates correct there appears to be some bars that you could use in this chamber to prevent the gate from closing if you wanted to and all the gate machinery is above your heads but there's no winches like there's the gears that are pulling the gate up and operating them but there's nothing to get the mechanical leverage naturally in here that a human would operate but she can bar the date open like just stick something in there to there there's as they as the front gate rises up the there are places in it where you could slide so these metal bars that are on the ground to keep it open I'm gonna do that while you're look at the door so I'm looking at the door you're letting up yeah letting up and collecting my my hand Aksumite and I I am starting to examine the door and try to find a way to to disable miss magic if there is a way okay give me an hour kana check come on skull-splitter don't fail me now do or you failed me now that's a seven looking at this the um the arcane locks that are in place on this door have sealed it tightly closed if you can't even tell what the rules are behind this arcane lock you recall that arcane locks may have passwords or things to do that but what means this is actually sealed with and if there are any protections in place to harm those who try to tamper with it you cannot tell guys this door is locked magically that's about as far as I've gotten can I also give it a go just said like peek over your shoulder and be like hmm having not had any direct experience with these kind of arcane locks before you could still try opening it because because there is there is a keyhole on it but that would any means to try to get past the spell you don't even know if picking the lock is possible you could try it though can I show you throw something at the door I should want to touch it and then be like fried bananas you know I mean this could be any number of things happening on the store use one of the Knoll hands to try to open it I likey use one of its arms let's just start like poking it through the lock and try to like push the door open throw it at the door maybe it needs it you said it needs a password maybe the password is undead thing a dead null finger or we keep going down to try to get across or we somehow get back up sticks cuz we really or I'd have whoop seed that thing is there any like windows on either the front or back that I could fit through that you could physically fit through yeah no the windows here are arrow slits at the at their widest they're not even wide enough for your your head to fit through it's not because I have a big head it's because the windows they're too small change of plans what if Sebastian can you make me giant again I could just lift the portcullis from here I'll just grab the chains and pull it or you could does it look like that would work if we had a big enough creature pulling the chains if you just get a creature pulling the chains you can certainly try polymorph giant you think it might work it might you could also like it's gonna take a lot of my power I'm gonna look at the the chain see the way the portcullis is it's like it's like below us right yeah yeah and there's chains that are tying it up to the mechanism yeah there's chains that are tying it to a series of mechanical pulleys up and up in the top that then when those pulleys then when they winch inside pulls it raises the portcullis as if so you could pull you could try pulling the chains manually or lifting the portcullis manually but you would need a prodigious amount of strength to lift this massive gate and I try to lift it right now what happens if you try to lift the portcullis gate right I'm gonna try to get like a feel for how heavy okay what okay so I'm gonna just kind of like cake give me a strength check I can lift it ten okay Ludo you're prodigiously strong and you could probably under ideal conditions dead lift this thing up to maybe your knees and you'd need to release it after maybe 30 seconds so being able to open it so you could lift it but could you lift it long enough for an army to get through it probably not well you can polymorph giant 8 but we have these metal bars that we can stick in it that's what I was thinking job like we can stick stuff in it yeah guys also my my ring my mum's ring I got this from my mom right yeah it has an enlarged reduce maybe that's all it needs I'm a large you enlarge the Jade enlarge Pluto I lift it up and then so you guys start jamming the Spears in it to like hold the gate open and then we know if I ever have to go through the door yeah does that where strength tracks and strength saving throws you'll have advantage and will make you as strong as the eight but it will give you advantage and how well how strong is the ape like I don't think the Apes that much stronger than me like I'm kind of as strong as a giant ape the the only difference being the ape is a huge creature yeah and thus its carrying capacity is higher so it's maximum lift strength is higher than yours even though it's raw strength score is lower you're called Pluto you want to be enlarged or do you want to be extra online well I know that let's do the giant ape is definitely gonna work I thought maybe just to try to save you a spell slot but if it if this you know what let's just go all out Paul because at Palmer flats in an hour yeah and I mean Plan B smashed through the arcade over and just kill everything it would smash through the brick and wall if this doesn't work beside the door yeah around the door again you can try but the interior walls here are 5 feet thick pretty strong yeah you could punch your way through the door even if it blows up or something I mean what's the worst that could happen no don't stop before you start you get to sleep I don't you just ate okay shadowy tendrils come out of my hand and wrap around you and your turn transform pollute Oh Jackson into an ape alright grab that eight miniature behind us what are we using for the giant nice noise so so Pluto Jackson increases in size becoming this horrible shadow ape and the the creature fortunately because apes have to stoop cuz otherwise if he could stand up at his full height he would probably be hitting the rafters and the machinery above it would not be a pretty sight so here you are eight pollute oh if you're gonna pick this portcullis up and just try lifting it right up like right inside like the little holes okay well and then just start give me a strength check with advantage doing this I go to grab the beams as well to get them ready grab the other stages too right okay like as high as he gets it will be MIT twenty-one so you lift the gate about ten feet up and the two of you go rush forward with the bars and you slam them in J and the bars slam into place with a gate half open just as a pluto strength gives out for the moment okay take a breather we're gonna do one more of those what you're gonna grab lower and you're gonna pull out and then be ready to push back in yeah okay okay okay okay on the count of three and you're gonna go yeah does that make your hands more slippery eh Pluto no no no no okay thinking okay you ready I'm ready one two three hold 18 he lifts and you can't lift it too much too much higher enough and the gate starts to drop resound okay the two of you can give me quick dexterity checks just draw dexterity raw dexterity yep ten fourteen so Pluto you managed to slam one of the bars in and there you got a ten you slam both the bars in but the gate drops so it's it's still open about five feet but it's dropped down as this happens you can hear the thunder of the cavalry coming close and the door swings open uh-oh the arcane lock door yes the door swings open okay roll for initiative ah my mission now when I'm an ape I'm everything ape right so the knish ative his ape yeah I also don't benefit from things like my weapons and armor and some know they're subsumed in your hand your friend I am a weapon I'm gonna I'm gonna throw somebody down one of these murder holes and they're like we don't fit and I'll make you fit what's the donkey calling it don't throw them arrow you said okay what do we got 26:26 for van one bag on top 20 for sebastian 15 for sebastian sorry what did you get in 2020 okay and Pluto 15k I'm actually a little more dexterous likes the extra extra extra there it is we found it we got a lot as a giant ape that I am as a human man I'm also a little bit stronger and a little bit um warmer good I'm a little hungry too okay I want us to get that gate open that's the number one priority and I have an idea let's open five feet at least let's make it crawls okay I mean I'm hoarse as the doors open up several more of the skeletal Noel's stumbles yeah just up put one one or two in and Sebastian you turn around yeah there's four total in there but as you turn around you hear this voice say find out what's going on over there and Keadle them and you can Sebastian you can see into the room as the door opens up and there is this palpable glow of red and purple emanating throughout this entire room and you can see in the center of it is a large bubbling cauldron with a spigot attached to the side of it and there are there's a barrel under the spigot and one of the skeletal Knolls is finishing opening up like closing the spigot and pouring this liquid in the cauldron into the barrel looking over the cauldron are three Crone like figures one with purple skin that is covered in boils and pimples one that is covered in green skin that is slowing off and Matt and cracked and plays slot that is slowing off and the other with blue skin that looks like it might be frozen or suffering frostbite and the three Crohn's finished dropping a few ingredients into the the cauldron and the purple skinned one locks eyes with you and her hooked nose and flabby face stare stare at you with hate in her eyes and she says you'll make some good ingredients excuse EU do we have menus for those we do oh my gosh the purple the blue and the green gross and there around this the cauldron yeah I guess the purple one locked eyes with me yeah you okay all righty first off is veo um I'm kind of behind Sebastian and I see these dead Knowles and I just start taking shots at them so I'm gonna get my three shots okay ambush on my first turn seven seven the shot goes right through its ribcage no second shot 1313 that shot hits its spine I thought was which one the skeleton yeah cool dad take another one out he's 17 and another connect so you're able to quickly shoot down two of the approaching skeletal Knowles I shift out of the room just about ten feet back okay all righty seeing all of this Sebastian I back up and I'm going to I'm going to I think I think this works I'm gonna quicken a spell and then that still gives me my action yes that's correct and with my action can I throw a bead of fireball yes you can okay so no can I do the the action first and then the bonus I you look you look into the room Sebastian give me a perception check you 14:00 looking into the room you see all manner of arcane ingredients scrolls and books piled up amongst these Crone's collection of arcane objects would they survive a fireball perhaps perhaps not okay number two no that doesn't work with my quicken smell darn it there's so many valuable things in this room but I hate these witches Sebastian has one of those moments where he looks up and there's like those math equations and then he looks back and he locks eyes with that purple hag again and he says you know what I already have a book to study girls the last fireball into the room Oh No okay oh god no are you throwing it in the center I'm trying to land it right in their pots rape in their pot okay um well why don't you give me a let's see if you can throw the bead right in the pot give me a dexterity attack role do I am I proficient and throwing yes sure okay fifteen it lands in the pot and the fireball ignites it explodes sending the shrapnel of an acid of the pot flying all over the room so the fireball goes off in the cauldron shatters the iron of the cauldron and sends all this acidic bile spreading all over the room so instead of rolling the damage on the fireball I'm gonna have you roll 5d6 piercing damage and 5d6 acid damage because the fireball is basically contained inside the cauldron and instead it blows out a bomb yeah it basically sets a bomb off so the the fireball energy is absorbed destroying this cauldron and instead just send shrapnel and acid everywhere five yep we want this to be acid or shrapnel 12:17 so that's 23 shrapnel damage okay you know what I'm going to use can i yeah I can use both Mehta magic no cuz this is from the bead yeah and three I can't impact yeah okay fine asset damage so 23 on the shrapnel shrapnel 13 on the acid okay so 36 total so two of the witches are able to turn away and they throw themselves to the ground as the cauldron ignites the other just this piercing tranel just strikes all the way up and down her back and she screams out as it bursts into her her green flesh none of them are killed oh the Noles are completely destroyed though you and with my quickened spell mm-hmm I'm going to throw a web on to them okay as though as the last one falls to the ground she sees you starting to cast the spell and she counter spells it well so I go and nothing happens she throws down used like the the whole wreckage is clearing she's getting to her feet she sees you makes eye contact again says oh and as your magic comes back up the it's almost like the web's shoot forward and then they aged thousands of years and decay as she waves her hands and counter spells the magic looks cool and I yell Pluto smash and I jump out of the room and like push myself up against the wall okay I did my best you did good blowing those that up yeah okay that's the last of my necklace a fireplace so throm broza the the blue the one that just counter spelled you she turn turns forward and sees you rushing around the the corner over there and she she says oh you nasty little mongrel and she turns around and fires a lightning bolt that strikes through Pluto a Pluto and hits veo as well as it travels across the two rooms the two of you can make dexterity saving throws listen lady 13 a crackle of horrendous energy reaches down 21 the area so Pluto manages to dodge it but veo doesn't they oh the Lightning shoots up and down your tail sending all your hair on up and you take 27 electrical damage and Pluto you take half at Ford 13 you mmm-hmm the next one she um discouraged yeah this crash yeah this crash she is the blue one and she turns and walks forward and says oh I've always wanted a kitty cat and she sees veo and she casts polymorph on you hey make a wisdom saving throw I'm gonna come I'm gonna counterspell oh you're gonna counterspell you came around the corner well you don't have line of sight to her I guess I can't probably saving you got all 12 she turns you into a regular house cat I just don't shock my new pet pollute Oh Europe I turn okay lightning bolt flies to the room yeah it kind of singes me I see her yell vet at veo and you see veo turn into a regular black cat maybe it's a maybe it's a Bayer thing but this lady's standing in the doorway yeah I'm gonna bust her head in so I just I just give it one big punch like I wind up and I'm like kind of standing beside the door and I just kind of like throw my weight into it okay and I get a twenty eight to hit Smasher okay that's a hit yeah and yeah she's not gonna like this 23 damaged okay and then I'm gonna try to hit her again remarkably she makes her concentration take it as a oh oh oh it's on me and I'm punching her again I getting a 21-2 hit as she as the punch comes down she raises her hand and cash shield and blocks the attack and it your fist lands into it and she desperately looks oh because she's she's bloodied okay that's uh that's Pluto we go to the top with hemorrhage the purple and she sees pollute oh right up there in front of in front of everybody and she lowers her eyes down upon him and she holds her eye out as she weaves magic into it and her eye comes out on this long I stock and as it does so it kind of floats out above her like an antenna as she has cast the spell I bite oh and the energy flares with this power and Pluto you need to make a wisdom saving throw as an eight ten is not enough okay you are panicked you are frightened of her and on each of your turns you have to take the dash action to move away from her by the safest and shortest available route no I was gonna be pounding on the wall and if I don't see her anymore dry something happen or um you are I'm just super payin ya right now you are frightened and if you if you move to a space at least sixty feet away from where you can no longer see her you are no longer frightened the audience yeah okay the Noles have been destroyed we go to the top of the round with veo who is a common house cat for the the upper area and the gears is there any like landings well there there are what would you like to do where are you going with this and honestly just thinking about getting out of the way so these guys can stop the concentration actually you know what how can I ask a question how many have points do you have what happens if you die they turn back away oh actually you know what I just like scratch my face you're gonna scratch yourself okay so you just put a thing so you try to like charge in headbutt a wall okay some acid here's only how do you do I'm going to have you roll in intelligence check as a cat to see if you have the presence of mind to do that because while you do have your personality as that as the effect of the polymorph spell your mental capacity is greatly diminished yeah yeah - okay so you do scratch and claw at yourself but as you start to do so you realize that you're really itchy behind the ear and you starts just scratching behind naturally yeah yeah yeah Sebastian what are you gonna do okay can I pick up the cat just as like a free auction can you pick up cat Bay oh yeah she's busy licking her butt so yes and I'm gonna try to get like push past blue and get to the other side carrying cat now okay and then I'm going to throw cat veil that's my action though if I throw cafe oh right yes where are you going with this I I don't know yet I was okay cuz because before you get into the room I'm gonna have you make a check to muscle past okay you know what you know what yeah we're just doing this I'm gonna run and I'm just gonna throw cat veil at blue and I just throw it on like go veil and then I am going to again hide okay right over and hide make an attack roll okay what's the next arity yeah with you used your am i proficient with throwing cats no I mean you're kind of good at herding cats so go for it ten so you throw cat veio forward and she lands on the ground waiting at the feet of of dysgraphia the blue and you see me poking my head up just from behind a barrel going okay throm bros yeah she that's hilarious that's so funny she sees the cat and she tackles to herself as well and turns around the corner and sees Pluto Jackson hello as the ape and she's gonna fire a ray of sickness at you oh she's gonna up cast it using a higher level spells lot though oh my god she gets she gets an eight to hit alright okay and dysgraphia will go next she is very close to that eight but you are frightened as well so she is also going to fire a ray of sickness at at you hello getting a 15-2 hits that's a hit you take 20 points of poison damage counter spell it I can't see her she's yeah and make a constitution saving throw eight waited you you there it is sorry how much damage again 20 points of poison damage you thank you and then Khan save dude did you do eight okay you're poisoned as well and so you disadvantage on attack roles and ability checks although you also have that because you're frightened I'm frightened in poison yeah it's your it's your turn and I run the other way so you can't fit through this door so I'm just gonna start pounding on the wall screaming and throwing up like giant eight throw up it's bad yeah because everything I eat is like yeah it's like if they're having I ate last week yep and it seeps down the murder holes okay you hear voices cry out the other gate hasn't risen yet what should we do and you hear another voice say I hope there what's going on in there we are not running into a trap are we and you hear the horn calls out as this as the silver orders charge stops and there as they measure whether or not they can get into the gates itself they're on this side though they're on that side yeah that gates off yep top of the round they oh you're a crazy cat in front of them I'm just like I'm freaked out as a cat um so I see this like crazy woman in front of me and I just like take a swing okay go for it yeah I hope this kills her please kill her so you leap into her face you get the eye the one that she pulled a nine on concentration the eye that she pulled it you grab it and you run away one that polymorph her oh yeah you leave scratch in your face and now there's a full size of a out just right yeah - no I like back up through the door around the corner think at the realizes what's happened and you leap around a bigger version of what I once was okay Sebastian your honor is in this I mean I want to push I want it I do want to like try to push pastor all right we're gonna make we're gonna make an opposed dexterity check then I use I guess that's the same yeah acrobatics if it applies hell it doesn't Oh God I got I got a three you run up to her and credit postmasters just know okay and then as she says no I'm just going to [Music] Thunder step I was gonna push past her in thunder step but but that that will hit a I really wanted to push past her man you probably should have relative three well thanks do you want a thunder stepper do you wanna do something else okay you know what I go to push past her she pushes me back and I'm gonna hypnotic pattern you no I'm already concentrating on this yeah and I need it I need you I need you I'm good I mean from where you're standing you could reach eight gluto if you want to understand okay so she pushes me back and I go okay and they grab eight Pluto's leg and I just thunder step my tail you got my tail yeah you do my Apes up tails no and I Thunder step okay so dysgraphia has to make a check constant Constitution sixteen okay she she crits it so she only takes half damage huh can't kill them and put her back in the doorway um I like I love it I like it I love it I think it said details I think yeah it is those are not the right days thank you very much you're welcome I have that back you you thirteen damage Jacob okay alrighty under step I run I don't know what I hide in the corner okay yeah those doors are actually open because the Noles that were in this room where the the withered Knowles from before in that case I run actually I I moved so I can only really run really okay the doorway he's in the doorway okay so throm brochure I'm seeing you running into the room looks at you Sebastian says oh you are knowing little red runt I've got a much prettier look for you and she cast polymorph on you and I cast counters phone okay um you will need to make a caster level check to stop her counter spell okay so what Arkana yeah yep you will need to be 14 okay nailed it okay nice you defeat her counter spell oh yeah no more points no and dysgraphia turns and says you're going to let him control your feeble magic sister and she says i'll turn him into a newt and she also casts polymorph on you make me wisdom saving throughout you can you can be that you can meet it so why it's so wise so strong so strong so wagon again an 11 all right he turns you into a newt concentration you can still concentrate on your spell while you're in new what color changed him that would have been that's disgrace the the hag that are no dysgraphia is the hag that had polymorph oh yep and what was the one that I might mean uh that is uh that's hemorrhage who is the last one they act on the round a dreamboat oh yeah yep so with that we go to Pluto who is frightened still how a you're on the other side I have to I'm gonna try to run away again which one are you running away from the green yeah there is nowhere for you to move okay um that is a that is in this room have you ever heard an ape screen so you so you can thrash out an attack but you will do so with this advantage I thrash out and attack wildly it's wild attack it's probably gonna be a um a 12 no enjoy swing twice yep yep so you thrash out wildly pounding against the walls and the ground with your sickness and everything but throwing up right now with with where Sebastian left you you're surrounded on all sides by all three of them so you're effectively like surrounded by the sources of your fear so you got nowhere to go yes my plan my next attack was a nineteen that is a hit what do I hit um I'm gonna roll a d6 to see which one you hit one two three four five six so you hit hemorrhage the purple one good one that has I bite yep [Music] twenty-one damage bludgeoning damage that leaves her bloodied um and does she make her concentration checked please she does oh she does she so I bite continues to be in effect as you swipe her with the backhand and she stumbles back and growls it is her turn and she does not like being right up to you and she's like you'll be hey that she turns the eye down upon you and she says uh and she uses the I bite against you again and this time she's gonna try to make you go to sleep Oh make it wisdom saving throw uh-oh 18 okay you succeed oh my gosh yeah why so wise I'm a wise ape all right no no sign language you are indeed we go to the top of the round with Vail all right a peak out around the corner and I see the blue hag that turned me into a cat and I say nobody makes me a smaller version of myself and you shoot the doorway beside her and then as a bonus action I cast ever strike and I say let me try this one more time nobody makes me a smaller version of myself and then I got a 22 hit that is a hit oh you close enough no no she's I think she's a little she is no there yeah because I'm huge that's when he ate damage what happens she is slain oh I wanna get her right in the throat so she can't cast anything else and dies and with a gurgling noise she falls to the ground and you feel in this moment the magic of the other Crone's is broken as without their sisterly bond they have lost their Matt the anchor of their magic and the I bite spell ends my newts fellas yeah my newt you're not mine anymore you got better corner she turned me into a newt that's so rude Newt I got better we go now to Sebastien who has gotten better for being new I step out and I'm like which one of you hags turned me into and then I see the dead one oh well I'll take my vengeance on the rest of you and I'm just gonna cast a fire bolt at the green ones face yeah that's gonna be a 19 that is a hit 13 damage okay she's not dead and then I run back into this room okay the with uh so dysgraphia is dead so I throm brochure the green hag she disengages and she pushes herself against the arcane locked door which swings open on the other side so the second door of this room was also arcane long leading out onto the battlements and she opens it up runs through it and slams it closed Oh abandoning your sister paladins out there you neither of you can see because you're both hiding behind the walls I don't even know okay and next we go to pollute oh I I've regained my mind I'm not as frightened I run back oh wait I can't fit through those doors no no you can't you cannot fit through those doors I'm gonna make the rajah this Gracia fit through the door hemorrhage yeah I'm just gonna start pounding on her head in rage and I miss I I hit what I think is a I attack what I think is her and I missed with one big fist and then I come down with an 18 it smashes her in the face and Oh gross 35 damage oh my god that's way too these are bloodied and horribly broken but still alive if only barely man I really wish I didn't miss on that first attack yeah that's me I it's her turn she's also gonna disengage and run through the arcane lock door no we need to get this gate open yeah I there's a problem yeah I brought Pluto into this world by this world I mean this room and and I don't know how to get him out well your are us know already in the South Tower it's true let's just go up yeah I get through the doorway to lead into the mill that's you that door is even smaller question though we need to undo the locks that the pins in that door yes go up unless somebody gets it and we way down here tell you what okay I'm gonna run over to like these or the the silver order are they at the gate they're there the calorie is almost here yep okay I stopped concentrating on a Pluto and I'm like guys we need to we need to get that gate up we need to go upstairs and figure that out right now yep go and we need to unlatch the gate as well yep so I guess we're gonna let the gate drop the five feet okay do it yeah so you unlatch it it drops and then we need to run upstairs cool you rush up the ladder and before you is another another room like before which looks like the the these Crone's might have been using it as their bedchamber of some kind it's very disgusting and filthy and shows piles of half-eaten corpses rats in cages and various amounts of fecal matter but you're able to clear a path through and get to the other machinery you pull open the gate yeah I let the rats go there is a horn that sounds as a thunderous charge of the silver order rushes forth towards the gate and that's where we're gonna take our break before we delve into the ruins again a big THANK YOU to accent shield for providing us with the awesome gaming accessories that you see in

order with them with that let's return to the ruins there is a thunder of hooves a roaring tide as the Calvary of the silver order charges forward across the field towards temple gate you can hear the clash as as the gate Rises on both sides a group of Knolls from near the city from the inside of the city rush through the gate to meet the oncoming cavalry but they are smashed aside and you can hear the sounds of battle in the underneath the murder holes below you and looking up for our moment Sebastian you catch eyes of virgil fighting forward on horseback as the silver order charges through the gate and that you can hear the sounds of battle all around you as the silver order pushes the attack what will you do are we supposed to do at this point blow the horn horn toot - right - dude do you have the horn do I so you're blowing it inside the walls so that's a little a little hard for them to hear but a few up above they get the signal that you're OK yeah I'm like blow the horn go up and you're already blowing it and it's like if you do so the this room is ruined and in utter chaos after sending the explosion of the cauldron rocking across the entire room there are tatters of corroded books Scrolls vials of various all chemical ingredients dying insects and several secure chests pardon me there are several secure chests that Hebb have survived some of the shrapnel as well but you can see stacked up in the corner mix these glowing graziers are the the shadow remnants of what looks like several heads on spikes that were in this room flanking a the marred and acid-washed ruins of a small idol carved in a familiar form that of a goat-headed demonic figure with bat-like wings that is scattered now on the floor opposite the remnants of the cauldron and the large desk that the hags had in this room sky again was the statue doing here the statues blown up - it's covered in trap kn'l and damaged from what's happened there's a big piece of iron that's kind of clocked off part of the face of it and it's been knocked over from the from the battle but now that you can see that it is is here as the battle rages around you I kind of pick it back up and like stand it up and just kind of step back it's a small Idol made of obsidian stone so it's quite heavy but it's no larger than about 12 inches in height itself and it's just kind of the the demonic form kind of sitting cross-legged as I stand it back up I kind of step back and I go are you there demon sorry for destroying you I didn't know you were here I don't know if you can hear me are you apologizing to him yeah you're apologizing the demon well I blew up his face just I feel bad about that do you want to do that though now what I want out of this demon yet we're still working on our get order myself yeah as you talk into it it seems that the damage to the face of the statue if it had any ability to communicate whatever's happened to it it seems to be broken like you feel you can see that the obsidian is cracked all the way through from the explosion itself oops huh I'm more we're in it is just silent stone nevermind then and I I'd like to look around the rest of the room did I blow up like is everything go it is in really bad shape there are the charred remnants of several arcane spell scrolls and the broken vials of several potions and marred ruins of of spell books on the shelves around here there are several chests and cracks cracked vials and other broken arcane implements and pieces of ingredients there are several chests that have survived the devastation but I'll pretty much as you go through it you might want to spend longer time to go through for sure but at first glance most of the arcane implements did not survive what happened in this room I want to start to pick open the chests [Music] door that door and the other door if we look through can I see to the other side is that door still closed that other door is still closed yet because we might want to either help out the fight on the wall or I kind of want to try to see if I can pick up the dead hag and use her to open the door this time I gonna use her body and like push your hand against the thing against the door it does not open rats good track sure and I throw her slim body against the door in anger I'm still picking the lock do I get anything out of the the chests yeah you're able to give me a theory check as you open up the chest okay so you crack open the chest very very quickly getting several of them broken up and open as you open the chest up inside are several trinkets and bags of gold a few secured manuscripts and there are three large Delirium crystals probably each weighing about 25 pounds Oh now remember that a delirium crystal because delirium is a is about as dense as gold it doesn't need to be very big for it to weigh 25 pounds but these are very valuable delirium crystals they're probably the other type that you could probably sell to the Academy for at least a thousand gold pieces each holding a little men and there are six smaller fragments that are probably worth about a hundred gold pieces each six Raglan's yeah six large chips right now we're dealing in that that's in in one one of the chests that is is in there inside the chest was approximately 742 gold pieces like basically do 47:33 take 240 nice and then once we saw all that delirium we can buy me a new ring well we'll see about who we're selling it to though no we're going to investigate the opening up the chest you can see that the inside of this chest that had the Delirium in it the inside of it was lined with lead Oh okay well that's always good to know yeah maybe that helps shield from magic our delirium yeah there's like some we don't know hmm you wear lead armor can you carry delirium there is another one other chest that you're able to open up as well with how well you open up the first one you figure out that the mechanism is the same in both the other chest contains another 387 gold pieces in various coins as well as several a box of turquoise animal figurines in carbon various shapes it's probably worth about 250 gold pieces as well take 120 yeah and there were several scrolls and potions in this room but they have been destroyed who did that 250 gold pieces do we have to sell them or can we just add the gold no you can you should write them down but because you will have to sell them to somebody yeah three three what one material they are made of turquoise circles finally as you survey the wreckage pollute oh you see that there is a sac that is curiously intact Oh a curious and it seems to have some volume to it like there's something inside it it's it's a large sack probably about a foot in size like something that would be large to wear on your waist but you could and it looks like there's something soft inside it I reach inside no as you reach inside you can feel what feels like to be a curled up fuzzy ball inside I look there's a you you look inside kittens and it looks like there are several curled up fuzzy balls that have various types of animal fur around them Oh Oh what are those are they breathing are they alive there's slightly breathing like pulsing like they're breathing oh and they're balls they're not like in a pick one up gently roll it d8 Oh No gently five as you pick the ball up as if you pull it out of the bag it drops out of your hand and falls at your feet and uncurls and a gigantic black bear put it back in the bag and it seems totally friendly to you it's like a big fuzzy bear and it's it yeah yeah the fuzzy ball enlarged into a full size black bear my face on its eye same color as me this is some kind of trickery you know that's that bag is magic and I think you just pulled a bear out of the bag this is this bag is or is it just a regular there's some magic to it whatever the whatever these strange balls inside it are it became a creature yeah can you put it back in the bag can try I don't think it wants to go back just try this is my friend now his name is my first idea wasn't gonna be good did a girl or guy uh it's uh it's a boy and his name is Huk ah I start trying to put Huck back into the bag uh you you try as you might and you cannot force the bear back into the bag come on I do examine Athol you realize that this item is a tan bag of tricks it's a magical item and three times per day you can pull such orbs out of it and they become animals um you got it that's a neat little bag of tricks you got there Pluto holding your tricks oh no this is hilarious and you continue to loot the room the sound of battle continues all around you maybe we did a lot of work I mean we did most of the work I say is there like charging against an army yeah do you guys want to like open up this door to the wall and just see what's going on oh yeah we can't it's arcane locked right we go the other way though there is a short time later as you as you go up and one of the the you hear a call from the stairs that you were you destroyed the ladder you say hello up there are you alright who's that who goes there ah now I thought I heard you all up there you blew that horn it's it's Virgil you remember Virgil yes you're all all right up there we're making it bye did you bring the healing with you we've got flame keeper Hannah with us do you need help yes well I mean we took care of everything up here but I would like flame keeper Hannah - well you you come on down you got a way to get down you it was a youth doc down this ladder well we did to make sure that nobody would come up there were a lot of Knowles we tried to break passageways as we went good that you did there were a bunch down here oh we're so smart we managed to fight our way through the doors on the on the inside of the city I think the gates ours now yes we did our job we made sure for ourselves okay yeah I'm gonna come down and I am I take my shot and I pointed towards the girl and I get it to Wiz me down the ladder but what about the rest of us I jump down higher rope I guess cuz fail isn't being helpful to the rest of us and I climb I climb down Virgil says I know you've done a lot veo but if you can run a line back up to the top we're gonna try to seize the battlements here there's uh we were getting word back from the hooded lanterns that we're probably gonna see another wave of Noel's coming to try to retake the gate right away and if we want to hold this for any more than a day we need to fortify it before the next wave comes so you want me to do have a rope I do perfect and I use my grapple to have myself up each way and like attach a rope as I go all the way up to the top but making sure that I clip it in along the way you're through this place is a horrible mess yep a lot of Knolls required a lot of mass flame keeper Hannah's here she's gonna tend to you we were we're gonna turn this level here quickly and do a bit of a hospice for the wounded we've got we've lost a lot but we're gonna get everybody alive we're gonna keep who we can alive alright if you seriously hurt yes I'm actually I'm okay I got stuck by a Manticore I got a lot of spells thrown at me I got electrified they turned me into a newt me a cat I mean I'm already a newt well I got better how many times can we make that joke in one episode go for the record in any case virgil continues all right well you've done you must be exhausted you based on how many Knowles were down here and how many were up there you were really this was like the strong point like we've run into resistance there's some big big anger mothers back there but this was a lot you've worked a miracle here that's what we do we are my name is sebastian crowe taker of temple gate the Noles paid the ultimate toll the nola toll then oil toll well the day is not over yet we're gonna bring the next wave in through we're gonna have to fight them off but now that we got this we gotta send the signals to the hooded lanterns get them here because they got better archers than us and they're gonna be better defend in this place that we are I can use some of my magic to help secure ladders back onto these areas so that we have ways up and down is the other stairwell intact the other one should be all right then we should be able to fortify the south the siege towers landed on the battlements on the walls to the south as well so we're doing well up there but we might expect another way from the north to you all you deserve a bit of a rest though I think so I could use a rest well you we have a day before another day of them like more Knowles show up right you kiddin me the hooded lanterns have done well we haven't heard too much from them though about how they're pushing the nola forces but we're expecting the nose to regroup an attack back here within another hour at least oh okay see what we can get I'm not gonna be much use to you that's fine you've done your part it's will you take your help if you can get it but we're gonna be now that we've taken the gate our front lines we're gonna send them back to rest and recuperate we're gonna send in our reserves to hold the gate now if you want to help out that could help the situation but if you can't no one's expecting you to I can help hold the gate I can help the archers but honestly we we could do as a party with the rest though I got a few little spells that I can conjure up maybe I'm pretty drained it's okay maybe just the through the murder holes I could I could fire boat from some murder holes hopefully I don't come to that does all the mechanism still work in here yeah our intent is to close the gate from this side use the siege Tower on the side and load people up and get people onto the walls and fight from the inside we hold the walls now so that means that we can attack the Noles that are coming from inside the city and from even the rest of here we're gonna be using this as a strong point and hopefully just turn this into a killing field but strategy and then when do you plan on moving forward to the Cathedral once we've ran down the numbers of the Noles we expect probably the that big old Knoll that lower the feast probably gonna gear up for a counter-attack of his own if he was babies as vicious as they say who knows how soon that could come it could come today I can't take on the Lord of the feast until I get a nappy nap yeah I think we're gonna need a long rest in order to regain our strength and then come full force into the battle with the Lord of the feast or at least to push past them and get to the cathedral I think we thought literally as hard as we could to get this gate we want to take on the Lord of the feast but if what you're saying is true and they could have a counter-attack I think it's important that we go now we tend to our wounds we rest up and we make sure that we're ready to go by as soon as possible give us our hours in that case I'll get you to my routers and they'll ride you back to camp dawn will they be able to write us back here as soon as we're done arrest Gretchen's amazing are you guys okay with that I'm not gonna be very helpful out here I mean like I could go by myself yeah you're all in good shape there's a lot of there's a lot of us that are hurt a lot worse than you three like even at your lowest capacity I think you could still do a lot for the gate because if we lose the gate all this is in vain and if we're not here to defend what if the Lord of the feast shows up like then he's probably going to take it with take it from them I think if how about we do a short rest help fortify and then take a long rest so you said ten hours right so to take a nap an hour to help fortify after a short rest and we can take eight hours along because at least if they counter-attack work here we can't even sleep being even long rest you yeah if we help fortify it and then take a long rest while we're here at least they can wake us up there the biggest advantage we have right now is that if the Lord of a feast or any of the other Knowles tack we're counting on them not having anything in the way of siege equipment they don't have the means to scale a wall they don't have ladders they don't have grapples they don't have anything like we've got and on the other side of the city they've got to contend with all the ruins and everything else in there which is a killing ground for the hooded lanterns to know the streets like the back of their hands it's much harder for them to attack us than it was for them now that we've taken this gate I think that they can hold this position it if you say so I mean I don't want to tell you what to do I'm just I'm just saying that right now I can't turn anybody into anything I can't teleport I can't I like I I feel very tired Pluto maybe yeah maybe there's a I have a shot on my arm is it may be a little potion you could even even that potion that's gonna give me one big attack yeah I think we did better too to rest up because I mean for me my magic too I'm pretty low as well and and I saw you fighting in there and I also saw you slowing down a bit until I turned you into an eight so I don't don't try to act like you're the most heroic person in the world I don't I know that you think you are right I mean you are the most heroic person I've ever met but I don't want to see you die out there yeah I feel like if we're not here the gates gonna get lost then let's sleep here yeah if we can long rest can we long rest here you can stay here if you want to I mean we are gonna try and use the space to shelter any of the wounded and we're gonna use every inch of it for defenders but if you want to stay here you want to rest here we're not gonna stop you we would love to have you helping out here and if you feel better about camping out here doing that I just don't know if you're gonna get much of a rest because this Fighting's not gonna let up I say we go back to camp and then we can always keep an eye out I would leave you guys if it gets rough like send word for us and we'll come back is there an option for one of us to stay behind and take a short rest while the other two go and take a long rest or does that I don't I'm I'll come with you guys where it seems like Jack and forest I actually don't know how that mechanically works like I want to play to our strengths right now and I agree with you I just do not want to go up against the Lord of the feast as I currently am I'm out of all ability to do things I'm out of sorcery points and spell slots no I agree with you it's just that if he's coming and we're not here this might all be for nothing and so I'd rather be here even if we can't take him then not be here does that make sense like we're the only thing standing if he cut all you need is a short rest to get back up and running right I mean you just need to like take a small nap thank you take a nap how far away are we if we go to camp like how much of a ride in would it be couple miles so like we get here and we could take you back up as well to to the barracks but of course the other side of the city the whole sprawl it's a battleground right now too we don't know all the Noles that are outside the city walls have all been stirred up like a bunch of Hornets as well and we're expecting we're expecting that we're gonna have to consolidate here at temple gate because all the Noles that are outside the city and all the Noles that are inside the city they're gonna converge right back on here and we're gonna have to do and do this all over again I mean a couple miles is a couple miles right what if I can I load can trips into my smell storing ring they aren't leveled spells so what would the purpose would that be to give it to Pluto to attune to temporarily with a fire bolt that he could use as a flare they have means of signaling okay that would be more efficient than that fair yeah I just wanted to check so what if what if you stayed here me and Vail went back to camp and rotated sleeping shifts so that we were just watching and as soon as you send a signal to us we'll come back if you go to camp and we need you by the time you get back here it might be too late if you guys want to sleep it's okay if you want to go back to camp but we're gonna do and we're gonna do our best but you either need to be here or not because even if we signal you even if to get you somewhere safe where you can rest is either here or back at one of our camps and if there's trouble someone shows up like look it we took the it's only been a short battle we you did a blitz job on this place and if we gotta hopefully no one can mount an attack like you did back on us because I don't think we could handle it counter attack like that I don't think there's anybody else who could act like us unless it's us there were those hags but but no eggs are broken we killed one of them friends were we're tracking for us we're team so I we're not splitting up I don't I'm with I don't want to abandon this post but I'm scared of like we can't continue the way we were like I'm exhausted yeah we gotta rest that took everything if you guys want a um with you let's go back to camp we've you all have given us everything and you don't need to feel bad now it's our turn to do our part yeah we're not this is what we're here for we know that that without you we wouldn't have gotten this far well there's a whole bunch of people here whole bunch of my soldiers that would be dead if you had an arrest your labs doing this but you did we lost far fewer people than we would have been a full frontal assault without that things went well on the walls but what you all did here the way you blew up all those siege engines right off of the top those things would have killed dozens of people before we could have gotten you could have got close but that alone but then the fact that you open the gates and let us come through we are control here let us in the hood of lanterns do our part okay where are three people army but there are many people army also you guys can keep Huk Huk yeah if any of you guys want to ride a bear how did you get a bear in here you know what magic yeah it's probably it's the bag let's just say that Pluto Jackson has a bag of tricks in his pocket in his bag and his back fair enough it's a bag in a bag alright I'll get some of the riders they're gonna ride you back do you want to head back to the barracks or two camped on the campus closer great the barracks is closer but the routes more dangerous I got a direct line back to camp Dom I say back to camp camp yeah my commander you hold this position I'm not the knight commander I am Virgil and he is exhausted okay he's really tired so tired I thought that all of the paladin's were the knight commander and look at the cut he has on his he know I'm a lieutenant if you will lieutenant Virgil did I do at that time technically not lieutenant but in any case he leads you out he leads you down there's a there's a there's a Sally gate or a app or a port gate that leads into the towers from inside the city so they lead you down to the lower level where there's just carnage of slain Knowles and they've they're already bringing in some of the wounded paladin's to tend to them and flame keeper Hannah does come up to all of you and she does cast prayer healing so you all regain 20 hit points just it just to get you out there I see young fiery haired flame keeper that was on the frontlines of the cavalry she says go with the light she cast the prayer of healing and and also tends to several the other wounded that have been brought in as well there are a few of the paladin's that have been had limbs hacked off that have Grievous wounds across their faces and bodies they're screaming in pain but all of them you can see even the most wounded of them there's the purpose that's lighting their eyes that they know that they have achieved something today as I walk by one of the ones with the missing limb I looked down at the cut on my hand and I look at the the Paladin I say I know buddy and I keep on and he says don't worry just a scratch I know I got one two brothers in arms as you okay there's a short as you head out the doorway leading into this tower has been battered down by the paladins there's a small ram in a staircase that leads down and you're inside the city in temple road a temple road as paladin's slaughter the last remaining Knowles in the square that's just around temple gate and as they do so you can see that that there's a horn call as several more of the hooded lanterns come out from the ruins and start approaching from various sides and you see a rather bloodied Ansem come come out he's got blood strewn all across his face and he comes up to Virgil and he acknowledges all of you and says it's been hard fighting on the inside but we've held them back they're gonna regroup little though they'll probably be more of them within the hour we've got a lot of wounded but you've taken the gate you did it we did we lost a lot of people but we managed to stop the Knowles inside the city from coming towards the gate Petra she's she's okay she's hurt but she's okay the Lord Commander himself is regrouping the rest of the hooded lanterns and we're gonna be making for this disposition to recuperate a few of us are gonna be retreating back to the barracks as well we think that there's probably gonna be more coming within the next hour - for another attack but some of it but our advance scouts have gone out around the Cathedral and we're trying to see if the Lord of the feast is going to join the field we haven't caught sight of him yet that's good you look like you need some healing it's been a lot there were a few close calls and we lost a few good people I got stabbed by a Manticore it was terrible there were a few more of them out here around here as well yeah I got cut you look fine to me I just came from a pair of prayer of healing well aren't you lucky healing we could use it and I put my hand on him and I cast second level cure wounds no that's so kind and I'm humble well next time you can take the Cape in nine healed me thank you there's a few moments I appreciate it your cuts gone do you have any more where that came from I got a few more people that really need it badly I got one more on me but as he says so flame keeper Hannah says I can get them it's it's alright this is what I'm here for she had this looks at Virgil and says are you getting them out of here and Virgil nods alright get back as well we're gonna send a few more of our units here to help reinforce we did it we took the gate still have a lot of fighting to do we're gonna be back here as soon as we're able so will we is it dangerous along the way back inside the city we've got our reinforcements and our reserves we mean our reserves have been protecting the route back to the barracks inside the city if you want to we could lead you through the city back to the barracks as well well this go the safe route all right you're going to camp Don yeah okay see on the other side with that Virgil sets you on a few horses with several the other wounded Knights and you ride with a group of basically those there are a few members of the silver order that were part of the initial assault that have survived that are not wounded and they are riding with you back and amongst all of you even the horses that you're riding on are handing with exhaustion several of the Knights and the riders they kind of consolidate and there's a few like there's a few people that are riding horses that they didn't come in on and vice versa because some have been slain but some of the horses were saying but the riders were not and vice versa so people have mixed it up a little bit and so you and about a dozen other members of the silver order solemnly ride back out of the city towards kept on the din of battle begins to die down as you ride out of the city and it gets quiet again as you go through the Karen Hills towards we're camped on is what time of day is it it's now the afternoon the attack was in the morning it wasn't this morning and is it now actually yes as you write out a torrential rain breaks and there's a crack of lightning an afternoon thunderstorm comes in bad memories say you got hit by lightning feeling the static in the errands not pleasant seems fitting I just wanna warn or those things rhyme it's a fresh fresh cleansing you bring it back and I'm ready bright new attitude toward to our brighter there's a man like dying no no hearts wait warm right - yeah as the clouds break open and rain pours down and lightning strikes through the sky one of the other night says this is good this is good fate smiles upon us but the rain coming down like this the Knowles won't be able to counter-attack the walls themselves will be too slick mm-hmm they'll be able to get close but it'll be hard for them to climb up the mud around the city walls will bog them down it'll be much easier for us to defend in the rain and we get to stay dry and they get soaked I'm pretty sure we're getting wet right now yeah I mean we not bone-dry our our whole team back there how they get to stay dry but Knowles we'll get soaked sure we can just shoot them from the Myrtle's personally I fight better when I'm not soaking wet yeah I don't like to be doing what good guys that was that was intense no super intense and now you turned it to a cat you turned into a different type of cats a smaller version of what I kind of already am but yes no that was very unpleasant never polymorph me into a cat ever I won't why do you have reason benefit us usually I mean usually sorry for throwing you I thought that you would hit the hag but instead I threw you at its feet but the nice squatter yeah I saw that that was great and Pluto you pushed a guy off a tower and then you tripped a Manticore out of the sky and then you stabbed it twice and didn't kill it I hit a guy with a javelin yeah I saw that did you arrive back at camp dawn there are a few of the the silver order Squires that are Manning the fort and holding it down and you were greeted once again by a philia Reed who is commanding the camp she says as you come in welcome back how did it go we've taken temple gate we we dug down now triple threat that is great news you need rest yeah yeah it's nailed it calm long day I'll see you to somewhere where you can down four than that it'll be be able to get some sleep do you need anything to soothe you knelt to a song I think we can do that they lead you to one of the barracks tents that they've set up where there's some softer beds and they set and she says a bunch of the other captains are out on the field right now so you can take these thank you I push it into like a into like where all the heads of the bed are all like pointing at each other so we make like kind of like a fork like a triangle I don't know what the word is I know you know exactly what I mean though everyone knows what I mean you rearranged the room so that we can sleep head to head yeah and we're anything else you would all like to do before you sit down for the night Pluto as of our bet I was keeping dry oh you killed so many more but you know what without your help especially turning into that giant ape we wouldn't it got out of there alive so I will give you a cat massage turnover and I eagerly await you killed almost as many nulls or people as me so I'm gonna give you a cat massage after and you know what fails can we get can we get some some fish and in here for BAM do what we can I'm gonna reach into the bag no okay do it and I pull out a giant weasel and what's an axe beak an axe beak is a large ostrich like bird kind of like a strange mix be ridden that's how large they are yeah say what you're just pulling out these animals not in the tent they have a nasty disposition and they tend to attack unfamiliar creatures but they can be trained as mounts and are in some parts the world Jack's we can wait outside but the giant weasel is also helping with the back it's a big feathered ostrich like bird it's yellow in color and it kind of like oh my god this is the ultimate question I am going to bed make me take that bag of tricks away from you if you keep pulling out giant animals indoors that might accidentally like kill somebody who doesn't recognize I'm going to take their bag away their corpses vanish when reduced to zero head points so it's a lot we learn that we could have a giant ax being swing this is horrible we learn about it that it dies from that because Baio tries to fail maybe it's one of the situations that like you can eat it but once it actually dies whatever you ate disappears as well so you're left empty oh we're so hungry after yeah I don't they're alive living creatures but they're not oh we're a good team we tried you know tested it out it could have been an unlimited source of food but it's the weasel under my bed yeah the weasel is just going around he's exploring all right finished my cat massage I'm going to bed my faceplant into the pillow and start snoring the night passes I sleep to morning comes and there is a stream of soldiers in the morning returning to camp Don many wounded as over the night several wagons bearing the dead and the wounded of the Silver order are brought back into camp Don there are no one disturbs you in the morning and as you take your breakfast a few of the other soldiers say even though some of them are wounded come up to and say I heard about what you three did one of the soldiers says and I was running towards the walls and I saw that fireball go off that took the ceiling and I thought that hadn't happened I would have been dead thank you no problem my name's Sebastian Crowe and I'm here to rescue you when you need me and as the afternoon [Music] another one of the Paladins comes up to you and says rides into the camp and find you it says are you all doing fine I feel much better fine now how does the wall hold we held out through the night yeah we had to change out we lost a lot of people they kept attacking us all night no one there got a lick asleep but we made it for the night the hooded lanterns lost a lot of people but their arrows and archers they held it through the night we should go check in with the commander's yeah captain and the Lord Commander have returned to the hooded Lantern's barracks where they're planning the next steps should've asked when you can to return I think we're ready now yeah Fudo you ready let's ride let's do it cool where's my giant weasel just as you begin begin gathering your things together there's a little bit of a commotion at the gate of camp dawn and you can hear an argument behind between one of the guards and they turn back around to you and say there's someone else here at the gate asking for the three of you what do they look like it's this this blue-haired tiefling woman's here asking for you hmm I have mixed feelings yeah we should probably go talk to her yeah she better make it walk I snappy I'll talk to her we'll meet her outside we want out yeah there in the in her usual garb while traveling cloak and leathers the symbol of the amethyst Academy concealed is River she smiles she says you three have been very busy can we talk we talk river what class were we in together in school well we had an itinerary where we were in basic potions and canned trips I remember when you cast your first fire bolt and you also knocked over all the shelves and potions class with your first major hand what's my favorite you like all fish but you particularly enjoy salmon how many fingers are like to say trick question I like Alton yes okay thank you we've we've had past all of our tests we've had some very interesting things occur in the time that you've been gone there's some things for the record yeah doppelgangers can read your mind so when you ask them questions like that they know what the answer is now I know your River yeah cuz that's how you treated me in school as well well now I know I so uncharacteristically I run up and I hug her she hugs you back you're lucky to be alive she says I know somewhere privately yes all right we're uh do you have somewhere private we can talk as we don't we're heading that way on a walk with us you can come with us for a bit can we walk and talk sure please walk and talk we got places to be also should we take your horses we need to get there yeah sure let's take our so soul time so you've been working with the silver order and the hooded lanterns working with everyone but dabble you can summarize this what do you want to share with river what do you want to tell her as you walk mmm oh do you want to tell her everything you wanna be selective like what are things that you don't want to tell her if you're summarizing the story of um how you where you've been so far I'ma be honest I don't even want to tell her where we've been I just want to hear what she has to say because obviously she's approaching us for a reason I don't know this is one of my best friends okay we also kind of Awesome if he's about I know this is a question of are you guys gonna let Sebastian blab cuz Sebastian might tell more because he's talking to a childhood friend I think we need a group huddle yeah River ever give us some never we weren't expecting you we're on our way to stuff and and we're kind of busy yeah sure puddle we need a group huddle okay Sebastian what remember we're not sure about the endless Academy I'm sure about River I know but she her allegiances have so far been shown the amethyst Academy over us also we lost the bomb we shouldn't bring them no we really don't want to tell her about the bomb guys they're gonna find out about that one way or another if we lie continually lie about it I just want to tell her about it yeah and she also watched us and stuff she does like this for like not telling us information that we need so I'd like to see what she has to offer first before just giving her all over sings let us do the talking for a little bit and let's not tell her everything I can always tell her after we've killed everything in director but hey you guys tell her what you want to tell her I have a question for her once you're done telling her thing yeah I have more questions I'd rather ask her things then tell her things okay you know what go ahead I'm I'll keep my mouth shut no I want to hear you are you already with my question we're ready to talk yes we're ready to ask so what are you doing here ever I should ask you the same question I've come back because it's time for the next steps the Academy is ready to make a few moves in Drakon hime but it seems like now we have to reevaluate our position because of the help that you just gave to this over order and the amethyst account the silver order and the hooded lanterns River um amethyst Academy had a tower here back in when dragon I was a functioning City yes and the hooded lanterns were the guard of that city and they worked together why is that something that you would frown upon now working together with with people who also want to help the city Sebastian you're not a member of the amethyst Academy but you are a sorcerer and I know you didn't pay attention in history class but you don't happen to people like us before the amethyst Academy that part I have a bit of knowledge about you know what people like the silver order and the hooded lanterns did two generations of people that have had the gift but that was the ancestors of the people who are now dealing with and to hold them accountable for the same crimes that's not a good way to go about it Sebastian yeah Pluto I don't expect you to understand but oh I won't people are afraid of magic people are afraid the people who wield it and you know why that is because magic can destroy the world you and because of the power that we wield we have worked hard in the amethyst Academy to make sure that those who are born with gifts like yours like mine are found protected and taken care of and the most important thing the amethyst Academy has is that we are neutral politically across the entire world we have towers in the cities of caspia Illyria we had powers in western Mar we have towers far away in hepped and even a tower off in the Isles and all Bulls towers work together with the people that are there but the people of Drakon Heim people of Illyria our towers might as well be a prison as much as anything else there a place that we protect ourselves from the other people and other people think that we're protecting them from us and the only way we make it in this world the only way they their only reason why the Academy hasn't have been burned down like all the other operations hundreds of years ago that tried the same thing is because we run like a business and we are involved politically but neutrally with everyone else in this world and now in front of us here in Drakon Heim is one of the biggest opportunities that we have ever had one of the biggest chances that we have to make a better world for people born with our gifts for people born like us and no one else is going to let us have that the hooded lanterns aren't going to let us have it the silver order certainly isn't going to let us have it but there are thousands and thousands of young people all over the world that are born with a gift and if we knew that we could help them we need to can't do what we need to do in Drakon hime without risking our political neutrality know what river we weave as a group tried to stay politically neutral it doesn't exist in Dragon I'm you have to choose a side it's what's meant to be in Drakon hime to figure out who's gonna ultimately bring dragon hime into a new age and so far the amethyst Academy has really been so mysterious and secretive of their values and their intentions behind it I want to know where this speech was what weeks ago when we were wondering what that we were doing trying to figure out where we were in this I also do want to say that you haven't asked the hooded lanterns or the paladin's of the silver order if they're willing to work with you you're just making assumptions based on history I didn't really pay attention in history class but that's because I'm not one to care about what happened in the past except my past that I really care about it you're like super into it you bring it up all the time yeah that's right sir I mean old history not my history my history is important but you're ruining my point no I'm ruining my point I just get on top of it River helping you I don't I don't think we can Drakken hime just for the amethyst Academy I think there needs to be a collaboration that happens and yes magic scares a lot of people trust me I know that I grew up with that but magic also just saved a whole bunch of people back at temple gate a lot of people for the first time in my life are telling me that I did something good who's to say that we can't pave a new way for small County they only feel that way because you're useful to them in the short term but as soon as you become dangerous they turn on you immediately that's the way that people have always been treated that's that's the way that people in the Academy have always been treated and it's the way we continue to be treated people respect the Academy because we're useful they're afraid of us and they don't know what they don't know the secrecy of the Academy our reclusive nature has kept us alive and it's campus free of you and that's that they have respected us though and they've respected us properly and feared us enough to work with us but not so much they wanted to destroy us and if we act too rashly if we act too drastically if we show a moment of weakness there are people that would want to know all of our secrets to know all of our powers to know all of the things that we are hiding things that they don't understand that they're never going to know that they're never going to grasp we don't know the full extent of all the damage that has been done to Drakon hime we don't know if the city can be saved we don't know if the city or if delirium is something that is here to say or go but do you really think that anyone else is in any position to find out I think that if we're going to find out there needs to be teamwork got a were three of us you're talking to me a spellcaster who used to be a member of the amethyst Academy we have a Caspian here who's stood by my side since the moment I met him and bayo here has been my friend since childhood she's not a member of the amethyst Academy she never was she accepted me for who I was she always did well so who are you to assume that every person out there I mean yeah I got I got picked on a lot as a kid for being different for for being a spellcaster I caused a lot of problems and I was shunned because of that but the friends that I did make those alliances are the strongest I have and you are one of my closest friends River I know that it's been a long time and I know that we we don't talk like we used to but you've always been one of my closest friends and Sebastian doesn't matter what I think it's not my decision to make council has made the decision going to talk to you you while River when this eventually comes crumbling down and whatever happens in Jack and I haven't happens in Drakon arm I hope that no matter what happens between us that you still see me suffer helps her to you have to decide well now whether you're going to work with us reap the rewards of that or whether you want to go off on this little fantasy that three of you seem to have that everybody in the city can work together because to be honest council does not believe that the others in this city have the same interest in us and I'm I don't believe that either the silver order barely tolerates our presence in Illyria and their decree from the hierarch is that the Delirium his profane and they wish to destroy it that's what they're here for and they could do it that could be a good thing I disagree and so does the council the Delirium offers us a power and an understanding and secrets that we need to know fully and maybe it will turn out that we do need to destroy it but we will never know why this happened where it came from if there's more of it if it even can be destroyed if a bunch of gung-ho paladin's are going around destroying it at every turn sounds like you're meddling in things that might cause more damage than good and knowing that this council doesn't want to talk to anybody about their interests how is that any way to try to get anyone including a bunch of misfits like us on your side to help work with you the council is comprised of the greatest wizards of our age trust them and their knowledge and foresight more than anything else I'm sorry but they believe that we do not know enough about the Delirium yet to really determine whether it's even a good idea to destroy it and we don't know the silver order could go in there start destroying Delirium left right and center what if they caused a bigger problem what if they're unleashing something awful in the process of doing that what if they're knocking about in something getting it out in places in ways that it can't can't be used or controlled the Delirium is dangerous it defies those who want to control it so the only way to keep it safe is to contain the city and the only way the the only people that can do that is the amethyst Academy all the others they'll only be able to stir it or maybe survive and if the Academy is going to control the ruins of dragon Hein the only way we're going to be allowed to do that is if the other nations think that there's no other way and that's why it's so important this city looks like a hopeless situation to everyone else but us and now the silver order and the hooded lanterns have won a great victory because you helped them and now they've got hope they've got a belief that the city can be retaken that the city can be saved unless there's a major setback that we can pin on somebody else our chances of convincing anybody that were the only ones that can actually do something about this are slimming by the day and if you think that the silver order and the hooded lanterns can actually figure out what happened in this city I'm sorry but I know one person who's determined to figure out what happened to this city and where the Delirium came from that's me why I came back here well then work with us or you can work with me River we'd like to I'm not saying you is a we sing you River learn with me you what do you think I'm here to do I can follow you on this whole concept of the amethyst Academy ruling over dragonhide by themselves but I'll tell you what we can do help me get to the bottom of what happened with my mother which by the way I hope you have news of because that was the last thing that we talked about but if we can figure out because I believe deep down inside that's something about my mother my birth and the meteor is all connected perhaps if we can solve that together we can find out what the answer might be to our next steps forward amethyst Academy's attitude has been concerned because yes we did help them we helped the fitted lanterns we helped the silver order because we to believe that there could be a better new Drakon hymen I believe that you and even the amethyst economy could have a place in that and yes we do need answers and I think we can get them and that's what I'm here to do well we'll have to find out what those answers are next week aha that's great awesome thank you so much for quite an intense session that's all the time we have for tonight
