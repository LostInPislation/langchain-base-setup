med wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon heuerman caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome to castle Drakken when last we left our heroes they had gone from the from the ground levels of the castle sneaking in through the secret passages from the stewards tower in through the kitchens and into the crypts and vaults of castle dragon venturing deep below the foundations of the castle into the crypt of the kings of the vaughn castle line they found a horrifying chamber filled with the terrible delirium dredged fluids and haunted by a terrible monster indeed but they're fused into one of the pillars of Dragon hime itself they found Johan Eisner the former steward and ver Bao's father after an emotional reunion where Johan revealed that there is some entity in the throne room that he is wrestling with for control of the power of the castle our heroes ventured from the very depths of the castle having avoided fighting that terrible monster all the way up the grand stair to the top level of the castle keep itself where the Royal Apartments are there they encountered another demonic statue but this time of a demon that they had not spoken to before with dark words the demon said run I take pleasure in the hunt and the doors around you you're in the topmost Great Hall so this hallway vo is mirrored on every single one of the five levels of Castle drakon and they are all connected by the tower stare hmm which is the Grand Tower which actually stretches up half again as high as the top level of the castle itself and so this long hallway which stretches the whole length of the castle opposite you opposite that's the opposite you basically is to the south is a balcony which overlooks the main courtyard but in front of this balcony is the statue of this horned and muscular demon arrayed around it piles of corpses and bones behind you to the north the tower stair continues up to up to the very top spires of Castle Drakon with the secondary staircase tower going up right beside it and then to the west are a set of double doors that from what you recall these doors lead out onto the balconies overlooking the throne room and opposite you as well are a set of five sets of doors all sorry four sets of doors I can count my own notes that lead into the Royal Apartments themselves the doors are all shuttering and threaten to burst open every single door I actually had a crazy idea call his bluff I we hide behind the Orca statue and store new demon I keep him losing track of all the demons I moved behind him we all moved behind him and I move him with the telekinesis ring and then you guys mimic his voice and make like flares and stuff come out and then that way what ever comes out we just tell what to do you don't have too much time to decide okay we're going Thank You April words the statue has these doors burst from behind the doors come a sea of bags of these creatures monstrous does not even be able to describe the appearance of these creatures vaguely humanoid in shape they are hunched over some of them with their heads they have no necks their heads almost coming out of their body in fact one of them appears to just be a head with legs coming out of it one its leg is thick and knobbly the other is almost completely wasted away and bony and almost nothing all of them are bursting forward with boils and sores cancerous looking tumors vestigial limbs and tentacles one this tentacle comes up out from where its mouth should be and then it ends in another mouth that is chomping another these fleshy tentacles are just coming all up out of its back and they're in fact bursting with pus blood and other bodily fluids as they basically the best way to describe how they move they're almost trundling forward like a sea of roiling flesh as the doors burst open around you all part of the plan are we doing the plan we're doing it I guess do they see us or are we [Music] would you get [Music] a sea of flesh not even not even the weirdest thing we've seen I mean I agree like this is like this whole castles been a weird it's been a weird day 12 12 seven seven per Sebastian eleven okay so even though these things have basically no initiative bonus they all beat you oh but they don't know where we are yeah the sea is going I mean is chaotic I don't know the three of you now can all make stealth Jack's my favorite oh is how long does that last I'm gonna say that it's it's over now yeah unless it lasts for an hour it does okay then it's thanks sure it's still in effect boat race if it was ten minutes I would say no but if it's an hour than yes so we can all right yeah what do you got 26:23 nineteen okay it's not bad so as the doors first opened the three of you hide quickly behind the Statue of this demon as the door as all of these needy bags of pink and charred and bruised flesh come out into the hallways and begin gurgling and vomiting and making all these bodily noises guttural and as they do so you hear more chittering noises laughing both childlike giggling and low malicious laughter and this giddy Louie echoing down the hallways the creatures fan out down the halls and some of them smell some of them lick the floor tasting around for where their prey has gone what will you do okay you guys ready can we like all say what we want to do or do you want us to go an initiative order you are all three together and initiative order so what would you like to do okay so you're gonna I want to move the statue like slowly forward yes yeah I using the telekinesis ring I'm going to try to minor illusion its voice okay let us double check I can move up to a thousand pounds okay can you do like sparks or something what do you want me to like ready did an action to like murder these guys they see through it okay so you start to move the statue I'll do that Jesus yeah and then after them they've gone down the stairs okay nailed it I'm ready my longboat okay you're gonna move the statue with telekinesis okay Sebastian you can make a deception check get him twenty-one okay the creatures turn and none of them seem to be capable of speaking and they look up at you what language are you speaking as you say that is right under common they look up with this strange come with a complete almost lack of confusion like they don't understand the words that you said all right here's worth a shot they can some of them begin meandering towards the stairs as can you make it like no I guess now I could try yo [Music] as they do a whole descending down from the stairs and up from the stairs come a horde of strange-looking demonic creatures most of them are about 4 to 5 feet tall and they're bounding almost down the stairs on all fours they have these large bat-like ears and they seem to be covered in fur it's hard to tell if they are ape-like or canine or bovine almost a combination of all three but they kind of have this splayed open bat like face they bound down the stairs some of them also like the others having these tumors on their backs or vestigial tentacle on the side of their face they come down the stairs and they begin sniffing around as well do try again try a different language I know three and I mentally I'm like Pluto can use like translate in was it what languages do you know you know a vessel yeah can I can I teach him like just telepathically safe sounds into my head all right I give them something to mimic in infernal can i I teach them how to say they went down the stairs just repeat after me okay gosh rougarou's you're okay Sebastian you can make it you could repeat that already you're gonna make the deception check with this event girl you should all read God you know what it's they can tell that you're one from like the third ring of evil but you know what you can sell it I got a 10 a 10 as you do you hear this bellowing laughter coming from the statue ourselves smashed and it says in the abyssal tongue but in a way that resonates in your mind that you can understand it says this way my children come and feast and with the wet snapping almost like their necks are going to break they all turn towards the statue and begin moving towards it can I use my ready action to fire at them sure okay cool go veil go use my longbow 13 that's a hit hit the one that's closest to us on the left [Music] I messed up a few of the words I think yeah you know what it takes 31 damage to be able to speak okay infernal as your arrow pops into it it falls over to the ground and it almost begins bursting and it explodes as it vents gas from every orifice in its body and none of you are close enough but this this disgusting green gas extends out from from it and all around it it is destroyed hooray we only have to kill the rest of the sea now don't worry okay I got it fail I'm going to let you have your full turn okay so that you like you do now oh um like just continue with my first turn okay I'm gonna continue shooting at them [Music] another 13 also a hit [Music] 18 damage with a loud pop the arrow collides with one of the foils on its body but it's still keep my last shot 12 that is still a hit huh 21 damage same one with kind of this as it from the punctured wound with the second bolt lies this stream of pus and vile organs spew forth on the ground almost like a zit or a pimple had been pop and all the organs came out with it a gag a little bit as I see this and I say guys I'm gonna grab a different vantage point and I start to make my way was we're on a Ledge right that goes outside yeah the window beside is it open the window so you behind you are a set of French doors that lead out onto a balcony okay you can open these doors and look out on into the courtyard yeah if I could go through them and when I look to the right I see a window okay you step out into the courtyard of Castle dragon oh and you see soaring overhead in the courtyard is the bronze dragon and in through the rest of the courtyard but though but on the ground as well you can see as you looked outside sleeping in the middle of the courtyard was this gigantic Minotaur probably about 30 feet tall it was laying down on the ground outside sleeping don't go out that way oh is it is it just cold outside or what bad weather or hippy now from where you were out so you could probably leap over to the next balcony but there's also the doors that lead into the room beside you there um I'll hold off for now because I don't want to bring any more attention to her window that is my turn okay ludo what do you want to do um how close are they have they are they moving towards us they are they know we're here oh yeah yeah pretty much can i it says I can move the statue thirty feet okay in one action can I like launch it forward into the sea of everything um if you want to expend the energy of the spell to do so yes like for my action yes like I want to just like yeah launch it just just slide it into everything yes I do that so I just ready feet forward and I use the Schwartz I just I just okay on ship forward I'm gonna say that you launch it forward as high as it can and essentially it topples over and breaks and shatters yes take that how many are they a 10-foot radius around it 3-3 I'm gonna give them all dexterity saving throws which they spectacularly fail and they each take 66 points of bludgeoning damage roll it whoo do you need these X's there's three there's one more gracias so we ate so many ones 13 so they served by oh no they're still coming yeah oh I didn't do anything yeah she lands in the middle of the hallway and lands right on top of some of them I just pursue them and valuing it but they're kind of squishy and they don't really have bones so they kind of slither out from underneath it save us orcas your brother's a jerk okay Sebastian it's your turn now that the statue that I was cowering behind has been launched away and I just came forward I get in flash I'm in front of you I pull out the staff of power as it starts to crackle with energy and I hurl a fireball wild magic surge please yeah wait what missile tracking are we still doing yeah potted plant all right we got a 97 you've got that before it doesn't think so it turns out to be I was counted as zero okay oh so then that's 20 yeah well 97 or 20 is it or two well cuz you got two on the okay that make sense so 97 is you are surrounded by faint ethereal music for the next minute and 20 is you cast the grease spell on yourself grease them up so as I hurl this fireball into the midst of all these demons I look gross all three of you have to make dexterity see oh yeah oh no or fall thrown including me yeah 15:15 this is against Sebastian spell save DC oops sorry guys what is it it's 17 oh I passed oh I got an 18 sight grease just like explodes out of me and I slick my hair back and look over in veils just like okay how many ones did you get your fireball one two three four of the fleshy dudes and one two three four five six of the dogs yeah I think those dogs are okay so you got four fleshy boys yeah all the fleshy boys fail and the dogs two of the dogs six the two two of the they're they're wretches and wretches so - everyone's that too far one succeed and the others all the others fail and it's 26 right yes as this spurt of grease flies out of the staff of power and knocks veio to her feet it comes out the other end fire a [Music] fireball erupts in the middle of the hallway ascending I'm gonna use my meta magic scorching energy across these creatures the rolls on them boys yeah all right cool take it forty-two damaged nice saboom amazing okay so these creatures are all resistant to fire damage but it's a not enough to save them except for the two that are just outside the edge of the fireball so they are all annihilated by the fireball Wow well done leaving only ash and a faint smell of cooked meat in the air mm-hmm there's still there's still one squishy boy right here oh he wasn't in the fireball no he was that he was close to the eye I missed the guy closest to us boy which is great all righty so we go to the top of the round with our foes okay they launch themselves forward with the single-minded ferocity that only a demonic cordon have with no regard for their self-preservation whatsoever throwing themselves forward not far hungry hello and as they do so oh oh no oh oh this got scarier uh what some more enemies from up the stairs gums a hulking crimson skinned monstrosity it has four arms two of which are these small vestigial limbs that are what we call this doing the yeah yes they're just kind of holding the fists of their fingers together and pacing somewhat and then it's it has these on the top of its body almost coming out of where its shoulder blades would be are these massive muscular arms that end in crab-like pincers its face is this elongated visage combining the worst features of a pig and a dog and it walks forward on limbs that looks like it's skip leg day never skip leg day Nevers and it has this potbelly in front of it coming up beside it are these three smaller creatures with blue and black fur all of them have got like faces with long horns and their faces and instead of flesh on their faces it's just raw bone but there's something moving on top of the bony and you can see that there's this mass of maggots that are eating away the flesh of its face and all of these insects are coming out of its mouth and flies are flying in through all the wounds and sores on their bodies they bound forward and as they do so surrounding this whole group of creatures [Music] reaching up and all down the halls are hundreds of flies I mean good protein [Music] are we cornered I mean there's a balcony behind us so I think that if force comes to worse we have an escape plan no balcony don't go to the balcony why not the Belkin um there's a big Minotaur being scared right guy I got us in here I can get us out of here okay but let's try okay see we can do let's see over here as the large crimson skinned beast comes forward its fingers begin to this of that smaller hand runes appear around them as it enhance a spell and it begins saying words in a Bissel and it casts confusion on the three of you counter spell okay you counter spell it - wait you're using a third level slot yeah okay roll it is it a d20 yep your charisma modifier when he starts waving his hands I just look at Sebastian yep that's a 20 okay you counter spell him successful so I throw my staff up and I shoot runes out that block his ruins and they collide now that God and I'm good magic so the other three smaller creatures as they come forward they lash their tails which end in sharp bone spur like barbs day oh it is your turn I take out my bow and as a bonus action I cast Zephyr strike and I'm aiming for the big scary red guy did you stand back up and easy oh yeah I guess I have to stand up I stand up in the grease okay get my foot in cause half your speed that's a sorry about that I need a shower good thing we have to get out of the grease every time we have to make this 23 to hit what are you what weapon are you shooting with Wanda okay that is a hit whew [Music] 33 damage nice yes ever strike okay I take my second shot and Aveo 18 did also hang Tina woo 21 damage Oh it continues forward unabated by your shots was that the big guy we're having a lobster for dinner Bluto you're up I want to bring ignatius down on this wretched thing yeah is it what is it legs is it the top or the bottom half which one is this one it looks like it stopped as its bottom and its bottom a stop and it's inside as it's outside I completely missed trying to judge and so I swing wildly okay not sure where like the vital parts are so you just it's so confusing I take a moment 17 very solid it I wanted to try not to kill it okay and I did that successfully 4 3 3 so I get 12 damage okay it isn't this one was one of the ones though that was crushed earlier by you throwing it at it so it is destroyed okay and I want to make it make a strength save okay it gets a six so I want it I want to use one of my maneuvers to like stab it and right before it dies I want to kick it 15 feet away with my pushing attack okay I'll allow that so as you kick it back it bursts into this gas get away and then I'm just gonna stand I'm gonna just go ten feet ahead and stand in the in front of my friends cool sounds good Sebastian you're up I'm sending this lobster man back to where he came from Sebastian's eyes go black and you hear the howl of a hound as out of a portal from the abyss a hound jumps and attacks the back of this dude cool and then I cast mental prison on him interesting play she has disadvantage on his which cancels his magic resistance okay fair enough oh you don't want to come on oh I'm so sorry that really sucks to lose mental foot prison in that way does it do anything even when they succeed I think it does a ton of damage on a failed save the target takes five to ten physical damage and you make the area immediately around the targets etc etc if the target is on a successful save it still takes five decent psychic damage okay yep yep yeah all with it so you still get some change back yeah this wasn't a waste of spell five to ten and once again I'm going to use a sorcery point to re-roll three of those okay 39 damage the mental anguish of even the the idea of being mentally imprisoned ravages its mind I actually not terrible that it's still like doing that much damage on a failed save as' yeah not as it is actually failing but you know you take your licks where you can get out and Reapers gonna bite him okay Jim Reaper get him I got a seven okay Reaper does not bite him Reaper is gnawing on his exoskeletal arm he probably knows him yeah they're old pals like he's having a hard time Reaper grab like a bone near him yeah Reaper stop any I'll Sebastian no I'm gonna stand with my staff out trying to look as tough as possible i i'll walk 5 feet up to look cool ok the LZ factor great the demons oh here they come hello demons [Music] tell me huh i brace myself that's kind of scary [Music] oh no does Reaper get an opportunity attack get him Reaper 13 it's not a hit they walk forward and as they do the flies thicken as the dote like demons continue and you all feel this rotting presence as the flies begin flying over top of each of you and biting you they're like massive black flies but as they each come in to bite you they burst into necrotic energy the large pincer like one as it steps forward [Music] it looks at veo and Sebastian and it utters a single word of abyssal a horrific truth of the universe rings out in your mind though as you are hit with power word stun oh like try counter it you can attempt to do so please what are you gonna what are you gonna cast a net right third I'm low on most higher stuff right now and I want to save those for 21 that is awesome so again as he starts to utter the words I hold out the staff and my own little purple rooms appear and they absorb the magic as things towards Vale yeah Oh Sebastian though it is your turn wink and I had to say you know what I'm really tired of this lobster speaking and I take my ring of spell storing and I cast silence on him boom BAM no more verbal component that's interesting interesting okay yeah I think is there a saving throw for it I don't think there is I believe it's just an area yeah that will end your passive oh yeah and oh yeah you Jews ever starting these choose a point not a creature yeah yeah so the spot that he's on yeah okay super anything else Sebastian you got this I which part the little ones against the door like not through the balcony door but as far back as it okay Bluto you're up I'm going to misty step to Diamond dude nice ice and then I yell ignatius but no one can hear me and you just see me mouthing like and screaming a bunch of infernal slurs kidding a 17 that is a hit oh god I had to use a battle maneuver okay so he's gonna take but it was a good one you appear before him and beside the statue and with a quick adjustment cut deeply into his potbelly 28 damage nice he's still not destroyed by that excuse you and I'm gonna hit him again for another 17 to hit also a hit for 17 damage and I want him to make us strength save [Music] he gets a 20 I'm sorry 928 818 oh that's the saves but he still takes 8 damage and veil and veil and I need Constitution say any threads from all of you because you are all in the aura of the of the Flies Oh Constitution 6 6 29 29 okay so veil you take 10 points of necrotic damage but the rest of you don't take any I try I got a seven you got a seven on your con save ya okay you also take 10 points necrotic damage it hurts I'm so focused on murdering okay I did your third attack it I really haven't sold it yet okay you took another eight damage from the manoeuvre and I'm just gonna try to end it died demon thing I get a 3418 damage you teleport behind him and with three quick strokes bisect him into three sections and the three parts of him collapse to the ground but you can't even say nothing personal kid and I say and you see me and I coyly go save the meat we'll have a barbecue later and then I'm gonna run back towards behind these these demon things so I start cutting right charging behind them now what am I gonna do Oh as you go to me you must mine all of the demons is there slain their bodies putrifying now and turn into that black muck and it drains out and kind of flows into the cracks no extent Sebastian you're you're up yeah you know what I'm also gonna go ahead with what I was gonna do do you think I hold up my shield I know it's happening so I'd like to echo my shield a little bit it's fine he's fine okay what's your uh what's your wisdom like just trust I'm super wise so as as Pluto started running back I'm lifting in the air and my eyes are turning black and all of these snakes spiral out of me these black shadowy snakes and I cast hypnotic pattern out from here onto all of these guys okay I hope that they can be kept not hypnotized that's the word hypnotise okay the goat ones seem completely unfazed by it but when I yells before I do it can I yell for Pluto to close his eyes or is it too late it is too late ok Pluto sorry you ran into this I read I ran right in the zone of silence so he can't quite hear you [Music] so how many other creatures do I have in that area four five and they also all have to make wisdom saving throws with their lovely minus ones yes they all family yay 21 baby so wise okay I got real so I'm so happy so the goats are fine now right the goats are immune to being charmed cool okay yeah but the rest of them are hypnotized as I lower back down to the ground and make eye contact with the goat guys and go oh no they just keep coming you're only three goats all leap forward to attack Sebastian oh I did not see this coming I'm gonna take a swing at one of them lashing out with their barbed tails I crit one of them okay I get a 15 to hit Sebastian and a 17 to hit Sebastian and a 21 to hit Sebastian one of them hits cuz I cast shield but I crit one so it can't move anymore okay I will roll a d3 and see if and on a five or six is the one that he actually hit hmm it is not the one that actually hit okay still take it Sebastian so you take you take 12 points of piercing damage from the barbed tail and I need a constitution saving throw from you sir oh no the hypnosis 17 you succeed and a concentration check concentration shop yeah well that dice is gone it's not coming back 29 12 succeed okay nice you are not diseased or broken concentration alrighty bail over to you sorry um I see the goats and I take my long ba and I aim shouldn't over my shoulder as they the three of them they don't even use their arms or limbs to attack they just swipe at Sebastian with these barbed like tails that break into his face that he can barely defend with the shield 14 ahead nice sneak attack because Sebastian is a rapist you're welcome I'm distracting them with your body do your fan dance that's it give me a little more [Music] nice 37 damage Oh that rips its face off and it collapses to the ground oh thank you you do need to take a constant Constitution saving throw though to avoid the necrotic damage 10 take another 10 necrotic damage is it an attack no it's their aura of flies that are flying out of their bodies these days and then my second attack yep 25 also ahead yep [Music] 24 damage it survives that hit though and it by itself how much damage did you do with your cred 42 that's it did that does I kill the one that he created oh no it's the one in front of you no but then also we never established what oh the one that it's but they're both bloodied okay yeah okay yeah good I'm coming after it okay is your turn I'm coming Sebastian yes the one in front of me it's pretty bloody both both the remaining ones are flooded I get a 23 to head for 19 damage now what happened so I get it I catch it in the leg when it tries to run a Sebastian and then I'm just gonna pull up the sword and just slice it in half like the horizontal side and then I'm just gonna start these ones are all hypnotized around me yeah so I'm gonna jump over them and go after the one right beside Sebastian and I get a 19 for 22 damage swiftly beheaded and head melts on the ground and then that you can as I jump out of the zone of science you hear me like mid like did you I think I'm just yelling infernal profanities and I get a sixteen against this thing yeah four aah this thing just whatever's around you yeah it is it is first 22 days destroy and then I'm and and I'm just swinging ignatius wildly at everything that moves with the remainder hypnotized you're able to finish them off yeah the halls go silent for a moment the statue toppled on the ground and the the fluid remains of the demons slithering away down the cracks and the arteries of the halls several of them pooling around the doorway to the to the throne room where as the as the silent spell ends and the sound comes back in the full room you can hear this high-pitched ringing noise the sound of jingling crystals and what sounds like someone retching coming from the throne room no guys I think we need to go see what's in there I think we do too that's literally been our mission was to scout this castle and find out what's in the throne room the good news is all of that stuff is hopefully gone now for next time we come back unless they just create more because of the goo yeah the goo I don't know how magic works but the goo kind of freaked me out a little bit yeah at least we know we can handle it I'm gonna Baio do you want to check it out I don't want to clunk in there and tell me sneak in did you want to just take a quick peek or you could sing Crowley Oh Carly would be good idea okay yeah if we can open the doors I can send curly in the doors are open oh is it the flood if I like walk over and kind of peek through can I see like is the throne room open there is a small hallway after these double doors where a pair of attendants would have once stood and guards and then another set of doors which are broken away that lead out onto the balconies the floor here is covered in ropey tendrils of flesh I am I go back and I'm like all right Pluto just make sure that I'm okay and then my eyes go like roll back in my head and I kind of like slink over to the ground and croley sores okay I'm gonna do the room and perches on the corner limping around in the balcony of this room are more of these mutated creatures you can see some of them still have bits of clothing on them what looked like the remains of courtiers outfits bits of jewelry and rings this was once the grand throne room of castle drakon a two-story a two tiered room almost 60 feet in height there is a grand vaulted ceiling which matches up with the roof of Castle drakon itself and the large semicircular balcony with battlements style railings from which people could look down down on the King below you is the massive hallway that the great murals paintings golden mirrors and all the artwork of the vaulted ceilings here is covered over by masses of writhing flesh and sores and coming up from the pillars that hold up this grand chamber jut forth massive crystals of delirium as you as Crowley's vision looks up from the down in the throne room itself the main audience hall has a massive platform of shaved delirium so it's like peace of delirium have been cut in half and formed into a platform upon which is this rune encrusted assemblage of bones and flesh that form a pentagram leading up to the steps to the throne continues this amalgamation of flesh bone and chains chains which reach up from the ground and wrap around the crystals of delirium almost like anchors and as your vision tracks up the throne you can see splayed out across the steps and reaching up are these chains which hold in the pincers of the chain floating in the air chained to a piece of delirium are several organs a heart a brain lungs a liver a kidney and a ribcage bones and strands of flesh and dangling from the one that is just a brain is the jeweled crown of Westham our on the throne you can't even see the throne there's just this mass of tumors and tentacles 30 feet in width bloated with layers of fat and flab bursting sores crawling with flies and mucus blood bile and that black fluid leaking out of it there is a massive MA some five feet wide filled with teeth and oh under a fold of fat there is a distended I kind of looking out from it the whole mass of flesh is actually floating off the ground suspended in the chains and as curly perches on to the chamber this aura of contamination washes over the entire chamber and it singes Crowley's feathers and you have the sense that if he came even any closer than 30 feet he could melt just by the raw presence of corruption that fills this chamber the creature before you is muttering speaking in tongues and and in a Bissel and as it does so pieces of flesh spew from it and turn into the creatures that were meandering throughout the chamber and walked out through the the doors below what oh man King so I relay most of that information back to you as best I can it's mostly just me being like oh it's not good so I god the King there's a crown and there's there's a king here he's everywhere he's the throne there's the chains guys it's not good it's really not good Kerli get back here sounds like the king we once knew he's no more so cruelly comes back and perches on my shoulder and I like come back to I have a plant listening around that throne room now okay my plan could be horribly flawed so I'll tell you the plan and then I'll tell you the possible flaw plant around the throne room are several large chunks of delirium we know that blowing up chunks of delirium can cause mayhem to creatures in the area the thing I don't know is whether this thing is strengthened by delirium that being said so was Oscar but that much delirium at one time kind of messed him up there are a few of these wretches up on the balcony and croley got a little singed when he went near the edge of the balcony but I'm thinking as long as we stay up on that balcony we could kill three wretches is it because Crowley isn't isn't is he we had the awkward delirium though you think that will make a difference The awkward delirium in the aqua RCX aqua exposure a mite what do we know about the the ritual I'm gonna contact Ulrich what do we what do we know about like do we need the throne because if we need to clear the throne there's something in the way tell Rick replies Eldrick replies and says in order to use the power of the castle we need the crown the throne and the seals okay well we the crown we found it we found the crown and the throne I wish that I could show you is there any way that you can like look through my eyes I don't know you can describe what you saw all right let me tell you let me paint you a word he's getting better he's getting better at telling the story all right Eldrick imagine is big imagine a throne room but imagine it made of flesh with chains holding up body parts and there's a brain and it has a crown on it and there's a big moss spitting out demons a lot of inside parts are outside right now yeah picture like the largest human amount of flesh you've ever seen and then turn it inside out and make it even scarier what do you suggest mr. pentagram in the room yes I'm nodding but like probably is a legendary being a creature formed only around a place where the rifts between worlds it is a conduit by which beings from realms of chaos untold can enter our world it is quite literally a cancer a planar cancer that infects our world I'm gonna ask you a question and I'm kind of worried that I'm not gonna like the answer do you first see this as a we need to deal with this before we bring everybody in or is this we can altogether deal with it at once the three of you our strong of body will and mind this being that you approach could break you and you could become a slathering monstrosity in minutes being even exposed to it it must be destroyed but the cost could be very high it could turn any of you into an idiot a slathering beast a monster it is literally a womb upon a cancerous womb upon which demons are birth my father has been fighting this thing for 15 years on his own guys we can take it any any uh any tips Eldrick for how to survive this one if we're about to send us into what could be our death we could maybe read your greatest spells and defences prepared I use them all to get here can I be completely honest with you Sebastian yes if you do not have your greatest tools at your disposal you may not survive to a rest first guys I think we build a tiny Hut no I think I think we can take this but I think maybe it's time to go back to Ackerman mill and tell them what we've discovered yes I think we've we've cleared away to the throne room we might have to come back here and deal with this before we do the final push but well I mean everyone's help I'm not not gonna lie to you guys I also I also want to say goodbye to my family before I you know walk into your demise yeah I wasn't gonna say that but yeah yeah we were all thinking it and you thought it too didn't read your thoughts cuz I don't know guys this is it and we got to do what has to be done we have to take this on but I agree we need to be at our best I think I could use a little sleep maybe one more one more sleep if we're at the Stewart's tower is that above the haze or is it in haze you cannot rest you cannot take a long rest anywhere within Casa crack and are the effects of the haze we have to get out of here okay pick up some more expert you Eldrick we're coming home and will brief you on everything we've discovered very well you've seen the depths and the heights of Castle Bracken if you're I hope that you just have the strength to make it back I can do that I guarantee ya oh wait why what I don't understand just French doors guys I can have fly a dragon yeah I don't know sure what's the worst that can I do not stop saying that that was you went from super confident to I don't know and then what's Thor's that could happen what's the worst that could happen is what I say when I am trying to pump myself up to imagine that I'll do better than die I have survived this long with my horrible mistakes I'm going to get us out of here okay now based on what I know if we went back to the bottom of the stewards tower is there a way out from there or does that secret passage just connect to it so you know the passageway that leads back to the stewards tower and from the stewards tower you would you could exit yes like the stewards tower has an exit on the ground level that leads into the courtyard and then from the court like normally you would just walk out the courtyard walk out the gates and walk out the gates again but there's a dragon and the giant Minotaur that live in the courtyard why say we walk out onto that balcony I turn into a giant eagle and we fly the dragon is a construct we have potentially imagines a chance of controlling it is it looking for us probably but just peek outside just one more peek just take a peek you know what okay and my eyes roll back again and Crowley flies out onto the balcony I I do like that what you would do to like like an animal out like I just opened the door a little bit and then complicit right behind him looking at with Prolia onto the courtyard you don't see the dragon flying around anymore until you look back and it's perching back on top of the power stare like that like the tallest tower yes so it's it's far away no it's literally on the tower that's connected to the building that you're in yeah but that's like a hundred feet right what gives us 100 feet hundred feet up so it would be able to dive okay if we were way along the building to the furthest it is a mobile up balcony I can do it you want to well why don't we go from the stuarts ladder because if we go from the I mean wow that's such a long walk towards tower is further out compared to this yeah let's go back to my my dad's turn all right I think that should be good I have a lot of faith in my flying ability is there any other dragons purse up or they all perched where they would all returnable their pursuers Tower okay bye guys yes we need to remember because when we fly in here we should try to get to either this balcony or maybe one of the balconies on this level when we come back if the Dragons wake up we'd be closer to the Dragons where it's the Stewart star we can at least go down once we have the throne those dragons are our friends so we can just manipulate them now with our badges as long as we don't take five of them again we never had to fight five of them I don't want to wait okay I told you that I would get us to the throne room and I did you did it's true God have some faith my name is Sebastian Crowe a sorcerer now we need to get home yeah yeah so let's go back to the stewards tower and we can do eagle fly out of there because he's kind of waiting it sounds like he knows like I think he knows that we're in no because there's a dragon lost us one real I mean I mean we are actually melted into the floor again right I don't you let curly back in he's like fluttering against it flies back to my shoulder okay guys let's go all right and then I start to rush to our sisters and okay leg day you're heading down the stairs to the ground level back to the stewards okay through the wires you can roll me a d6 please what's the worst that could happen live so it's not five three okay I know it's triple ones this time okay the three of you head down the stairs are you taking the tower stairs or are you taking the the smaller stair well what's more inconspicuous smaller stair okay you take the small stairs down which lead all the way down to the kitchens again where the remains of your previous battle are still bleeding out heading through the chambers and back towards the wine cellar as you pass by one of the crystalline eyes opens back up and it winks back at you they'll I go up to it and I like kneel down and I say we found what we needed to we're coming back soon to save you I think once if you understand it blinks once I got this I can communicate with my dad's magical eye all right it's doing great yes love you dad I'll be back blink once if you love me too it was and you hear almost a bit of a this raspy whisper down down the hall that that just it sound it just sounds like the bluster of wind going down the hallway but it almost sounds like your name is being said sudden got windy in here how did you hear that no just winds just and I point to the eye again it's like don't make this hard I'm coming back for you don't worry I know where you are now and we're bringing back up and I like stand up and I'm like trying not to cry I'm like be strong and I like very stiffly like start to move towards the door did the wind just say viel BAE said day oh you said days that they guys don't lock my father we're just what that would just write her in something on the wind you head back out towards the wine cellar one more as you are stepping in one of the bottles of wine pops open and the wine spills out on the floor and it says the words spill out the seals bring to me to me you want the seals well I guess we have to kill a monster in the basement first darn it okay we can do it or we could just bring them the seals do we need the people with the seals though we need to okay well really it will relay that information as well and come up with a plan mr. veo will be best moved around and it says on the wine says no no no kings no kings and it said end spilling around once more that's only death the words swirl the crown is a curse what okay guys I'm gonna I'm gonna throw something out there that everybody's gonna hate what if this is the queen of Thieves messing with us with us okay are there any eyeballs around no go back to one of the eyeballs I think you should just me we're not gonna go together okay we'll go together we need confirmation I don't trust anything but the eyeballs okay I got I go back to the eyeball and I say okay I'm back I didn't really leave but I'm back was that your message blink once for yes yes okay let's go thanks mr. eyeball man there's other people who can communicate through wine so it's not really the most secure channel is not the most secure communication channel it's heavy unreliable I just don't trust anything right now because I know the queen of Thieves wants to make a play for something and I just thought getting us here alone with all the badges and not going for the crown could have been like a play so sorry for my caution okay let's get the heck of it well go back to the wine I say are we still a channel one yeah and the wine the wine does it says yes um I say what curse the thing you saw the thing is from delirium not from the crown the wine kind of spills around and says no difference can never be easy can it it can't just be like get the crown sit in the throne save Drakon hime it's always like a prophecy or like a demon brother and I go back to the wine and I say there are people that are not going to like this how can I convince them I don't know oh yeah we have to thank you for the heads up dad it's nice chatting with you it's been a while I miss you okay goes a little hard oh I am going to save you don't it's great okay as you head back down the passage towards the stuarts to the basement of the stewards tower and you had are you gonna try and fly out yep okay let's go to the top of the stairs and peek at the balcony okay we'll see if you escape after the break and we are back from our break but before we jump back in I

you going to escape you guys want me to okay if we can crawl out crawl out I guess we can walk onto the balcony yeah and I turn into a giant eagle and we just get out of here as fast as possible okay how big is the doorway to the balcony can you turn into a giant eagle here and do like a little like bird shuffle I am a large beast bird shuffle or should we like jump off the ledge and have you polymorpha midair for the cool factor yeah oh very talking my language we fall it's fine I mean if you guys think it would be faster we can literally just burst through these doors jump yeah I want to ride you out as a human I want you to piggyback me I can't carry you you are wearing a lot of armor what's the point okay what if you carry I carry you and then when you turn into the ego Sebastian you just like put your hand on my shoulder yeah then we'll jump that's all i'ma do and then I'm gonna bird trying to elevate it explore you jump but you hold on around Sebastian's neck and I'll hold on around your neck and we'll jump you're like skydivers I mean what's got you giving up you know like feather fallers yeah yeah yeah you need like someone's help if they're doing it so what are you gonna do we're standing outside the doors to the balcony mm-hmm and it sounds like we are going to burst through the doors mmm jump off the balcony and I'm gonna turn into a giant eagle okay it's solar I mean we don't have to do it in the air though actually feel I could do it in here that's just what if like somehow there's like an anti-magic field all of a sudden or like that just whatever this is castle dragon listen if there's a I have my hook shot okay guys we're doing three two one there's a crash you leap out off the balcony and Sebastian turns into a majestic giant eagle and the two of you land on his back you are flying since you are leaping off the balcony as if you were and this tower is on the outer walls of the castle if you fly north you're just clear immediately I fly north okay all of you roll a d6 triple one two three six as you run there is a roar and bolts of lightning as the dragon on the tower flaps its wings but does not pursue you I turn around and I flip him the bird shake your tailfeather with your claw my wing just kind of does like a little and then I I soar off like as each rewards Beckerman mill I always fall alright banks I am sad that I'm leaving my father still fighting in the tower we'll be back cool yeah okay okay with that you fly across the city and back to the Ackermann oh yes we purge on the way you bird perch and we regular perch yes off your back I'm aiming for like the rats Bowl ya know they'll just feed on it Oh true well it's a gross sight but yes we've heard on the way and then we landed Ackerman melt okay it is late in the evening by the time we return and the guards on patrol welcome you back there is immediately a flurry of activity as you return and people want to attend to you who do you want to talk to you alone what do you want to do we need to do the council again yeah we need to rest too though can we like I [Music] don't know if there's there's a few people I've been meaning to talk to but maybe I should talk to them before we set out again maybe the council's most important first to let everybody know what's up and then afterwards we can break and talk to those that we need to talk to before we sleep go back to the castle after we sleep yeah it's a sleep last talk to people first yeah we first thing in the morning okay um I gather my soldiers around and say is Eric arrived they reply and say we expect him in the morning okay where's the kitchen there's a camp where they're making all of you where's this Teague hmm I make my way over are we gathering the main people together or should we bring them to the stew okay III go to algae get the stew and I'm like we're meeting in the kitchen we're gonna eat and rest but we have some things to talk about if you could get some people together absolutely we'll gather everyone together it sounds like you've discovered much sure have a lot of discoveries today a lot of firsts I really need to eat my feelings right now okay that's fair so we gather everybody around as we kind of sit there with blankets on eating stew and we first of all tell them the tale of everything that went on inside the castle are you telling them absolutely everything or is there any details that you want to withhold because this is where this is where the queen of thieves comes in well we can we make sure there's a yeah I first actually before I start telling the story I asked al Jake I'm like Eldrick have we this place is warded off it is indeed I've been placing the wards in place every day and there's been no I did no funny business here at the camp regarding beyond the worsening of Queen Lenore's condition there has been and what we suspect might be some people watching us from afar nothing okay [Music] I'm going to I'll decide this in a moment but I'm gonna tell them everything about I mean are you guys okay if I tell them everything about what we found in the basement um everything except the last thing that your father said to us before we left I think I'm open to tell them everything except what the wine told us yeah I don't know gluto yeah I have no uh I don't know if I have any stake in it so I think it's important that okay we engage we say that we tell everybody everything except the last bit that fails dad told us and I'm gonna leave that to veo to tell what she wants to so as I tell them about the basement the horrifying monster I told about the eyes the Minotaur's the demon statue that isn't orcas the fleshy monstrosity and the throne room and what the throne room looks like the dragon there's a dragon the Minotaur sleeping in the yeah in the dooryard and then I tell them to tell the tale many are shaking their heads Saul Jackson crosses his arms and just to like he's got a brooding furrowed brow as he listens to the details that you described and you could hear a pin drop in the room as you describe the horrors that you saw in castle dragon I get to the point in the story where we were just leaving and the wine happened and then I turned to Vale and I'm like is there any details you wish to add to this tale I know that going back we need to go back one more time I think it's too dangerous for us to go together but we're I think to defeat whatever happened in the throne room we're gonna need the seals so LLL drag ass so are you asking us all to come with you I don't think it's safe for everyone who do you want to leave behind I like Pole I I grabbed Pluto and I pull him back we were told not to bring them we were told just to bring the seals do you think that's a bad idea yes I shove Pluto up and I grab Baio and I call her fail Pluto thinks it's a bad idea that we leave them all behind what do you think I don't know what to think but my father says we need to bring the seals he he didn't say we and just to make sure he said not to bring not all kings no kings but he didn't say that we couldn't bring reinforcements the people who are holding the seals at the same time I mean all the council's but we're like we did like a huddle we like you know just trying it out or having a conversation play charades and I I I go into great detail as how I decapitated a lobster monster as he's describing that me and Vale inside it had claws I did I I think what my father was saying is not that we can't bring people we need the seals but I think George needs to stay behind at the same time I think that the people that we've gathered here are some of the most important people you know jaqen hime and as much as I hate to admit it and I'll never say this out loud to any of them they're more important than us and it was really read were expendable we are if I die there can be a new Archmage River can take that up for fordragon hime if you die we can default too and an summer or Petra being the Lord Commander if Pluto dies we still have George for the throne I think us going in on a suicide mission I'm not against that I just how are we gonna get the seals we need the seals if we're gonna do this we need to maybe tell them the truth I know that's not in my vocabulary usually but I don't I don't know I feel like I'm over lying I okay but Vail you're my best friend and I'm gonna trust you whatever whatever you think we need to do and it's broken a bizzle people are holding on to Pluto's words as the two of you confirm to the side whatever you think is right I'm going to save your father with you whatever it takes I trust that my father has the most knowledge about what needs to be done he is not in the mood for figuring out who's gonna own rule dragon hime after he just wants to save it now and I think if he's telling us we need the seals to him we need the seals to him okay we'll go back there and all that you tell them what you think is right and we'll follow your lead okay then we step back as Pluto is finishing and then and then I I was yelling a bunch of stuff but I don't think anyone heard me because I said all this cool stuff and like no one really acknowledged it we just kind of bummed me out but it was dead anyways and that's how I killed it and all of that was true thanks man I was there I don't know what he said um okay so so my father has been in the castle this whole time fighting what is in the throne room the last message he sent us before we left was that no Kings should come to Dragan home in the castle but we need the seals to get to him and I think what what he's been fighting all these years he is the best authority on how we can defeat it and if he's saying we need the seals to get to him I think that's our next move Saul Jackson speaks up so you're saying girl that instead of us destroying that monstrosity on the throne clearing the way and putting my grandson up on the throne letting him do what it not must be done investing him with the power of the seals that you want to bring these to your father the former steward and what what is he going to do next sir Jackson if you could refer to her as Lord Commander that would be more appropriate Thank You Sebastian what I'm saying is my father said that there is no difference between the madness of delirium and the crown putting your grandson on the throne from what my father I gather what he says is going to do more harm to him than good more harm to Drakon Heim than good and until we can figure out how we can restore a king to the throne I don't want to put your grandson's life at risk but I do know that we need to defeat what is on the throne I just had a thought the queen of Thieves wants to take the throne if we free Bao's father defeat the monster that's under there and bring the seals to him he's more knowledgeable than anybody else about what's going on in the castle he's been there for 15 years if what he says is true and all that he's really been able to tell us is that the crown is a curse and there's no difference between the Delirium and the throne the queen of Thieves wants to make a play for the throne if the throne and the crown are a curse then maybe letting her make her play and taking the throne is the right move and seeing what it does to her almost like a guinea pig it's a it's a risk that's a tremendous risk says Elbert a tremendous risk indeed who knows what could happen the what you describe in that room the contamination the corruption our things only spoken of in the grimmest legends tales of demonic encroachment infestations from other worlds beings of chaos and madness trying to find a foothold in our world and the fact that this creature has entwined itself around the throne the crown and perhaps even what remains of the King means that whatever connections it has woven we will not know the full extent of those until it is destroyed and we can study it I think our first move is to learn what we can from vales dad which means that we should listen to him at least to the point where we can help him I must simply reiterate the original stance of the amethyst Academy with regards to the city of dragonhide and state that this is a fallen city and the restoration of the crown and this castle could never occur here the extent of this corruption is unfathomable and could and even if you destroy these creatures it could be years of work before we have unraveled the magic that they have wrought here we have no way of knowing whether anything that you do is safe I don't disagree this isn't about dragon time anymore this is about Westham our or even further this could be about the whole world I think stopping what's happening in castle track and it's not just for us here it's for everyone it's true but what if there was a way to capture this creature what if there was a way to bend it to our own will or study it in some way we could actually find out where it came from why it's here the silver order jumps to conclusions they destroy things without thinking they do not know where it came from they don't seek the answers and as such they are always fighting battles Eldrick you've read a lot of stories a lot of scary monsters you've told me yourself that you've never been out in the battlefield you're not a battlefield mage you don't you don't go into combat you have no idea the things that we just saw in that castle what was in that throne room I can describe it a hundred times to you but you have no idea what it was like to look at that thing I don't think it's a smart idea to let it keep existing I think that for the good of this realm for the good of everyone we need to do everything we can to destroy what is happening in that castle I must agree with you that that creature whatever it is is a cancer and it must be removed but from my perspective I do not know if we have enough information to act and to bring George or even to bring the seals of the city all in one place altogether and potentially if you go in there the three of you with all the seals of the city and die where does that leave us then the Queen has them there's a spell on the underside of these seals that the queen of thieves has put into place that if they were to be left somewhere then they would teleport back is there any way that you and River can spend the night reconfiguring these spells so that if the three of us die these return here we would need the original gem that they're bound to to do that the queen of Thieves she needs someone else to have these it is in her best interest not to hold them for herself mm-hmm we've already done the legwork to find the people if the three of us die well she can find three more very well beyo can I talk to you privately let me tell you all the story of the time I saw a crazy King beholder yes I trust your dad means well but as I look upon Queen Lenore and I think back to the corruption that sought through her from merely being in the presence of the gardens of dragon high I don't want your judgment clouded by something that could be nefarious running through him I thought of this gluto I thought what what could have happened to his mind in there he could have done so many other things when I saw him if it wasn't him I think what he's asking is true so he's not trying to get us to bring all the seals to him I don't see why he purpose unless he's no okay and I was invisible but I hid on the stairs and veil did most of the work and I didn't really see much cuz I was cowering I mean I was bravely observing and keeping an eye on danger and that's how we got out of there it's all true what he said Thank You Pluto well should have asked my dad more questions while we were there well we question is do we need all the seals he said we did we don't have one of them the crowd know the ring that wasn't a seal wasn't the rings are issued to the members of the royal family they're not part of the small council seal okay we have we don't need that I thought that's what the queen of Seas had she just stole my nice ring I mean it wasn't mine really was creme Lenore's I was safe keeping it until such a time that I felt like giving it back but I lost it before then so um what do you guys think I I'm just trying to think out what the play is because we could all go in without George kill the monstrosity that is guarding your father and present him with the seals we could blow up the throne room thing I don't know how to describe it blow it up like or kill it we could study it like art Eldrick Eldrick these these everyone wants to study these these aren't like bugs you can take home I we really need to kill it I'm not studying anything in that castle that castle needs to and we can put George where he belongs like I have to align with my father in some way like why deviate from the plan we knew what we wanted to do we knew we had a mission to get in there we learned what we needed to learn we can now go what we were set out to do I just wonder why why would my father tell me that it's dangerous to have a king if there's not some value to his words and that's why I really do have to trust if you trust him but I know what I've seen with Queen Lenore and the way we don't know how connected he is to this throne room abomination what if this corruption is seeking in and he may not be speaking as himself how are we gonna know that we only know it by maybe just killing that thing but if we go in there and kill the thing and have all the seals with us we can I mean what's the statue gonna do to us there's always a way out we could that's why I I think we could bring the council I just don't want any of them to die because we thought it was a good idea to go back into the castle I'm wondering maybe should we go back in take care of what's in the basement and have more than silver and have more conversations with my father and bring the council's that's an idea it's a way that we're not rushing in cuz I see the value in what you said Pluto like my father's mind has been part of this but I can he's been fighting he's been fighting this whole time and I can't not do everything in my power to to try to save him but I also know that things may not be what they seem and so the other option is killing that throne-room mumbo-jumbo mr. inside-out and that could also free for your father I think we need more information about what my what what information my father has about this thing we are still on an Intel mission and I think the gaining Intel about what we're about to face before we go into that throne room that throne room is scary and I think our best bet is to learn everything we can before we go barging in there trying to blow things up there's other parts to castle Drakon way out is there anywhere you would go when the city was bustling to learn about these types of would they say like a like two lines of evil have passed there it's a good like a channel from another world like where would that information be held I didn't really study much libraries of the amethyst Academy yeah there are resources that we can could consult and I could confer with others of the Academy to see if we can find out anything about this creature what weaknesses it might have what preparations we can put in place or what protections might be necessary I say that we go we free up the basement well we gain Intel well Eldrick gains Intel the rest of the matrix we can get that thing off your dad's back Vale I think that would open up a whole world the possibilities yeah Polly Jupiter Jones speaks out for a moment as far as I can see there are four terrible awful no-good monsters living in that castle that horrible massive wriggling eyes and heads down in the basement that horrible massive cancerous flesh and tentacles up in the throne room that horrible gigantic Minotaur in the courtyard and that horrible mechanical monstrosity that is that dragon why don't we just assemble our best and destroy them and then we can plan out the next steps he's not wrong Jupiter thank you Jupiter who would who would you want to take on well you know I would you know I would take on all four of them at the same time but of course I would recognize that I'd be putting my allies a significant personal risk in the process of doing that and I would want to make sure that they were signing up to the threat that they thought commensurate with their skills and abilities by Jupiter let me rephrase the question which one would LEM want to take on do you think LEM would be destroyed instantly by any of them he's a feeble man how about your bodyguard how about your bodyguard I'm just trying to say you know what do we know I'll check how much aqua exposure can we make we can furnish enough aqua virgo to get anyone in at it for a significant group to get in and out we have the resources now that we can make sure that you're protected in this way guys I kind of like this idea operation kill all the monsters kill all the monsters the for the core and the core for mmm abrasion anti pork chop yeah no more running no hired of running more running I start a chant I do no more running simply put it's also entirely possible says Eldrick have you tried to control the dragon that's that's a theory that I there was five of them coming towards us at the time so no it's possible you we could use that as a resource is there any way that if combined with our powers combined can we gain a better chance of controlling that's possible we could also you could also try to control the executioner there's no other resources at our disposal that we could use we're not bombing something that could hurt my dad I know we just bombed the Minotaur we do it from the air I'll check what's what's if we bomb the courtyard what are we what are we looking at what's your I was just deploying the weaponry only as a last resort it's a big bomb it will render the castle very inhospitable more so than it is already yeah but the that does remain as a possibility we could simply destroy the castle we're scum to use the weapons disposal and destroy it utterly and completely all right guys we're putting that as plan like D okay I think it's at least a Plan C okay fine Plan C um for all trick no D for destruction deconstruction what about this idea behind these different demons that I've taken over so we met orcses brother we know I'm his sister too right and a sister and we know that Orcas is in the city so many demons what do you know about demons well the presence of multiple demonic creatures lends credence to Sebastian's earlier theory that the Delirium might be a conduit or a beacon or at the very least a catalyst that allows creatures from other planes to cross over into our world hey guys you think it is of course well you must understand that beyond our world our worlds upon worlds the great some of the greatest Archmage's throughout our organization sebastian have made attempts to catalog and describe and bring order to these worlds models like the great wheel or the confluence of the spheres all trying to explain this universe working in a clockwork order classifications meaningless dichotomies like demons and Devils aberrations and more fiends of all kinds these are only things that we have used in our studies to try to bring order and understanding to what many feel is a fundamentally chaotic and incomprehensible resin cascade upon worlds upon worlds upon worlds any sort of gateway or passage well think of it like this our world is like a home it is our home and there are walls and windows and doors and we keep those walls and windows and doors shut for good reason and if you leave them open something may fly in at what point does it matter whether it was a rodent bird or an intruder the window is open there's a window that's like like jammed open in the castle and we need to shut it maybe that's maybe that's what your dad's saying I know he's speaking in broken lines but maybe no King isn't the for the safety of George but they're needing up he doesn't want a king anymore there shouldn't be any king maybe he's telling us that this all needs to end that's definitely what he's saying well that's what I gathered but how will others believe it if Saul speaks up my son you know as well as I know that this world needs kinks it needs order it needs rulers it needs good government dad you're embarrassing me in front of my friends you're going on one of your rants again now whether or not we have a king sitting on a throne wearing a crown of Drakon hein frankly to me is irrelevant we have a legitimate heir to this kingdom in George and as far as I'm concerned we will defend and protect that claim this city and its seals yes represent the power of the throne they certainly do but we have everything we need to prove our claim already yeah I mean you as far as I'm concerned the claim whether you rule over the city that's politics I'm more concerned with the fact that my tender father is in the castle suffering and is telling us that putting a physical person on that throne with that crown is going to render more detriment you are telling me that your personal worries about the states of your father which I grant you I understand that you swore an oath to the crown and your oath to my grandson mean something it does and I think putting him in danger so you can have political rule over this dying city I'm not in suggesting that with respect Lord Commander I am merely pointing out that this notion of no Kings that your father is speaking of is a silly notion and I won't buy into it perhaps he thinks that there should not be a king on on the throne in that castle and fine let's blow it up we'll build a new castle a better one Caspian Castle I'm fine with that I actually I'm willing to possibly agree with that that may be our best bet is that we go in there on a mission not to reclaim the castle but to save vales dad and then we just try to get rid of every monstrosity in that castle whether that means blowing it all up or otherwise the problem is the one other thing that we need to consider that throne was going to give us control over the constructs of the city to deal with the rattling right that's our other problem so if we blow up the whole castle and every monstrosity inside how do we deal with the rat links this is true or caught if we're going to deal with the rattling x' and at that we have the silver order marching on us in almost Eldrick laughs it almost makes me wish we had of thrown in with them yep well it's a little late for that and I mean I'll check they would have burned all of our research and everything to the ground it's true maybe we need to figure out while we're going in there to deal with super eyes he you need to find out more about closing this window this doorway because we don't even know if blowing it up is the same as closing it that's true they could burst something wide open bigger than because it for that reason I would be very careful about disrupting any of the Delirium in that area you caused it to rupture what is now just a crack could form into a true gateway here's here's what I'm putting together we're gonna go and try to save those dad we need to obtain the throne temporarily to rid the city of the rats we need to close that gateway from whatever other worlds are letting these creatures in and if we can hold off the creatures long enough to rid the city of the rats then I say that we just get the hell out of that castle and blow it out if we can close the Gateway kill the monster that lives on the throne save theirs dad and control a dragon I think we've I think we're doing pretty good indeed indeed so step one is we need to save vales dad and we can't do that with a floor of lava so Eldrick do you have any how can we make lava not so lava can we fly I mean it's not lava it's delirium delirium soup well we do have potions of flying that we could provide you with that could be helpful the only problem is to say this creature has an ability to strip magic away so it looks at us we drop so maybe wait greater visibility potions do you have any we haven't disability potions but not greater ones do you have any like are you working on anything to turn delirium or what about Lucretia Matthias does she have do you have any can you turn delirium solid is there any way to like change the state of delirium you did the gold thing she she she did that it wasn't us Lucretia is not here where is she she said she'd show up when she's needed okay somehow great magic we have another one of those I will come to you we need you now can you hear us allow you to find some way to give purchase or or way to to deal with that creature I mean can you surprise it destroy it as quickly as you possibly can before it turns its magic against you turn all your power against it I'm hoping that it can't see through my darkness in which case we may we may have a harder time hitting it but it's easier to aim at a ball of darkness floating around and an intrical darkness yeah we could also remember do the the triangle if we separate it up and surround it it can only aim at one of us at a time with its with its main eye mm-hmm now if it does catch me you guys realize how I'm like but if it's pointing you it's eating it from me and rail okay and vice versa turn around well it yeah we're all gonna be dealing with its Turney eyes but it's main eye is the one that is anti magic can we blind it that's a great idea that's why I'm gonna try to darkness it can you yeah yeah this throw stuff in its eyes what a noise your eye everything right hmm so let's just throw stuff at it sigh okay like anything anything in your pockets just throws well there was there's plenty of pillars to hide around maybe we have to play that game you like to play the veo game I would love a if you have an employer flying and this thing can strip magic from you you'll just need to find some way to protect yourself if the magic thought fails you if there are things to climb against however horrific they sound you know I don't want to touch it but I'll touch it for life if it means not falling in delirium goon myself and River will provide you with whatever resources we can and we will arrange to get resources brought from the Academy here for the morning but you need to tell me what you need well I think we should take those potions of fly mm-hmm agreed can we all have we have one a movable rod what are the chances that we can get two more or even one more they have one we have one that we can that we will give you because I think that's that's a great if if it catches us we click the rod rods magic though oh um it falls in thing I just hope that it worked by like no that makes no that makes sense it's turned to my Rangers I say how many climbing kits do we have got lots boss I'll trick do you have any scrolls of or potions of climbing or anything we do but again they're magical magic Oh y'all gonna have to use your and you'll have to mix the two potions we also have my grapple later I'm tying myself to you what are this creature in the throne room Oh you said there was a we're not there yet you'll on the ground what if we break it what if I what if I use magic yeah yeah this creature please unless you can study whatever is in that room attempting to destroy it without knowing its nature could be a great risk this is why I'm hoping Theo's dad can tell us more information but do you want alright are you asking me to physically get in there and put on the goggles and pull out my research kid and I'm simply saying that if it is simply put if it is creating an opening to another world it stands to reason that that opening could go both ways wait one if if we go through the opening we might be able to find its source on the other side and close it perhaps are we going through a portal guys I think we're going through a portal to where guess we'll find out I'm need to talk to my family I'd like that do you want save my father first if that's possible do you want us to to go to the castle and the three of us do that is that our next mission looking around the the agreement is from the room Sall speaks up from what I can conclude destroying those two creatures is of paramount importance to whatever plan we can come forth with once they are destroyed we can confer properly with both the Stuart and assess what is going on in the throne room I'm is that not correct Eldrick and to that Eldrick nonce adding if we can just destroy these will at least be able to have the right decision in front of us well counsel we've come a long way it's just a few months ago you were calling us mercenaries now I guess you're putting the fate of this entire kingdom in our hands I hope we come back and I hope we're able to [Music] remind you guys who we were fighting for all along very well I will contact the Academy and may get the remaining preparations in place I suggest you all rest and make your plans with each other Jupiter Jones speaks up now myself for myself if you need another sword other hand is now the time or any of us come with you we could help you now or do you want us to come in with you later I was gonna say if we can och och works Peugeot the Caspian xand the hooded lanterns they might be able to make a push for the front gate against that giant Minotaur they'd have to deal with a mechanical dragon as well I think they're just gonna die yeah I say we like suicide to me yes unless we have a means of getting everyone into the castle safely a frontal attack against creatures like that death I say we hold off and we we go why doesn't what I mean Jupiter could come with us like we could boy sir there's another clunk clunk listen they're more clunk clunks going in opposite directions means less focus but we need him to be a live one when we do this filled air III grab Vale at polar side and there was a huge explosion better if he dies he's just filling he's filling a spot I know what he's filling a spot for a badge guys what badge does he have no no no what badge does he hi hey hey hey here's a warhead here's a fighter above all else hey he okay he's asking he was leaving the council coconut forget about it I walk up to the council and I'm just like so you just hear about all the things that I've eaten since I've been living in we we he's asking us if that now is the time do you think we need his help to attack this monstrosity or do we wait and use him do you think we can have a salmon I be old I don't think it hurts to have a fourth guy I mean can you carry a fourth you know regal I can't put salt on fish people not bad you've distracted the council the council's like these asides are highly irregular but they're entertaining Pluto can we do it it's you three of us this a classic dragonforce it's always been and you do not want to know what knowles tastes like it's gonna be until the end you and me and Vail and probable unveil for veil her veil and each other and us and veil and us together always blessed veil + veil without the council meeting can concludes and nothing beats the food of the Academy Hamas alia heroes feast it's a grim conclusion and the remainder of them disperse some of them check in with you for a moment but with that everyone goes their separate ways for the evening Oh can I ask Eldrick and River for some help in preparation can they grant me blindness deafness and misty step yep back in my ring yep oh yeah I want to put stuff oh I think I'm gonna put my own spells of my ring yeah and if you ever want to put spells in my ring you just let me know they can have it ready for you well I'm gonna like stock up on two fifth level spells so that I just have extra fifth level spells anything else you'd like to have in your um plus I have absorb elements go get silence okay again just to make sure yeah before you all set out prepare to set out the next morning is there anyone else you'd like to meet with her or chat it check in with I'd like to see my family okay so we're having a long rest yeah I go to see the cook and I say if I don't come back you feed everyone to the best of your ability you've done so well so far thank you for your service it's a standing order to feed everyone excessively where's my family at your father is helping out at the camp blacksmith that's been set up he's running it I am I kind of stand in the doorway to the smithing room is it where is it a hot tub yeah it's it's it's completely outdoors with just a canvas strung over it I I go to like I like walk up and he hasn't noticed me and I like go to like try to look cool and lean against something and then I knock a bunch of stuff over and I start picking it back up and I like stand up straight no son dad things have gotten pretty grim haven't they boy so you've heard they I mean we've moved around so many times now they say it's not safe for us back home in Everwood it's not safe in the city with all the rats I really hope and you've been out doing such madness dad I I'm I never wanted any of this I never I never asked for this but I was born with these these powers and all I've ever wanted to do was was something good and dad I messed up a lot I messed up real bad I think a lot of this is my fault and I've been trying again and again to tell myself that it's not that that I've I've been doing good work here in Drakon Heim that I came back to this city because the city needed me part of me thinks that maybe everything would have been way calmer here you could have forgotten about me you could have had the family that you always wanted and then I came back in your life and now here we are so if there's one thing I can do let's go back to that castle one last time and try to end this and and dad I don't I don't know if I'm coming back [Music] but whatever it takes I I just I just want you to know that um I tried my best to be somebody that you would be proud of you are I'm disappointed that you didn't get to have a normal life but I'm proud that you've been able to live a great one all the parent wants for their child is for them to grow up grow old and be happy and maybe you won't have those things maybe I won't see you have those things but you weren't born for those things I don't think they would have been enough for you and instead you've made your mark on the world in a different way these people they tape they speak about you they speak about the great things terrible things - that you've done but great things that I'm proud of you you live the life that I don't think I could ever understand but I love you boy and I want you to come home I'll try my best he gives you a big hug I hug him back it's a long hug yeah I'll tell tell the rest of the family he turns around and he gives you he says I've never been one for magic but I heard the tales of that creature and he gives you an iron spike just like stick in the wall it's funny I don't use tools like this very often but although me this and he gives you a hammer [Music] well it'll be just like when I was in it and you were oh there's a rope uh-huh so many tools this is a climbing kit you know when I was a little kid and you were trying to teach me how to blacksmith and I just kept setting everything on fire I remember you told me damn it Sebastian you'll never be good with these tools and now here we are you're still giving me tools and hoping that all I'll make do with them so um if I don't come back I just want you to know that it's it's enough to know that you're proud of me and I want you to know that even though we didn't talk much for a long time you're a really good dad thank you thank you my why I'm glad you've come home and I really hope I know you have to do what you have to do but I'm proud to have been your father and I think that I've made a lot of things in my life but without a doubt you wanted to find this things I've made hopefully I'll see you again and I flipped my coat and my scarf billows in the wind as I walk away like and as you start playing with my scarf I like grab you and I pull you in and I just start hugging you really tight and like sobbing and I'm like yeah it's it's a scene and I push you away slowly like and I pull as you walk away and return to your tense a voice calls out in the night that was a very touching displaying oh sorry it's not me same trick as before so no funny business okay anyone who's there it's one of the hooded lanterns I leave my alone did you go in the castle yep did you see it the thing yep what happened did you see my brother what excuse us you see what happened to my brother which one was your brother was he sitting on the throne no was he in the basement he's prowling through the castle he's well he's something else I'll tell you that see the Minotaur Oh was he a crab person cuz I'm really sorry I think there's a Minotaur not the big one outside there's another in the halls wearing black armor and carrying a flaming sword okay no this is wearing my brother's ring I think that's him I think that's Leonard that unfortunate that's my sister's husband the rightful heir to the throne of Castle Drakken he got a die oh I say he's a Minotaur I kill minotaurs turned into a bigot or he could probably be turned back oh oh were you just gonna play that game suddenly now no we're not I've been in there for good you were in the castle yeah we didn't see him did you know about my father I didn't go down into the vaults I was listening in on your little chat I thought we were war oh you were you you just walked in and I get it I just strolled in all this morning it's nothing if she's standing beside us I think during my story I made eye contact with oh my god plural well did you know he was in the castle though sorry say that again did you know he was in the castle look let her know my father I had a feeling I felt a presence when I was around you know you probably could have just like told me that he was there and I would have tried to hey lost your advantage just admitted did we know this that she was right we know she went into the castle yeah and that she left because it was too tough for her yeah Sebastian I want to make a deal I'm listening the first thing that I want is I want Mouse back and we have one shot [Music] you know what Eldrick was talking about with that rift yeah I'm going through we can tune it we can go to where mouse's and get her [Music] what about destroying the thing on the throne will have to but in order to can we control that rift but the only way to do it will need the power I'll need to sit on the throne if you want to do that I'll sit on the throne you go through the rift get mouse and we're even I'll get mouse back but once I'm back you and mouse leave and give up the throne to George if that's where you want most in the world is your sister back I will go and I will get her and I know you won't close that rift on me because you want her back as bad as I do but in doing so you have no claim to track and I'm you may rejoin the amethyst Academy as my apprentice if you like that was was worth a shot I thought I'd try you know all that talk all that all that magic it's all through maybe it's true what Eldrick say maybe no one can ever sit on that throne but that doesn't mean that no one will rule can't we have a ruler chosen I'm telling you that I will get your sister back but we go through with our plan for the ruler of Dragon huh all right all right and then we're even sure Sebastian I know you want to get Maus back but that's this is this is getting too clouded with personal stakes where we need to we need to stop this doorway not try to control it he's only saying to that that to you because his personal stake isn't at risk you would be willing to give it all up I'm not giving it all up on a chance to save someone that you lost as much as he cares for the two of you if putting his nephew on the throne means that he has to kill your father and give up Mouse he'll do it I don't think so well you know you've been disappointed in people before what's one more disappointment Pluto will always do the right thing yeah you're hearing that she's not willing that her father has been sacrificing so much but she's not willing to sacrifice him if it means restoring the throne can we huddle she's getting in her heads Pluto I sentenced an innocent girl not not to death but to an eternity of torment and pain and suffering you did and how can you not make amends for that cat I'm talking to Pluto gal let me tell you but all the things of easy for 15 years all I'm saying is that it looks like the three of you all have a little bit of a personal stake in this of course we do and as far as it the way I see it I don't think all three of you can get what you want out of this so I'll let you sit on that one does she leave after that bear tackler oh I can't tackle one of my people guys let's go to our time we need to talk with that yeah even the even though Lance was like Lord Commander Oh what am I doing here I think I was supposed to be on Patrol food coma you go about your business it's good it actually happened so often that your people are pretty stiff I'm you go off and find your post and bring me a snack can we go into the tent let's have a little 15-minute chat yes oh yes I have I have a question are we in the tent now all right we walk into the tent as well I sip it or is it a zippers or the guy I don't think hi retire close we take it closed do we have a lot of money right now this is how it started but can we just leave this place the three of us we abandon everything we can just go start a new life I just keep forgetting to give it to the lieutenant guys as we have some serious choices to make here save my father save Mouse mmm clothes by George enthroned okay wait why say be your father more important than me saving Mouse who's been holding up this whole city from destruction that we Sam I have caused come technically my plan was first so I get dibs on George going on the throne Pluto Pluto yeah Pluto Jackson alone I need you to look me in the eyes right now okay this isn't a decision that I can make lightly and you have to understand that I do it's just that this is like hope and a folly she's tricked you your whole life why would you just suddenly believe that she can bring mouse back through a doorway through a castle that has been infected by delirium for the past 15 years because Pluto she cares about she cares about Mouse as much as I do but she doesn't care about Mouse more than she cares about taking the throne from you and you literally giving it to her yeah a throne that we aren't even going to be using a throne that we are going to be blowing up or something physical throne it's a physical he's just going to take the throne you're gonna walk through a doorway into who what knows with you two that's what I'd say that I was going on a random an errand mission to find through the council and we had our little aside and we put our hands on each other's shoulders and we said each other for each other until the end always for each other remember that do you remember I don't remember that you're gonna just leave me blindly into like the darkness of an unknown portal that the queen of thieves has to open because only she knows where Moses yeah this you're so blinded by this need to rewrite the past is the past you have become so much more than this one stain on your record but every day I have to live with the fact that she is still down there somewhere just I don't know being ripped apart by demons you killed so many more people you've killed a whole courtyard full of paladins and you sleep totally fine with that I'm not saying it's a bad thing to try to atone for your but what I'm saying is is letting this lady that's been toying us with us since day one and you're just full Huck through a portal and you're gonna drag us with you you're gonna have four lost souls instead of one yeah remember I wouldn't even give my soul up to orcas I'm not giving it up for free to find men look it's okay that we have this discussion just understand that I'm not coming from a place of dismissing that need to save Mouse if there's a chance that we can save Mouse I'm for it but giving her the throne is just not on it on the cards and I think that comes without the the idea that it's just about George I think overall regardless of George giving her the throne is not a smart thing just to get one person back I have an idea I'm listening marry if we can find the location of mouse through other means then once this is all done I mean we have to close that portal but or do you I I want to try to save Mouse if this is your personal stake then I will do everything I can but you also have to understand that I'm not just willing to sacrifice everything to put George on this throne I'm gonna have to make a choice to where it's gonna mean like my father expects now this this kingdom of Drac and I'm and I don't think I can deliver because I saw that thing through your words and it sounds scary it sounds so scary and demons keep talking to me if there's anything that my father taught me is that demons need to die and he might I think he's clouded in this idea that we just need to that George is gonna go and sit on the throne everything's gonna be fine I also think that with mouse I mean you are a school boy and you opened up a portal to Hell why do you need this particular portal to open up to hell and get her back lots of ways to get the hell this is you want to go on a honeymoon to hell I'd be willing to go with you okay okay we we clear all this up one last hurrah and then and then we we when it's all said and done we go to hell then we get most backs and it's just easier to make like a deal with a demon or something I will will weigh out our options afterwards okay saving Bao's father I working real hard this whole time lots of overtime then he needs to get repaid for I have something I really want to say to you guys Vail yes I trust you and I've always trusted you more than anybody else in this entire world you've been my best friend since I was a little kid you've been one of my only friends and sometimes I kind of shove you aside like you're a little sister but I would follow you anywhere and I want you to know that and I love you thanks passion you're like my little mayor you older than me I'm older than you you're like my little brother thanks Pam you are my family and I know that I have my eyes and mind directed toward saving my father but I know that we will protect each other while we're in there we'll make sure we get out of this alive I know Pluto when I met you you were knee-deep in rats and most of your team had just died and I know you don't talk about that a lot I'm gonna talk about that a lot I'm sure some of them were your friends they were all my friends I I grew up not really having many friends and before I met you I just kind of had veo and I mean you've met my other friends cat and river and I mean yeah good really mean friends yeah I make interesting choices but the the thing is you you kind of picked me like you you you just started saying yes to my crazy missions and yeah let's go on these wild river missions that she's sending us on and time and time again you fell into pits of rats you got stomped by monsters you got beaten up and you still always stayed by my side and I just got to tell you that nobody's nobody's ever believed in me the way that you do and so again it's it's us it's the three of us so you guys are the most important people in the world to me and I made a lot of mistakes but if we don't think that getting Mouse back is something that we can do right now and you guys are saying that we can do this that we can focus on this after we close this gate then yeah how do you mean to hell and that
