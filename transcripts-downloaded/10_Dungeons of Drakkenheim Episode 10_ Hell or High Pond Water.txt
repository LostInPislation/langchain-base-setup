Drakken i'm is no more struck by a funny story the city bathed in Elders fire a med wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon hybrid caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome to Dragon hime this is our weekly Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition game with the dungeon dudes that's me Monty Martin the dungeon master and I'm Kelly mcLaughlin and I'm playing the half elf shadow sorcerer Sebastian Crowe and we're joined today by my good friends Jill deny displaying veo sonya the tabac sea gloom stalker ranger and joe O'Gorman playing pluto jackson the human battle master when last we left our heroes veo pollute oh and sebastian had made their way out of the city of Drakon hime once again cutting a deal with the hooded lanterns the remnants of the former city watch for access through the Shepherd's gate our heroes now find themselves in the position where they can easily get into the inner city of Drakken hime the most dangerous part of the ruined city which is still thick and covered in the haze a magical pollution which prevents them from taking long rests while they're in the ruins with sole exception of their safe haven of the clock tower where they are high above the haze and they can breathe clean air as they made their way out of the city our heroes encountered Pluto Jackson's rival Lord Jupiter Jones as they trailed their good friend the rat Prince Jupiter Jones and the had in his sights the idea to kill the rattling x' and the rat prince who had found themselves covered under a wagon and attacked by trolls a challenge ensued and Jupiter Jones was taken down by his troll and polluter Jackson slew his troll the awesomeness of this situation meant that you have now kind of won a little bit of favor with Jupiter Jones's men pretty cool if I said if you do say so myself afterwards you managed to make your way back to the old Ackerman mill where our adventure began to rendezvous with River your contact in the amethyst Academy who hired you all to begin with unfortunally River was not happy with the results of your mission to secure information from Oscar urine after some discussion over what to do next because the research she was expecting you to have real research and you produce nothing but what Oscar urine told you because of this you were able to talk your way through the situation you still got paid a little bit on the condition that you will head back into the city to find one of the eldritch Lilly's and bring it to Oscar urine in the hopes that he can synthesize some sort of potion or inoculation against the haze your mission now is to collect the eldritch Lilly get Oscar urine to create one of these potions and then test the efficacy of the potion potentially even testing the dangerous effects of the haze how you're going to accomplish that part it still remains to be seen but for now seems our heroes are resolved to head back into the ruins to Queen's Park Gardens the only location where these eldritch lilies are said to grow what will you do next as we prepare for the most dangerous D&D mission ever picking flowers wither Jackson is on his highest guard well guys this one should be a walk in the park well I don't know the state of the park is maybe not as safe as it won't once was he was a park ever safe it was kind of it's pretty safe then opals used to go walking through it I don't trust novels okay does it have good lighting I mean it's it's never really light here in Drakon hi many more I remember being a pretty nice park don't remember the elders lilies did they always grow there I mean I personally never saw them I know of lilies but I don't know yeah we're looking for like lilies do we know what we're looking for like lilies yeah I know if like flowers but like I think they're like yeah really really on our way there and it's just like do we do we know what the flower looks like Pluto you know what in ltaly is I've I've met lots of lilies in my life I had a lovely gardener I had a little II cook I had a I had a lily are we are we talking about the same thing are we not trying to frighten an elderly like like an old Lily like like a person named Lily who's old yeah that they oh do you know what an elderly yes I mean an elderly I've seen flowers before and I assume that these are gonna be flowers that my son should be they attack us because they're why is that weird lilies in this weird place I just assumed that they'd probably be magical looking and we'd probably know them to look at them but I let's bank on that yeah don't lose need light I'm sure this ones are magical why else would he want them yeah they won't necessarily need light we'll see they feed on haze we should have this is why River was so mad we didn't do a good job at gathering information he was just like go find eldritch or leaves and we were like alright so we won't Dale's report we're doing a seed report and we for like grade three and we just failed because we didn't bring any see as you discuss on your way back into Dragon hime you've rested for the evening after at the mill again and if we pull up our map what is the route that you want to take I'm guessing you're probably gonna go back through the Shepherd's gate with it through the hood your contact with the hood and lanterns yeah that's our safest way in and then we can we can move along the the main road kind of like past five and nine there that's where the hooded lanterns bear yes yeah and then if we just move along that Main Street until we have to turn right on that other Main Street and then I see kind of like a little side street that kind of goes right to Queens Park garden that's a little bit bigger than some of the other alleyways I can even take you down a couple alleyways that might be bit safe for them yeah what am i doing planning the route I just take your map and I'm like yeah if we take these major lines here it will lead us right there familiarizing yourself with you know your your home town well I mean I lived outside of this city I only came here on occasion when I was brought here by my father for like events yeah I think that would be the safest way as long as we don't like go too far near the market gate then I think we should be okay okay so you'll be heading through Shepards way and then taking your route through the streets between the Market Street and then directly into Queens Park garden from the West yes ok ok let's close our map up and we will venture for it it is a misty rainy morning as you depart into drak and I what a surprise what a surprise the the rain is light it's rather overcast and as you head through Sheppard's way along the well-traveled routes now that you've is established between yourselves to get along kind of the outskirts of the city through the through this through the sprawl into where Shepherds gate is it's wet it's dank but you make the journey pretty good time having done it yesterday and as you arrive at Shepherds gate the familiar horns of the hooded Lantern sound as your approach and a few of the hooded lanterns they lower the gates and open the door safe you're back already a more business in the city our work never ends they asked to see the form that the commander gave you the letter of marque Oh No uh-huh frantically search around no I have it I have it here it is ok they look it over and say go on through try not to get killed you as well that's such a nice thing to say I don't know people say anything that had these crossing points the as always the hooded lanterns barracks are well defended the flag still hanging overhead and the great gate opens up they allow you to head through and as always as you walk through Shepherds gate you can see the arrows and crossbow bolts of the hooded Lantern's manning the gatehouse itself trained on you ready for this slightest provocation the hooded lanterns never let one they always as you go through Shepards gate they always open the first gate keep the second one closed close it then open it a clear sign of their paranoia because they never know if they've raised both the gates that could be the moment of an attack if you have a trust here so much for the commander's yeah this form means absolutely nothing I mean at least they let us pass oh yes instead of shooting us what's that the alternative we just knew maybe if we did this enough times they'll do like the whole like would just they just go hey Bob yes if we flash that if we continually bring them like treasure and like the heads of our enemies which apparently they want maybe they'll start to be like oh hey guys welcome back but maybe it's an Ernie we have a rattling head don't we yeah oh yeah hey guys at the gate we have one flat rattling head you said that we could exchange this for gold the gate guards sighs and says well done they collect the head and a short while later they produce a couple gold coins in a purse good job I suppose or was it three gold I think the agreed bounty for rattling was five gold pieces oh cool you take it this time I'll get it you sure you don't want to split these no it's okay I'll take it and with that you had along the Shepherd's way into the heart of the city as you cross through the streets along Shepards way you come to the intersection where Shepherds Way and Market Street intersect you were looming at the base of the campus district a dragon Haim and looming high overhead in front of you is the great tower of the amethyst Academy that stood in dragon Hein it is an imposing site a thin needle like tower that rises 360 feet into the air and at the topmost point of it rising to a complete point but then there's a large broad disk of a balcony floating out over the sides of course as you trace your eyes up from the city itself to the top of the tower you can see very clearly that the middle section of the tower has been completely blown away and there is a noticeable gap perhaps about 20 to 25 to 30 feet wide between the lower section and the upper section of the tower of the mage guild yet defining defying gravity the upper part of the tower still floats in the air bobbing a few inches at a time I have to ask just because I'm a visual that I'm getting are there like little bits of debris in rock and also just thinner than you're loading I'm almost like it's orbiting around the tower and as you look you can actually see that there is a small rope ladder that has been strung from the middle section to the upper section it's gonna say if we ever go up there we don't necessarily need to rope ladder got my picture my grandma shot that is breech itself is about to two-fifths the way out the tower weather where the breach is and it has a very clear direction to the kind of extra rock kind of soared off and hit in the distance as it and struck right through the towers kind of the appearance of the the tear in the tower judging by the trajectory of it hitting the tower where would it look like that piece of rock landed a little bit to the north of the tower but within the city gates so still in the city still in the city that could be interesting and as you come into the campus district the haze is very thick here it's not the mist of the rain you're coming into an area of the deep haze oh is this okay guys should we be walking it's getting hard to see is it like like a thick fog but like purplish or is it just like heavy air it is a thick fog the haze itself obscure sight in Drakon I'm on a good day you can only see a couple hundred feet down the street but as you come into the campus district with its old stone buildings and slate shingle roof rooftops these brownstones style apartment buildings and houses all lining the streets several libraries academies various buildings of education the mist is very thick at obscures vision so that you could only see maybe about 30 to 50 feet ahead of you and as you start breathing in the haze it almost feels like as you get closer and closer feels like it's starting to burn a little bit in your lungs don't like that feeling everybody be extra careful I can't see very well in this I think to be safe to you guys might want to like wrap at least a piece of cloth around you know your face I'm a little bit resistant but you know might be a little bit more detrimental to you I pull a handkerchief out and wrap it around my face like a bandit well okay well okay do you want me to burn oh yeah I'll do that too okay as you continue to walk through the streets of the campus district towards the Queen's Park garden breathing in and out through the cloud start to see Bale you can see little flakes of delirium are collecting on the on the face masks that I put up as they're breathing breathing it in and the face masks start to help a little bit but as you keep breathing in starting to feel a little bit nauseous two of you he's both of me give me a Constitution saving 400 you can do one with advantage was 91913 13 I don't feel so good guys Vale you're starting to feel a little bit sick as well Pluto you're you're okay Sebastian you think you're going to throw up and you begin like upchucking in your face what are you gonna do take the handkerchief off so that I don't puke into my own handkerchief and am I going to be sick one more Constitution saving throw 26 you take the face masks off breathe in the air and it burns the insides of your lungs as you breathe it in and you start to convulse as you breathe it back in but you don't throw up is this better no it's far worse it's far worse you are now poisoned and will be until you leave the haze you'll need to take at least a short rest or be treated in some way does he know he's poison he does he he's feeling second he's starting to turn pale oh I put the handkerchief back on how far away from you are we from my tower from the clock tower yeah you have to cross all the way across town they get there now do you are you gonna be okay of course I'm fine okay I'll be fine you just don't look fine you almost threw up in your handkerchief and I remember you telling us how you didn't want to throw up in your handkerchief yeah that was a joke I was I don't know guys um I kind of it pale but let us not forget worse and we can always get out of here but if we can keep venturing on yeah don't worry me I love delirium by the way okay um are you okay breathing this ain't I know you can touch delirium but like I can touch glass doesn't mean I should breathe it in you know are you are you doing okay you want a handkerchief yeah okay so I went around my face just in case I'm like I shouldn't take too many chances with delirium I've been a bit you know liberal with it so far yeah I'm fine to everybody you are now deep you are now deep in the campus district are you going to proceed through the shortcut or are you going to change your route I think hey guys I'm fine but it's hard to see and I think that maybe if we move out of the thick haze and that might be nice we can take a roundabout way to get us a little bit through a lesser haze okay not that I need to but for Pluto yeah just in case and for me I don't like the haze just like eating my handkerchief so you divert the group Vic to a heading that skirts closer along the north end of the Market Square passing away from the thickness of the haze around the base of the mage tower the air starts to clean up a little bit you can I'll give you one more Constitution saving throw van once again with advantage nineteen fifteen ten okay so in the Poisson condition is at with this time you're able to breathe it off now that you've had clean air take it takes about an hour to navigate your way but you found your way to Queens Park you're not quite in the same place that you intended to come in from the West you know coming in from this from the from the South approaching from the South instead taking a little bit of a longer route but as a result you've avoided the thickness of the haze in the campus district sorry guys I'll keep that in mind next time we come in this direction yeah I guess you probably wandered through there a lot easier than most people do I go pretty quick yeah it hurt my lung is a bit I mean it wasn't great it wasn't the best situation I've been in maybe I'll start to mark sorry maybe I sorta mark off the areas on the map where it's a bit of a thicker haze so that way I can know that avoid them for y'all's lungs later thank you yeah okay you are now at the south end of Queens Park garden as the areas of the cat this kind of area of the city that you've moved through is a wealthier part of the city it's a wealthier residential area between the campus district in the Market District along the edge of the park this was some prime real estate in its day and the homes built a lot along the edges of the Queen's Park garden are not so much buildings but estates many of them have high stone walls with wrought iron spikes along the tops of them large manor houses with fine balconies overlooking the vistas of Queens Park Queens Park itself is a large divergence from the terrain of Drakon hime because it is a forested Park and the leaves and greenery of Queen's Park as you first look upon them are a sickly deep green almost like the leaves are in a perpetual state of autumn just in that moment before they start changing color high pigment mm-hmm many of the trees you can see through them just just looking at the trees you can see that they are shot through with this peeling bark that is peeling off in strange patterns almost twisting up the edges of the trees revealing the wooden flesh of the trees underneath the bark which is discolored and taken on this purpley green hue beneath several of the trees you can see that there look like it might be bits of delirium growing out of them and little bits of the haze hang through the garden the whole of Queens Park well it's not fenced in on any on an area the main thoroughfares leading into it are of a beautiful stone masonry that form these wide boulevards that are covered with overgrown hedges topiary figures statues and majestic columns there are the arc beneath each entranceway is a grand triumphal arch which is marked with statues of winged and women angels riding upon chariots in a tribute to the wonderful Queens of the city throughout the ages of Dragon hymen these majestic columns mark the entrance of Queens Park you know when I was a kid I used to come here only once in a while but I always used to look up at these houses in this beautiful garden and wonder what kind of people lived in this area of the city and how wonderful their lives must be my life was pretty wonderful that's true yeah this is this is really comfortable yeah Oh up until the point where you know until the city got destroyed yeah it is wonderful I also remember being like a place of wonder and now it's kind of terrifying looking around here the forest doesn't quite look as welcoming as it used to it's definitely got a sinister feel to it now it wasn't it used to almost have like the beauty of the Queens like instilled into it now it's been twisted changed gluto this is your first time in dragonhide yeah um used to look nicer than this eh I swear look you guys are trying to sell me a lot on the Eustis huh I guess there's not really any going back let's just use your visit that tour guide don't you the tour book yeah buck I'm looking at sake this is nothing baby imagine you're selling one of those scenes in like movies where like you're holding up the tour book and it has the picture of Queens Park and then you lower it and see the real oh yeah it looks like decrepit and over ground it is very much overgrown you can see in this part approaching from the north the bushes that were here used to be topiary figures that had been shaped into the shapes of great beasts and monsters and wondrous creatures like unicorns but now they're just the giant overgrown bushes there are still many beautiful statues that can be seen and the archways themselves well they are stained with the markings of the haze and dirt and grime bits and pieces of them have been marked off there's still a quiet dignity to their former majesty if we're going in there I'm gonna tell you one thing I learned in magic school and that's never ever trust a statue didn't you get kicked out of magic yeah there was an incident involving me blowing up a bunch of statues that were just normal statues that's not why I got kicked out but it may just I wanted to remind you didn't graduate like I just want to make sure we all know you did never said I did I just said I learned something magic school hum I was don't trust a statue I also didn't say that it was always correct just that anyways a questionnaire knowledge from magic school that's how would you like to how would you like to proceed into the garden would you like to take one of the main pathways one of the side paths or blaze your own Trail I mean you're the you're the guide here but I feel like taking a road looks less scary than cutting through the trees and bushes it definitely is but it also makes this an easy target so I would say like maybe not a main path but a side path yeah but I mean we can handle anything coulda killed two trolls I've killed at least one troll is there a place where the haze is likely wait one troll know like the haze in the garden is not as thick as it was in the campus district it's receded back to the way that it usually is in most parts of the city so is there like any pockets of it that we can avoid or is it pretty like bits of it or thin your site right now you can see we're not for the forests and the trees that obscure your vision deep deeper within the haze seems to cling to the forested areas most thickly whereas there are some open lawns that seem like the the haze might be following into the lower hills and dipping away you may have said this but were there any light sources in there or is it pretty dark there were along the boulevards and the pathways there were one there were and still are many lanterns and lamp posts but none of them are lit any eerie glows from the edge of the guard the edge of the garden looking in none that you can see so it's just like darkness as you go in there's a flash of the sometimes in the haze there is a flash of purple or earring light in the distance it does kind of play tricks on your mind from time to time but you've traversed the city enough that those flashes of light you recognize them for the just the glow of the mist and the haze itself is there like a prominent large lantern or like a large something that I could like Firebolt tonight illuminate there are wrought iron lanterns that stand about 20 feet tall evenly placed along romaine Boulevard that are have broken glass in them that you could probably hit them in if there's any pitcher tar still left in them they might light up I aim for one maybe like two or three away I have I have a drift globe as well after after I fire my fireballs I'm like no yeah yeah but you do your thing I'm not gonna light every single torch yeah well we can see him I mean I know dark it was it's mainly for him I was I wasn't scared do you want some you just want a light stuff on fire okay I get it I get it well we can be as stealthy as possible because like you said I don't trust the statue well I already lit that torch over there soft blue light comes from the drift globe and it starts to follow just a little bit in front of me okay and which way you're gonna head in yeah if we could do a side path rather than the main road at least still a path but we're not like through the the wooded areas off the the southernmost entrance there is a wooded and trellis there's a pathway that weaves through a wooded area with a trellis overhead you ever seen those forests where it's very clear that the branches have been deliberately grown into an arch overhead yes all right guys let's go in maybe we should just like receive workers sneakily do you want to go ahead do you want to pass to the trees I mean do you think it'd help it if it I don't know what's in this garden all right I'm gonna cast past though trace thank you just in case we're gonna just be a little bit sneaky hey-oh you lead the way and just in trace you want just pass you want the back or the middle I'll take the mill okay [Music] you proceed along the trellis and paths with the trees branching overhead this effect of the branch is kind of combining over top of each other into an archway would have been well-maintained in its day but now the trees have surprisingly grown there's a thick layer of leaves along the ground that and you can hear them tread as you trudge through they softly move oh you are passing with to a trace so that leaves don't eat don't leave tracks as you pass along the trellis you can see out of the forest you can see in certain areas the force opens up into sitting areas where several stone mentions have been laid to the side there are so a few small streams that have been artificially created some ponds within countless bridges a few stone terraces and once in a while you pass by an elegant gazebo or a broken-down one the pathways go off in a multitude of ways are you heading towards the center of the garden or with it what is your heading we look let's look for assignment says elder it's Lily collection well one thing I know about the garden is that like there are different areas based on the different Queens so I'm wondering if we should be going to check out those areas to see was there ever a queen Lily mm-hmm that would that would be convenient no what did Oscar say find me Aldrich lilies I drank delirium my eyes are purple and you killed my lackeys and you killed one of my lackeys that's okay so the only queen I know that's like I mean there was Queen Lenore which is the last queen but that's not really Lily what do we know about elders lilies we know that they are kind of like a production from the haze right yeah there they didn't exist in the city until the meteor hit so maybe as much as we want to avoid the haze maybe the places where it is the most are where they are if we make our way to the middle because all the all the roads kind of converge into the middle right yes they do yeah so if we go towards the middle from there we can look down each road and try to yeah see if we see anything that looks like it might be elder just off the path are there anything any vegetation any like other than the trees and the vines and there are vines clinging to everything almost like leeches how and as you start moving deeper in the the thing that strikes you before seeing any other wildlife is that the haze here is carrying something that sounds like a potent pollen on the on the air it's a it's a very different smell than the musky smell of rotting vegetation or the smell of dirt and flowers it smells like a it is a flower like pollen smell it's quite heavy in the air as you get closer and closer to the center it kind of tingles your nostrils and irritates the eyes a little bit the garden itself though is very quiet and veil you haven't even seen the corpse of a bird or a rodent or a small animal it's a it's very conspicuously there's no noises of wildlife in this cart so strange this place used to be filled with wildlife nothing nothing like no monsters like even like weird squirrel monsters or bird monsters Delirium squirrels yeah you'd think you'd see at least one Delirium squirrel the only thing is well animals weren't the only thing that was alive in this garden Oh Oh what do you mean well plants are alive oh I was gonna say people okay yeah that's I'm on board okay what happens if delirium infuses a plant Sebastian you were looking ahead as pollutant and they were talking and you see a woman look over her shoulder and run into the woods uh guys yeah there's somebody was it was I like a hundred percent sure I saw it or was it like kind of hazy and she came out from behind one of the trees saw you you make eye contact with her and she turn she turned around right get back behind that tree you didn't quite catch a look at her face it looked like her hair was very scraggly little over her head she was kind of hunched over a little bit she looked like she might have been sickly she turned around ran behind that tree the country that you saw there's somebody here and I start actually walking towards what I saw I'm gonna go ahead I start walking ahead I gotta Sebastian's just like curiosity over safety okay I'm gonna I'll follow behind about 15 20 feet pine I call out hello are you okay and I'm just like she might need our help or she might try to kill us but probably the latter why does it always have to be the latter run to catch up with them I'm like release you run for you you run forward to catch up with him you run a little bit into the forest she's vanished without a trace I saw somebody here any any signs like on the ground like footsteps or movement I looked out at the tree that she was hiding near and I started like looking for any signs give me a perception check would you accept investigation yes I will accept he's practically begging 21 there is no sign of footsteps here I don't trust it are you are you still harping on that haze I mean I did Huff in a lot of haze I say we keep going and ignore and just keep an eye out be a little bit more vigilant about which way did she run just behind the same tree yeah to the northwest let's I kind of like to follow back away back on to the path and I'm just like staring around in the forest where she was just confused and don't know if I even trust my own instincts on this so this is the question do we follow it as like some kind of God spirit guide or do we completely ignore it spirit guide or spirit trap spirit traps where my instinct goes personally so the opposite let's go the opposite of the Northwest which is the way we came no no like north what if she can help us what if she's gonna eat us yeah right now it's it's a 50/50 chance mm-hmm I mean like you really want to toss that coin I'm just saying it's as much of a chance that it's somebody who can help us I mean okay maybe it's a little less if she's indifferent and she doesn't want to help us hanging out in an abandoned garden in the middle of the city you think she's gonna be the one to help us no I mean we met fish people and they invited us back to their Kingdom maybe she knows what happened to the squirrels they don't even know at people they were pretty nice as we ate the fish people we have a good track record that'll taste rending creatures and killing monsters and we don't know yet if this is a ofrenda below monster or a monster to kill okay okay all in favor of dings you're following the head lady you gotta slug me with his money with his speech okay so I can keep you silent and protected with my magic what's the worst that can happen [Laughter] we die aJE's I walk off into the woods in the direction I saw her run and I'm like come on guys okay let's go flower pickin after pacing for a couple steps and just being like here we go again I follow the rest of them so what's our order again so now you're in front I'm in the back yeah I'm in the middle I've started going first because I'm I'm pouting now Oh Sebastian alright guys killed grumbling you trudge through the forest following through the mists which as you follow through in the direction they went because there's no sign of any footsteps or footprints the forest breaks it opens up into a larger lawn where there are several artificial pools of brackish water covered in algae and various plants growing out of the microwaves is this like part of a park it looks it is yes it is you can see the Western Boulevard cross you if it seems like you might have crossed through the southwestern section of the park and are now moving into the northwestern section of the park okay and this from our kind of like from my limited sort of understanding of the geography of it this was the kind of that heavy haze part that we kind of avoided right or that was around the campus okay way whether or not there is heavy haze in Queens Park does it feel any different here the haze is no thicker than it was okay okay do I recognize this part of the park yes yep this is the this is the western part of the of the park does have a name the the westernmost part of the park is dedicated it has the statues of the row of Queens sort of the statues of all the the Queens of Drac and I'm and several tiered gardens for each of them oh great I always liked this place yeah I was here when I was very little yeah this is one of my favs and my dad taught me about all the Queen's history here was great yeah Pluto if you want to learn a little history of dragon hime all the Queen's you know I love the tour but before we die from haze or get murdered I do you guys want to go pick flowers do you see any do I there are several gardens to the north in the in the north sorry in the north western section as the row of Queens the forest breaks there are so forested areas but each one kind of separates out into a garden for us are all the different Queens I say we head towards those yeah but which one start somewhere and who's your favorite Queen Oh course the well I see current reigning Queen because she hasn't been found it but Queen Lenore is my favorite let's start there can't hurt we'll work backwards yeah what's the worst that could happen you said that twice now yes there sure you remember veo that in the north west section Leonor had a chrono built for her by by the king which was well known for having many different flowers and gardens around it yeah there's tons of flowers in that grotto that was built by the king we should definitely take a look is that like a greenhouse I don't know what that is a grotto the grottoes are very common there they were quite a fad in this in Queen's Park and grottoes in this case in as they're referred to in Dragon hime many of them are natural but often artificial caves that have sometimes plantlife gardens inside them some of them go underground some of them are above ground but it's a combination of artificial and natural cave light features that are used to build kind of a water garden oh cool yeah let's let's head there I mean we don't really have much of another lead other than the fact that we're looking for a flower Animus know what none of us know what it looks like so I'd say we start with flowers like any flower I mean I know what Lily's look like yeah yeah I've seen lilies before I mean they used to be all around the castle it was like so we just like mutated Lily one of the favorites laughs yeah that's that's kind of the assumption that we're going with so let's start with that okay yeah let's find lilies as you pass towards the boulevard to cross into the northwest there are several pools and ponds as part of the gardens and you can see that you come to asexual section of several archways and there is what looked like they might have been once been artificial ponds that were built here you can kind of have this hazy memory of what they once looked like and is that flash of recollection comes before you these were once lily ponds of water lilies and as you come around through this section you can see that there is sprouting from the water before you a large blossoming purple lily it is really big almost like the this the size of two large hands together floating in the water just coming right up out of the water and as you approach through through the the area coming through like a cops of woods you can see that there is that woman from before and she's trying to pick the lily no oh uh has anybody else seen a lily that looks like that before in their life no do we see the lady yeah you do she's standing in the water lady oh yeah you guys see that right like I'm not I'm not super crazy just a little crazy a little crazy but nope she's more crazy is that how far away are we from her you can all roll a stealth check right now we're passing without trace what Stan oh that's good I mean good that I get the plus 1036 you did it I have a 17 okay I got a 13 okay that's what the [ __ ] guys I roll disadvantage glunk glunk glunk you come to is you're coming out of the forest crossing the boulevard it seems like miraculously Vale pollito has been left undetected miraculously this woman you can see her petticoats are floating up on the on the water she's dressed almost like the torn of clothes of one of the castle staff the the kind of the made like outfit and etiquette and that the petticoats that would have seen her probably possibly even one of the castle of royal handmaidens yeah and she has black scraggly hair that's coming down all over her face and her skin is turning gray and she's very delicately you can see she's starting to uproot the lily do I recognize her you can't see your face I might have a little trick up my sleeve go for it but don't hurt her I cast mage hand and I'm going to try to pick the lily up away from her okay you'll need to get within 30 feet of her and right now you're about 50 feet away I walk coming from this direction we don't need to yeah but and this is the pond over here yeah so I walk up between these two trees and I'm and I like I I very cautiously and quietly walk up and then I cast mage hand and the little hand appears and it kind of just goes and tries to pluck the flower okay of her hands as the hand appears in front of him in front of her she shrieks and quite suddenly you see her hair starts streaking down her body almost like a tangle of vines and as that does so it pulls her flesh away revealing almost like a woody skeleton beneath which petrifies and disintegrates and with a scream she disappears leaving behind the lily I don't grab did you guys fast a hand holding a lily like awkwardly and I'm just like I I've had another incident an incident involving and have you pulled it out yet I feel like the hand like has it just like up there in the water and I'm just like I don't I don't know what to do before you do um I walk up past USA don't move the lily because what I want to try to do is see if there are any like roots around it so that way I'm not just plucking and moving up into the water okay and I'm still like as I'm doing it everyone like every couple seconds I'm just looking up and around just to make sure I'm like that person doesn't come back yeah be careful up there I'm very nervous right now I just want to see maybe if we get this Lily with the roots and we give it to Oscar then he can like grow himself more potentially mmm this will all be easy what's the worst that could happen that's the veil you can hear a clanking noise coming from the pathway up ahead it sounds like someone in loud plate boots maybe even one or two someone's clanking forward was the shriek like loud it was loud uh oh yeah guys uh huh do we hide I think we have to grab that lily and hide I [Music] and I start to run back to the trees okay real finish it come on dice the dice or not uh not working for me tonight it's gonna be a good it's gonna be an exciting one yeah well you know what's the worst that could happen you said three times I'm having fun with it you disintegrated a lady I did I watched Oh Lily yeah yeah yeah what sewed it up where you melted her face oh yeah like what from the castle mm-hmm what we got 29:17 good job guys I I imagine Sebastien is still like you guys are like getting ready for combat and I'm still staring at the place where she disintegrated just in pollute oh where were you in relational this I'm kind of a back where sebastian first spotted her so i'm probably about 50 feet back yeah all right as this begins as you go to rip plant out you can hear a low screaming coming up but it's a rage filled screen of a pair of voices going no trust and it's a pair of voices oh and we can put the other one by the other archway yeah yep that way you can see running along the pathway our two elderly knows both one of whom has a massive bushy beard the other rich just has a glorious handlebar mustache respect both of them are dressed in the clothes of gardeners and you can hear as they're clanking they have backpacks filled with gardening tools on their backs that are clanking in the air but both of them are wearing massive spiked plate mail boots and as they run forwards the two of them holding their hats over their heads they've got these big kind of crimson like hats that they're holding close they take out a gigantic oversized sickle and they start screaming don't touch the plants leave them alone I'm afraid of garden gnomes [Laughter] okay as we go to the top vo what do you do you have the plant in your hands yep I start by using my feline agility and I got freaked out by these shrieks I'm just like oh [ __ ] I touched something I wasn't supposed to and I turn around and I start booking it towards the tree okay and I want to climb up the tree as as much as I can okay so you're gonna climb up the tree with the flower so you basically keep the flower in hand and you scurry all the way up the tree like a cat a scared cat in the tree and yeah that's it I'm just like I'm getting away from these guys because I don't necessarily know that they're bad I want to start shooting at them if they're just protecting the flowers because I have respect for gardeners they're the unsung heroes of the gardening quite a lot okay so next up we have so anything else you'd like to do already my crossbow in my other hand because I have a lily in one and I'll already the crossbow if they start attacking my comrades so next up we have rankle boots the gnome rate right up over there and Ranko boots sees you go up the tree and he takes his that hands out to the side and he screams at the top of his lungs cat and he charges forward towards the tree rushing at top speed and as he gets forward he leaps into the air doing almost like a spinning around house kick - kick the bottom of the tree as hard as he possibly oh what a little fighter and he kicks the bottom of the tree and there's a loud crack as a huge crack appears up the tree like he's kicked this thing with inhuman force and the whole tree shakes and reverberates all the way up and Vale I need you to give me a strength saving throw to stay it's to stand the truth 10 you fall out of the tree and start falling down the branches I got a deal for you if you drop the lily you can try to catch yourself but if you want to keep your hands on the lily you're gonna fall all the way to the bottom all the way to the bottom I want to protect that Lily you fall the way to the bottom dropping 40 feet and you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall and your your back see have a thing that lets them land on their feet - Baxi do not land on their feet it's a good test pretty ungraceful and he lands on the feet and you see his faces face has gone beet red nice big kind of carb cold nose with warts all over it and his eyes themselves are fuming it looks like steam might come up be coming out of his ears and he looks down on you and says no touching as he raises the sickle to bring it down a pot up on you but he's out of actions for his turn pollute oh it's your turn I'm gonna run up behind rankle boots and I'm going to grapple them from behind behind okay crit good okay as you go to grab him he tries to throw back at you violently and it feels like you're wrestling a troll I've done that but this tiny little creature just elbows back at at you and he gets a 23 on his check okay so from my check it was a 24 I got a 20 plus 4 okay I got a 19 oh okay like a kid having and I'm just gonna try to settle him I'm like yeah easy buddy easy easy little little dude what if I call him that's that's not gonna upset him hey we're all on the level and what else can I do can I like try to pin him on your next action yes okay you want to try to pin in okay I'm gonna keep holding them okay next up we have Gorn bin doll the one with the handlebar mustaches and he sees that he's like he points at Sebastian says I saw your magic little hands trying to grab the flowers I'll get you any storms towards you leaping into the air with his roundhouse kick when he uses this move he gets to he gets to move his speed as part of his action as well so he leaps up into the into the air what do I to kick you in the face I need you to make a dexterity saving through not gonna lie you broke a tree but he won't break me yes that's a four so as he he leaps up Springs forward and cakes you in the face and you take 20 points of oh I did not see that coming you did actually I know you running right now you didn't know which way to dodge I'm like - I don't laugh do I go right do i and then all of a sudden there's a boot in my face mm-hmm and with that we go to sebastian i hate i stand up and the and as before this little gnome is just fuming and you can almost see like the muscles and the blood vessels in his face and neck are bulging at the seams as he looks upon you with a rage um i stand up and there's like blood coming out of my nose and something like you you broke my nose you little jerk and then I will web him to the ground okay so on his turn he'll need to make it next sturdy saving throw or be restrained yeah would you like to do anything else with him webs I guess if we haven't determined if he's webbed yet or not or he is webbed but he can break out on his turn so if I back away I think I got the web template over here okay does he make it a he'll make an opportunity to talk about disadvantage right yeah yeah I'll roll the save now what does he need he needs extreme it's a 15 yeah so he is wet I back away as he does heal it he attacks you with the sickle and with disadvantage he gets a 14 can I cast shield as a reaction on your turn yes you can or like even if I've cast another spell this turn yes okay I cast you okay nice the the wild attack unexpectedly breaks away through some of the webs and at the last moment you raise your shield and the brilliant light blocks it and then I like yeah I'm like oh man and like I think bring up the shield just to block him and then I kind of a scary thought the webs are kind of pulling between the trees as well like they've come down from the sides to trap him yeah and then I crack my nose back into place and let out a little Yelp while I do it okay we go to the top of the round with Vail so and I've got the little scamp right still yeah you've got him grabbed yeah so both are he can still fight if I talk it's just a grapple not a restraint okay I am going to get up that's happening and then I cast a zephyr strike okay to start booking it away I was like sorry guys I got the Lilly okay if you are going through the water that will be how yeah well I'll go towards like the gate okay and I take a shot at it will move you a bit closer because you did lose half your speed your turn so you're about halfway yep I take a shot at the guy in the Webb's okay you'll have advantage on the attack and this time I'm pulling out my longbow and using sharpshooter sweet um twenty-four that is a hit try not to destroy them to that where uh and where have you left the Lilly you have it in your hands oh um we'll take an action to put it in my bag yeah okay yeah if you want to if you want to take these shots you have to drop it then I'm gonna place it on the ground okay right Liam place it and then take some shots because well they're strain so I'm not worried about them gravity oh here we go start shooting like are we killing them yeah I'm shooting his legs 23 damage yeah okay you shoot him in the legs and it hits me hook I'll get you a hat and he is bloodied get my second shot I don't know where her morals lie we eat a fish person but where it hasn't in to kill sir and I'm gonna shoot the other one that's in Pluto's arms okay 19 that's a hit 18 damage oh that is rank Oh boots in the legs he is very angry okay they kind of had this coming though they were very angry they didn't even try to like diplomacy us okay we did steal their flowers though I'm kind of in the on the fence here yeah I just need to get in the cell down a little bit which is why I shot them in the legs I don't want them screaming after her next rankle boots as you're grabbing Ranko boots like now let me add her lie behind I gotta I'll kill you turns around and that you're grabbing him he takes it he gets a sickle above his head to bring it down he makes three attacks getting a natural one and an eighth to hit and a fourteen to hit okay I just and it's like a bell ringer like oh if you weren't wearing this helmet your brains would be everywhere right ringing in your ears cheese yeah there's the ringing in your ears no throw them in the web I am absolutely throwing them away okay we will do that as an opposed strength check because you're basically trying to drag them you're gonna have to drag him up that way and then push him in okay we'll do it yeah ten ten I got a nineteen so you tried to push him in and he plants his boots in the ground and the spikes stick him in he's like no oh man would you like to do can I do to move with my actions with my attacks Canada action search oh no you can use each of your attacks as grapples yeah yeah if you want to push him one more time one more time one more time 21 I get a 16 see this and then you push him and he's pushed into the web's I think his feet catch and then he tips over into the wind okay and mystery and then I'm going to run past I'm gonna back up towards Vail okay all righty so now we have Gorman doll who is restrained in the webs and he tries to break his way out getting a natural one and he tries to fight his way out but he cannot to no avail [Laughter] okay Sebastian it's your turn kill kill III get try to try to woo them yeah listen up you little you little you know what hey listen gnome people I'm gonna I'm gonna I don't want to be mean to them I don't want to do either of them seem to be in charge they're both there screaming screaming about how they're going to disembowel you and use your intestinal blood to dye their hat yeah guys I'm making a judgment call here and I cast maybe I just need to talk to them more no I we maybe we spare them and then one of them yells that like I'm like never mind and I fire bolt the webbing one of them in the webbing I fire bolt Gorn Bendel one but I also like the webbing on fire in the process probably having a bad day we did steal his plants I wonder if the hag thing was like a like a like a like a warning sign thing like it was like a nice nice my dice I will double double ones Wow I shoot a fire you shoots a ground rate in front of the webbing that was a warning shot don't mess with us any further or I'll light you on fire a one attack roll can be a high intimidation role yes i intimidate them without it help attacker okay moving right along as as you fire the warning shot beyo give me a perception check 17 these vines in the water the reeds are coalescing right behind you what are you gonna do I want to pick up the lily and start to run away from them okay as you reach down to the water's edge to pick up the lily the woman reaches out through the water yeah and you can see her sunken eyes are glowing purple and you can look into her disheveled face as she reaches for the lily at the same time she as she comes up out of the water it's almost like this wooden skull appears and her flesh kind of grows back onto her skin like bark over tree flesh and her hair comes back in like vines but revealing this almost sunken rotting like face she reaches for the plant sees that you're reaching for it and I'm gonna have you each making a post strength check to grab the plant 10 I get a 16 she snatches the plant out of here grass I'm gonna say this cost your reaction just just in case that's relevant um she snatches it up so that's her right behind you and she holds it close cradling it almost like a child and then she turns around and the end as she does so she begins to run towards the next pool of water moving about 20 feet towards it am i close enough first Sentinel to go off no she's gonna she's coming out of the water on the outside of that do I recognize her face it was really horrific but for a moment she almost looked like she might have been one of the the queen queen Linares maids to another name give me a history check [Music] 13 okay I have it written down here if you could yell at her knee joint stop drop it Lily maybe it's Lily you remember that that her her name was Gertrude she would have been about 17 when you last saw probably keeping like snack system okay moving right along to the top of the rod Baio a teacher to her so I turn around and I yell Gertrude and I start to I essentially want to dash forward and like try to tackle her okay nice did you've called out her name um she seems stunned that she's been caught by it by it by name give me a persuasion check first to see if that if you reach her persuasion yep 14 okay calling out her name as if like she's shaken somehow and you can see like she's got underneath her dress her limbs or spin me like she hasn't eaten properly and as you reach dive in to tackle her to the ground make a grapple check with advantage roll your you're rolling strength a strength check or an athletics check you can apply proficiency 1414 you tackle her to the ground yeah she's still holding the lily as tightly as she can and she she and she starts saying no no no no leave now and leave Leave leave go go go go go next up is rankle boots Ranko boots rages and he says he says I'm going to drink your blood and then vomit it back up and use it to clean my underpants looking at you that's gonna clean them really consider tries to break out of the webbing but fails gluto you're up hold that thought and I'm gonna run over to vayo and Gertrude and try to wrestle the lily out okay make a strength check eleven I also get eleven so let's roll again Oh am i strong seventeen she's grabbing it you basically put your hand on her on her head push her to the ground grab it out of her hands and you had the you now have the lily I hold it up I didn't Sebastian run like what bond and as you take note she reaches for it she continues to try to reach it and says no the lady the lady she needs that she needs them I'm torn but your friends tried to kill me in your weird lake person that has melty face so you kind of lost me you lost me at melty face and I kind of served for going towards the gate okay the rest of my movement um next up is gore mindo rest alone every break his way out but he doesn't come smashing sebastian it's your turn alright guys I'll clean up this mess and I'm going to cast scorching ray dice don't fail me now I'm casting it on is it Gorham bindle whose blood yeah yeah 17 that hits looks cute you're that fireball that you shot that was double one that was with advantage yep that's the saddest advantage ever second one let's relive it just on fire 15 yep that hits oh man 17 I mean all three hit they're not bad but I didn't roll anything higher than a 10 they're cool so the first one that damage okay second one there you go ten how's he looking he's dead in the second shot you can redirect the third one to the other all right and the webs are obviously on fire now yeah there you go there's some damage so Gorn bindle uh the scorching rays what happens so I I pull out my finger guns mm-hmm and I'm like I'll clean up this mask guys and I go laser beams and I hope and shoot him twice and he just like bursts into ash and then the flames start to catch on fire the third shot goes through his head and hits the other one as he's just and then the webs are consumed in flame and begin to burn away at franco boots and then i walk towards my friends but in slow motion with the flames behind look so cool right now yeah I I put the goggles on in slow motion and start walking and there's music in my head and I'm making up right now okay how does it go the next up is [Music] will will actually be Gertrude and Gertrude looks in your eyes and the the glow her eyes stops Ramona and the color begins to set back into her face and she puts her hand on your shoulder and says Vale you need to help me I need that flower I need to bring it back to the lady please please help me get it back make a wisdom saving throw Oh nein okay you're not under her control but she's your friend you should listen to her you should help her out with what she's asking to do it sounds really important you remember her all these memories of her giving you scraps of food in the castle kitchens and slipping you some of the Queen's cakes come back to your memory and you remember the way that she used to being see her for that in this moment it's your turn what are you gonna do I'm going to get off her and help her kind of like oh she's not lying down oh can I say are you talking about the Queen is that the lady you're referring to yeah what are you doing she and she brings her her finger to her lips and says it is very important it's very important we must bring it back for the lady I

take you there who get me back that flower mm no can do but you don't know where the lady is hey give me a wisdom savings row 21 as you as the words no can do come to you you shake out of whatever was beginning to influence you and you see her again for this monstrous creature that she's become I scratch her in the face that's the veil we know so I take let's see fifteen that hits one damage she's reeks again just as before and her her face takes on the dour expression says no give it back the lady will find you she'll know I scratch her again my second attempt okay [Laughter] twenty it hits big damage Oh next up is pollute Oh bear what are you doing you're scratching come on and I'm gonna run over and I'm just gonna start whaling on that actually I'm gonna put the lily down no no I'm holding it and I'm just gonna just they all hurry up we gotta go are you having a reunion yes how big is it Lily it's big right it's it's it's a huge flower and it's really beautiful light and she's pulled it up by the roots the flower itself is almost like holding a very delicate bowl in both your hands and it has all these delicate petals and then the inside the little antenna coming up from the middle almost look like little bits of delirium crystals inside it like I picture I have my shield out but I don't have a weapon yeah and you can hold it in one hand okay okay it's not it's not particularly heavy it's just delicate okay I don't want to break it I mean the gnomes are dead I'm just gonna stand guard and look around and just keep coaxing veio chick leave the weird face melty lady and come with us that's my turn okay Sebastian well I guess we do have rankle boots Ranko boots who burns to death in the web there it is attaboy I kind of want is boots now um okay so I say - I'd like well as well as Pluto I'm just looking at Vail on like what are you doing right now and I'm I'm gonna ask you Pluto do you want me to take the lily off your hands and I think it's my mage hands still floating around yeah I I move it over and to like take the lewin okay and then I'm just gonna let the mage hand float there with the lily just kind of I actually float it up a little bit sometimes out of anybody's reach and I just have it floating there and I'm gonna move towards my friends to kind of survey what's going on with this lady okay all righty with that we will step out of initiative order and we will see how what happens from here she as it comes back to her she stands to her feet and she looks looks back up at you all and says please Oh take it she needs them she needs them we're gonna need a lot more information if you want this Lily back I can I can take you there it's it's at the Queen's grotto are there any more of those guys and I point to the two piles of ash behind me not near no do what were they they were the groundskeepers or they mad at you too no they were protecting us we're just here to gather flag a the lilies we've been taking them when the lady asks us to bring them whenever they bloom she has a great collection of them in her grotto so she has a collection then why does she need more Oh she asks for them she loves them so we need more than why no we might need more than one tell me who this lady is one more time she's just my lady eh I don't and she kind of discombobulates like she's never been asked that question before and she says I I don't remember do you mean us harm she looks at you with this strange look on her face and she twists her head and doesn't answer I feel like that was a simple enough question come on Lady I don't think that this is Gertrude anymore but she's not outright attacking us she really wants the lily maybe we can convince her to show us where the other lilies are I mean we've got this Lily it's floating above us right now we might be able to follow her she says please give it back let me bring it to the lady and as she she looks at you and looks in your face and she implores you said please please bring it back and the color kind of comes back into her face she's doing make a wisdom saving true she doesn't mean us any harm 9 in this moment the horrific parents sebastien it seems to fade away and you can see the young woman as she might have been in your years ago almost like her clothes come back into place her appearance smooths over her features are rather fine and you can in the rasp enos that was in her voice fades away and she says please you need to bring it back for the lady she needs it so much you can help me right you'll help me I need help you failed to save yeah so I'm compelled to do as she asks woohoo my name's Sebastian Crowe and I'm here to help you and I start floating the elder shortly towards her and I grab you and I put my crossbow to your face and I'm like come on so what do we see what do we see it as outside observers how do we how do we see her appearance doesn't change too you know and she was she talking to yes yeah on on Sebastian she as she said that like she was imploring him for help and he was just listening on to her every word you know why attention does my friend grabbing me and pointing gospel in my face do anything yeah what did how do you respond am I still compelled by her I pull out my finger guys okay during their standoff I pull out my javelin and I stab Gertrude stop it evil gag lady I'm just gonna stab her right in the chest okay make an attack run you're turning my friends against us 1919 it hits you like see my fingers start to well you yeah it's like burning 12 damage really okay she scream screeches and as she does so the her flesh and hair begin to pull away again revealing the bark the the tree flesh like skeleton underneath and she recedes back into the into the ground and disappears do I snap out of it you do yes I like and I like fall over and start to like backwards crawl away from you like what what I'm not even good can we all agree to trust each other and not the weird lake person because I thought we were at night I just had a moment I don't remember trusting her but she's not part of Sebastian the three crows or the Jackson theory or video in the Pussycats she's just a weird lake person that came for the ghostly three nautical toss distributing swords is hardly a bit my experience our before is that when people are like that you just kind of got a slap him around so you know I don't it's not a dead shot okay well here's the question there's a lady somewhere in this park that has a whole bunch of eldridge lilies and a stab wound from a javelin well no no oh no yeah she was gonna bring us to the lady do we run with this one Eldridge Oh Lily but like River River said we needed a few sample well let's go look for some more well Oscar needs to make it so if he needs a few samples yeah because we need we need some potions to test if we have to make it back here to get more Lily's after we go to Oscar it's gonna be more time like so we need more Lily's two minutes a go looking for more B wait for her to come back give her the lily and follow her to the follower she said she'll take us to the lady where the eldritch lilies are they don't have to give it to her though first maybe we can work out a deal yeah although nobody look at her eyes I also we might need to gloss over the me stabbing her thing that might come up when she comes back laughter in the face of my claws I'm pretty sure I've got anything I can talk to her wait no that didn't go well last night why don't we go that way it like let's search the immediate area for other Lily's cuz if they're blooming cuz she said they were in the grotto the Queen's garden yeah and she's giving us a little bit of a maybe we can go my other concern is that she might have gone and told either her handler or the Queen the person that she's taking these to yeah the lady that there's trespassers they might be missing two gnomes we we might be under like super surveillance sneak around again you'd be able to see yeah : Casas Oh tres is it still active how long have we been how long dispatched no longer active because Jo since casting off what would you like to where would you like

before the break our heroes of AO pollute oh and Sebastian had ventured into Queens Park garden following the trail of a strange woman in the forests of the garden you encountered her again trying to harvest an eldritch lily yet when you went to pick up one of these lilies you were assaulted by a pair of vicious gnomes who accosted you for trying to pick the flowers and the woman Gertrude who they are recognized as one of the maids from the castle staff tried to charm you all into helping her into helping her bring the lily to a woman that she referred to as the lady but did her guile did not persuade Cluedo who stabbed her causing her to flee I saw right through her and then I put up now you stand in the middle of Queens Park Garden and Eldridge Lily in hand deciding on your next move will you abandon your request here and head back with your one spoiler you're gonna go for even more and try to find more lilies or explore or find out who these people are what are you gonna do next one thing I need to do is I need to take care of my face it's it's taken a very heavy boot to it and it has almost killed me I could use a little nap rest we can use rope trick and then kind of climb up in that interdimensional space and take a rest for an hour I mean wrestling in an interdimensional space sounds top-notch we should how did they learn to do this is just something I picked up along my travels as a boom stalker you know especially since being the shadow this is my specialty needed to be able to get out of situations and recognize just one day you were like I'm gonna climb this rope oh where am i yes what if you learned it from like an old like a magician that used to travel around tracking at me you remember like a cool trick they did or something it was more from observe observing people along the ways like seeing different magics as people came into the city like I didn't necessarily go up to someone and say teach me this but I had to really observe that's why it took me a little bit of a time to to get the hang of it so you produce a rope you cast the spell and you climb the Rope slipping between the shadows of space itself into this little shadowy pocket nowhere where for some reason the floor is she almost solid shadow and you can all climb the rope and take your rest up here before I go up I want to see if I can steal the boots off of one of the gnomes you definitely can and are they like are they can I put them on these these boots are you take the boots off the the dead gnomes and they have tiny little feet underneath oh how they were keeping these these they're charred bodies kind of like the the lower part of their leg kind of breaks off as you pull the boots off but yeah and these boots like an ogre could wear these boots they were so large oh wow can I put them over top of my current boots if you would like to yes I do I find any hindrance with said boots they are very uncomfortable but if you you know had some extra boot straps you might be able to wear them comfort am I gonna spend the hour in the pocket dimension trying to make these boots work okay you managed to um they're they're heavy boots no more louder than they can be louder if you want them to be when you really want to stop around they can really make a lot of noise I really want to try stepping on them I want to I want to try the roundhouse kick okay with the big spike boots nice I I crawl into this little pocket dimension and I look around at how shadowy it is when like I oddly feel like at home here and I just curl up on the floor and like start tending to my face realigning my bones and maybe casting some magic to make myself pretty again cleaning myself up a bit okay so y'all take a short rest in your indice and do your thing I used four of my five hit dice and I'm now back up to full health it really hard you have that kick to the face they went right up to the head yeah I didn't even take anything I didn't use any resources I even I'm down a few spells too that's why I get to spend the whole hour boots yeah normally you're the one that gets beat up polluter but it was these two refreshing yeah and then you guys started fighting each other each other was my bed but it felt it was necessary at the time yes it was like I'd escalate at the end of the hour you climb out of the pocket dimension and the Rope drops to the ground feel refreshed and you have passed it in relative safely safety what will you do now so are we gonna wait for the lady to come back should I put the lily so by the way I guess my agent only lasts a minute right yes yeah so I'm carrying the lily now um should I put it in my bag yeah okay I'll just you want put in your bag I'll like wrap it yeah they're very some cloth yeah place it in my bag taking care of it I mean I try to stay near the back behind blue no next time but are we gonna follow are we gonna try to reason with her and be like we will give you the lily and we will come with you to the lady or are we gonna go try to find the lady on our own lady well yeah cuz we could find the lady find her hoard of lilies and take a bunch we could also just go find other lilies to harvest true those are other options also like based on how things are going I'm now giving it a 70% chance the lady is going to try to kill us and the main lady not the lady yeah like like instead of the 50 50 are now leaning towards it's a 70% chance that everything in this place is evil so I mean if we based on all three of the things we've met here trying to murder huh sit well the lady didn't try to the the yeah the the woman with the face didn't try to murder us she just tried to persuade us to give her the lily okay that's so she's not entirely evil she's just doing her mission okay well yeah let's go try to try to find where these lilies are well and I know where the grotto is correct yes you could if you want to go to Lenore's grotto yeah that's where you could you could leave them there cool do you guys want to do search from where Lily so just go to the grotto you've already been told that she's got a collection there make our job easier if anything like I mean there I now realize the reason that I know lilies is because that was Lenore's like crest symbol was a lily so should have been that we just went there in the beginning but my dad will go there now and get some Louise you tell us this yeah my best like go ahead good I should be a better guy but there BJ yeah you're supposed to be our trusty guy we can talk it out next time if that helps if you want to just you know think out loud yeah so sometimes we're too quick to action and not enough thinking all right let's go ahead okay I'll follow okay I'll take up the rear you proceed across the boulevard of the Queens to the northwestern section of Queens Park garden here are where as is tradition the kings of Drakon Hine have built a grotto in dedication to the Queens and you come through you walk through the pathways until you find the spot where Lenore's grotto was built you recognize it because there is laid out in front of it there is a statue of the royal family of Rock and Hein and in it the the way the statue is built is it's a large pedestal and at the base of the pedestal it kind of built into the pedestal itself is the image of King Erik von Castle the last king of Drakon hime and he's actually not standing on the pedestal he's reaching his hands up almost presenting the statue of Bremen or Ulrich is is wearing it he's a very portly man with a big curly beard and a balding head although the statute clearly flatters him as he looks more it looks more like he's got like a barrel chest rather than the paunch that you remember and he is where the statue is wearing elegant jewelry with rings on every single finger and the beard and bushy eyebrows in the crown of Drakon hime which is just a circle it that he's wearing right now and as he points up the statue at the pedestal the base of the grotto is of the waif like Queen Lenore who has in one hand cradled in her arms their son and holding her hand their daughter and it's it's it this familial like statue is almost like their the king of Dragon hime giving a to his family of thanks as the tradition of these grottoes every single one of the grotto has a stat the other grottoes in Drakon hime has a statue like this where the king was presenting their family almost to the people and years and years ago when this would have been built it would have been a great celebration when this grotto was shared with the people the grotto itself is a tiered garden and it looks like several large pools and gardens all laid out and then a second tier which stairs rise up to but in the center of the grotto you can see looking past the statute because the statues directly in front of it are these double doors that lead into the grotto caves underneath the outside area has the the there's these two tiers with sets of stairs that lead from one tier to the next and there's kind of a cobblestone walkway around each set of pools and gardens which in their heyday would have been filled with water lilies there are many numerous statues of angels and arch on archways looking down upon the garden and in the center above the archway is another grand statue of Queen Lenore holding a lily in her hands but as you look up at the statue that is over the doorway the face of Queen Lenore has been carved away and someone has someone has carved the face off you can actually see that the statue here of Lenore to her face has been carved off blasphemous and there's a few other statues in this garden that are also of lenore and all of them have the face carver and only when when it's Queen Leonora yeah so none of the others like all the other states so many of the other statues here are damaged but not specifically like that everybody else find this unsettling somebody's got a vengeance against the Queen maybe she doesn't have a face anymore and they're just trying to update the statues that's even creepier just I don't know maybe but you think try to be more accurate some sort of faceless monster queen here oh now you put that out in my own oh there it is oh there it is we were about Oh everybody I am just I'm walking by any statue of Lenore and just like putting my hand on it like I'm a bit mournful about it because I remember this place being so beautiful um did you know her I knew her yeah oh cool I was much respect for the royal family they're the ones that would you know lead drak and I'm to be very prosperous and it's time until that terrible day yeah yeah and especially their their children and I went over to it as well there was such a mangy cat as a kid I just always forget that you were from the castle huh I get the you know prince and princess into some trouble sometimes it's probably why they chased me away and let me hang out with them too much but we always had a way to hang em as you come up to one of the statues scrolled underneath it beside this another statue of King Ulrich written over the inscription renting the stone other words forgive me I'll mean like an inscription that was made when the statue was made or like recent more recent this looks like someone carved it with like a chisel into the over the statue do I recognize that writing it's chiseled it's roughly chisels in like someone drew it in like graffiti you guys want to take it I have my Mason's tools no we can tag some of these statues - only to cross it out if that's what you're implying I was like just hangin - but Pluto Jackson was here but we can also do that you watch it so like a new face on some of these statues no leave these statues don't test my abilities one day they'll be restored do we see any lilies well as you come into the lower tier you can see that the this garden has been completely overgrown but the water beds are filled with all manner of exotic plants plants that are not local they have overgrown and value vaguely recall that this this garden had non-local plants in it but many of them are lilies of various different species and many multi horas multicolored pardon me hues there are many of them are white many some of them are a strange lime-green color some of them are blue or even red and pink but noticeably none of them are purple and they're all lilies of a regular size nothing magical looking about them not that you have the ability to discern anything sort of magical aside from the fact that they've become overgrown these are not what our magic friend was looking for Oscar none of them a mmm no one they don't look anything like the elderly we picked does that mean we got to go into the grotto I say we venture forth cautiously but optimistically cautiously optimistically I'm unhappy with what's happened here and I need to find out who smashed all these faces okay so you proceeded up into the garden proper past the pools and regarding the plants towards the doors of the grotto is that what you plan to do is okay okay which way to the to the front doors of the yeah the cave entrance or the the underground tunnels yeah I would say let's take an outside outside route just to make sure Oh as we approach it okay okay for you move along forward and as you do so who's taking you sneaking pointing it I can take point yeah ma'am you go first yes there and I'll stay be in the middle and I did mortar movies right behind you okay okay and I have my jam no back information back information protect me via as you come forward with the rest of the group you can see that in one of the Center Gardens is a very large yellow lily it almost looks sickly and huge and it smells like that it's carrying this pollen on the air as you all set for you kind of catch a whiff of this smell to it and I actually need you to all make a wisdom saving throw 12 three five seven the to veil you catch the smell and pollute oh and Sebastian you can see that they've smelt it and they begin walking towards the flower in the garden end the to eat to view it's like for a moment you see this Lily it's like that must be another Eldridge Lily you've got to get it I have to get that Lily I'll help you no let's go I'll do it we'll do it both together at the same time yeah no take it my crossbow okay try and shoot my boots my boots are strong with that we will roll for initiative AO versus us anything above a ten let's go I want to get that cool there we go cool so I got a 1919 prevail I got a 2222 what's that where did that come from yeah no one might die so it's like I'll give you one but now for this whole battle we'll see what happens I got a seven wasn't great I didn't feel great too busy admiring your big boots and flower right I'm focused I have a focus it's the flower I also I'm going I'm going so high on the initiative because I was too excited to grab this flower blue flower don't worry literally veo guys that's not a knowledge lily just running at it okay they'll you can give me a perception check twenty okay as our little encounter begins you can see in the pool where Sebastian and Pluto are moving towards there are several corpses bloated fungus covered corpses which begin to rise up out of the water they look like they must once have been humans but bits of lilies are growing out of their flesh they and it has given this them this hulking form to go to the top of the round Sebastian you have been compelled forward you may do nothing on your turn save move as close as you can to the lily i am i turn to pluto and I'm like I bet I can get it before you do I shove Vale out of the way and jump into the water and start waiting over towards the lily and I'm singing a little song it's like gonna get the lily okay want to get that rush towards the water you may move yourself as close as you can to the creature yes it is okay so you leap into the water with a splash of water all the algae and the plants coming up coming up around you as you were drawn closer and closer to this this golden shining Lily and I turned to veo and I say don't worry Vale what's the worst that could happen and then I reach out for the lily I yell dad okay now it's your turn I first cast Zephyr strike on my move and use my feel and agility to start moving around I think I have 7,000 feet of room a lot of movement so I want to get as far around the pool as I can and I start taking shots at the lily with my longbow 90 yeah so that's 30 times 2 plus 30 and each square is 5 feet yes so so you can move 18 squares yes I am yeah no that's fine yeah 18 boxes and I take my first shot against the lily that when I just destroy it as fast as I can with my bow and that's a are we shooting that Lily smart 10 the the arrow hits the lily and there is a screeching and a suckling noise that comes from the plant as it begins to move vines coming up around it as whatever this lily has become it is an animate creature so I did it yes you did so my first attack I do 21 damage to it oh yes I take my advantage with my zephyr strike and like that 12 that hits ya nice I also get my D and that is Oh 26 damage oh okay the damage it's time for you to get cut down that's why you're the bodyguard that's right nope okay okay next up is the yellow lily the yellow lily lurches towards Sebastian yes come on closing the gap okay I can touch it and it Rhian as it does so it appears to be knitting itself back together growing back in place and Sebastian I get a 21-2 hit you I just like totally accept that I like going in for a hug with the lily and it hugs you back and as its branch lies on you it lashes out at you psionically and you take 15 points of psychic damage do I love it am I still like wowed by it you can make one saving throw with advantage wisdom I yeah 13 you snap out of it as that rocks your mind you snap out of it and realize this is not a nice creature this is a horrible evil plant monster this isn't an elderly at all polluter though you have not clued in I'm pretty sure it's a lily and I run up to it okay as you do so the does the horrible Drudge behind you swipes you in the back getting a 22 to hit your AC it heads and you're gonna take six points of slashing damage as the thick thorns and it kind of coal that's almost into a blade can I hit it back you are because of the effect of the charm effect you're kind of like just stop it I've yeah you're getting in the way go move to polluters question that said you can make a saving throw to try to snap out of it another wisdom save three you are still compelled by the ODE regularly you do not got advantage because you are a half-elf and you have advantage on your saving truth oh I it wasn't that literally attacked me the lily loves me I love the lily I'm coming to the lily hi Lily wonderful the dredge is the dredges they come out of the water but this one and as it comes to the edge of the water the vines reach up and it pulls itself up to swipe at you now they as they animated as they are by the desperation of their met there their plant that's compelling them they rush forward you can actually see now that smaller yellow lilies are starting to grow out of it and it swipes at you they're getting a critical hit and at 13-13 does not it pulls itself up slashes down with a wicked blow and you take 12 points of slashing damage the first one that's behind pollute Oh slashes at him bringing its Viney arms raking across your back and it gets a 8 and a 23 to hit 23 is a solid hit ok well with that the 23 that's six more points of slashing damage but you can make a saving throw to snap out ok I will try but can i 9 you do not hmm it's not the lily the Lily loves that one spends all its movement I love the lily and this one comes up behind Sebastian getting it 12 and 9 to hit or sorry an 11 and then and an 8 hit I I duck I like go under the water it comes up to try to like hug you in a grab and you duck duck down into the water awesome go to the top of the round with Sebastian um having just snapped out of it just in time to see that thing lunge at me and I like dive into the water come back up look around see everything that's going on and I'm like we need to get out of here and I put my hand on Pluto who's Rita who I see reaching for the lily and I'm like nope and I Thunder step nice so the air kind of pulls South in and there's this moment of like sound kind of stopping and the two of you disappear and then it goes wrong loud thunderous so uh I'm not gonna statue over um as I grab him I go now you see me they all think Khan seems correct the plant fails and both the zombies fail oh all right yeah it's my first time casting a mrs. Sebastian but now I'm further away from the lily so this is frustrating now I have to walk all the way back to the lily I mean you'll thank me later well I I was almost at the lily you nineteen damage kablammo yeah kablammo that should be what I yell that's great it's a good one I actually thought we were I was like I'm so dead I'm just gonna keep getting a hit by dredges until like both the dredges had some wisdom see yeah and the yellow lily are bloodied and where did you appear up here nice veil you're up next alright I cuz of Zephyr strike I don't get opportunity attacks so I'm gonna rush through statues they're showing their age that's all here okay and I'm gonna take a shot at these trudges my first longbow attack hmm 22 that hits 22 damage take a second shot at that same one because I'm hoping essentially shoot its head off okay twelve that hits 20 damage so is it turns to lunge toward you you take it two arrows shooting it in the in the chest and it collapses back into a tangle of vines and it's just nice okay pollute oh you're up you still want to walk towards that plan oh it's still there yes come on Sebastian I'm trying to get to the plant I walk to the plan okay you can make a wisdom saving throw to not throw yourself off the terrace tour it to get towards am I able to like use a reaction to trying to like hold him he's much stronger than you so you're gonna have to make an opposed strength Jack if you do want to use your reaction I mean I might as well try let's let's do it okay first make your wisdom save three okay so he goes to leap over the the terrace it's gonna go up Sebastian tries to grab I try to grab you got a one he elbows you your broken nose and polluter you leap off make a dexterity saving throw watch I just crush this oh yeah 1313 okay so you land fine and continue what my big old boot yeah big old boots jump and continue walking towards get me yeah I can go yeah come here you big old Lilian after you elbow me in the face I'm just like fine you big if you can make one last safe to try to snap out of this these are going so well what dice don't want to do the one that hasn't rolled me yeah that one it's a four just love this flower I really love elders elders lilies especially yellow ones that don't I want this one no it's gonna stop me I'm reclaiming it for caspia okay someone else's turn well I look over with my dice and decide which one gets thrown into it sir we're all happened I mean you're doing okay okay the dredges with this oh no oh no the three dredges all swarm pollute oh now I feel more comfortable and all of them begin reaching out like latching like they're gonna try to drag him towards the plant slashing into into your flesh deeply as they try to you the first one does get a 23 with a hit oh it's others at 15 I get a 15 and then 9 and then 18 and a 14 only the 20 so in six attacks I only hit once yes so even though you're compelled by this thing you just kept my way no I'm so very trying to get to the lily that even them trying to pull me to the lily doesn't help you still take six points of slashing damage as the creatures begin to surround you trying to almost drag you towards slashing at you as they do so do I get one please guide this dice into a 10 or higher I really want that Lily really well i'ma give me that Lily I come hell or high pond water give me that Lily give me a lily Sebastian you tried to pull him away and look what he's done he's gone right back guys I'm just distracting them okay so Sebastian just looks looks out at this scene and it's like damn it Pluto and I'm gonna like run and jump and try to grab Pluto and thunder step again I just like run and like get back here and I okay give me an acrobatics check acrobatics it's a pretty hefty jump you're trying to make there buddy [Music] steam okay you leap forward touch him on the shoulder and once again all the sound just goes next guys I think I catches all no Lily uh two of the dredges make their saves with the Lily and one of the wounded ones doesn't oh yeah baby 1821 okay there is a burst of energy and the two bloody dredges are actually destroyed by this regardless even though the ones made a save and the lily is as well the blast of sonic energy just sending it into dust and smithereens and as the lily itself collapses the last drudge kind of starts to go into shock and collapses to the ground as well I collapse to the ground onto my knees and I scream I grab you and I just slap here roll the roll roll my unarmed strike I got a 21-2 hit you you hit me my damage is zero you think you may be right in the face my arm strike just for damage it just has a line I'm not very strong I do hate you and you're just like oh oh no damage did we find any elegy Louise not a wake up I mean good job not succumbing to that thing I'd like to say it only works on the weak-minded but even I was thrown off for a moment there until it got dangerous but apparently some of us just why go four times the roles that make the choices for you and I really wanted that Lily only works on the weak-minded noted so yeah this has been a nice walk in the park any elder Jahlil ease around I start looking around and our surroundings think we're gonna have to go down I think we have a write up we got to go in okay grotto okay you head down towards the heavy oaken doors of the grotto which hangs slightly ajar there a pair of double doors they open with a relatively loud Creek below you can smell that moist cavern air coming up from below and you can see that that the haze that's in the area kind of floods down in here as you open the doors there are a set of stairs lead downward went into a room which is glowing with green and purple iridescent light you you charming place were headed and the eldritch Olivia had a purple glow to it right yeah almost like a magic with the Delirium but the green maybe that's the [Music] maybe that's like the moths are they mold only one way to find out yeah who's first I look at you I'm going first only to make sure that you know if there's anything we need to look at to make sure you guys don't look at a verse yeah we've had bad luck unless it's a yellow lily because I have a I just I don't know why but I'm like I really want one now you want one yeah no no you head downstairs and the walls here are plastered with gold colored and painted plaster that were probably made in the past 50 like less than 30 years ago really this was constructed you can see so in many places the plaster has flaked away revealing the weathered bricks below it's kind of like a StuCo it's an arched and vaulted ceiling overhead with frescoes painted in the ceiling of saints and angels you come down to a dome like circular chamber and in the center of this chamber is a large fountain the center which is another statue of Queen Lenore again like all the others the face has been carved away almost slashed away like with deep thick rents Lenore is this statue of Lenore is roughly twelve feet tall and she has a an urn of water that is pouring out into the pool that surrounds the statue and then surrounding the pool itself are a large manner of offerings there are piles of glittering golden coins bits of artwork and tapestries statues and silverware some matter of broken blades and bits of armor and shields some of which are tied up within the skeletal remains of those who still cling to those belongings around the pool that Lenore is pouring water into float three eldridge lilies floating in the water the pool itself is covered with is it also has many coins and small gemstones inside and as the light of this room is being cast by the eldritch lilies the purple light is coming from the lilies because they're in darkness and like delirium does in darkness it glows the light of this room comes from three circular globes which are set into the deep four opposite sides of the circle of this room opposite opposite the entranceway there is a large inscription on the wall which is the dedication once again from the from King Ulrich and then on other sides are two gates made of a trellis draw ayran that lead that behind them are short hallways that end in double doors I don't know if I particularly trust going up to these lilies there's something about disturbing the water that makes me uneasy like I feel like there's a stillness here and that any sort of imbalance upsets the stillness well you guys are talking about the lilies I'm actually approaching the the offerings and I'm kind of like looking through the gold and jewels and gems trying to see if there's anything of high value there's several other bits of going through through the offering as you can see bits and pieces scattered amongst them of almost like charred and petrified bits and chunks of person bits that have kind of mixed in and again they things don't rot in dragon time so that this corpse is almost charred to the point of being petrified is very strange but assembled here is there's a lot of stuff here there's dozens of small gemstones there are in fact as you go through it there are small bits of delirium as well about 12 delirium crystals in all some of them are in the water as well and several piles of glittering gold and gems guys we have a lot of delirium here that we can take we should check out those other rooms first okay and then we should plan my thought is being in this weird weird world maybe we can like set up an ambush and kind of like disturb the water when we're ready to disturb the water be like ready to attack something cuz I have a feeling that just like the lady that came out of the water walk Richard I feel like there's some connection with thinking I can also always mage and one of the lilies soon at least yeah the chance to but I think we should check out some of these other doors the first rooms just to make sure that everything's I'm still lying up these gems I'm gonna go towards one of the doors and put my the one near to the west or the east I'm going to do the east to the east as you head down this this hallway you can see that there are thick tracks of mud that going through the gate and then through the doors and the doors are they just like door handle another pair of oaken door with wrought iron and are they closed they are I want to listen against the door is silent now look to these my companions open open it I pick up one of the gems started admiring it this is like Aladdin I know I'm very aware one of the Delirium yeah no just one of the gems Sebastian like so didn't paid and he doesn't he's not a religious person so he doesn't think leaving stuff for people is worth it he's like well this is just free stuff he's not superstitious religious or anything like that it was just like so what he left all this stuff here yeah for you to find yeah I like creating clear are several bits of jade and jet a few pearls and garnets at least a at least half a dozen gemstones probably each worth about 100 gold pieces the one that I've already picked one out yeah you've picked up a piece of of jet that is probably worth about a hundred gold pieces small gemstone pocket that okay okay well I mean if that didn't cause anything oh you're making me big I I did that one a little bit cautiously like I was just like and I like looked up at the Statue wondrously I want to pick up any Delirium pieces that we have not in the fountain okay how long do you want to spend collecting treasure ten minutes I was gonna say five five minutes a solid five minute time line you can all roll a d6 six four two okay a few minutes of picking up the treasure the door to the east begins creaking open you went to the one to the west and I went to the east I thought you said you didn't hear anything you heard that right I heard that now I door opens up then it opens and you see Gertrude it is there and there are two other women with her all of them with the same pallid flesh the opening the door behind them is a room that is also awash with color and light and it you can see a room beyond that is that there look like there are trees more lilies and large mushrooms growing inside and Gertrude and the other two women step forward and they say and Gertrude says you've come did you bring the lily for the lady I finished shoving the hands treasure into my pocket we've come where is this lady you speak of is she in that room behind you they point to the opposite rooms she's in her chamber you may not see her you may leave leave who lay in the pool as an offering to her she will come and collect it when it is her time to do so we lost the LOI they they look very remorseful and they say Oh No the Queen the the the lady she will be so disappointed I mean she has just as many Lily as she had before I don't see why she'd be disappointed did you already tell her that we all the lilies of the park are hers well it still he was everyone that's a little greedy what if somebody else would like some they are not for others they're just for the lady by the way as I'm saying this I like occasionally we'll look up at them but I might trying to keep my gaze away from looking into their eyes okay now that you've know that you've successfully shunned her charms seems like she might be trying to use it against you again but she but you automatically resisted as soon as I really realized that I now stare in the eyes yeah use your goggles guys what what do I say we go in and find this mistress they said that we're not allowed to see her like are they going to attack us [Music] okay we're gonna leave now and then I'm gonna start to walk towards the door how much delirium did I pick up on the ground you picked up at least ten shards yeah cool we can discuss gold later yeah so we all start as you start like moving towards the tower awesome because we don't know them like I I'm I'm just moving towards and we move towards they said where are you going what are you doing I mean we're leaving you're leaving yeah yeah is there a problem are you going to leave the things that your you've taken we didn't take anything making this fgj I say convincingly 25 they say fine then go it's rude not to leave an offering for the lady I take a single gold out of whatever it is that I've taken from the treasure and I flip it back towards the offerings they nod and they depart back for the other room I think it's rude that this lady isn't coming to greet her guests that come to see her well if they're going into the other room we can just like quietly go to the west as long as daily yeah so they go back to the east I do group huddle let's just steal by just up and run there's three lilies there we don't even need to mess with this that's just curious that's grab lilies and run I want to know I need to know what this lady was the one who destroyed the statues as unacceptable still in the huddle I can major hand those lilies we game plan is I think game plan is getting lilies but if you guys really want to meet this lady we get so many more lilies though probably probably there's three here I mean do you think we'll need long run we could have four lilies and no lady great but I it's it's a group huddle fine the lilies will go but if we need more at least we know where it's a smart idea I'm also hey guys I'm like staring at the door to the west I'm like what's behind that door what's behind the door I snapped at my senses Mike no no let's get the lilies and get out of here fine so I cast mage hand and I'm like you guys guys ready let's toss one to me so I well we'll see what happens I'm like okay get ready I'm gonna toss you a lily I'm gonna scoop it out of the water you guys ready to attack anything that moves so I take out my bow and I ready it just in case oh and I'm gonna have bodyguard style a cloth ready to catch the first sheet maybe pull out your sword I'm really nervous I'll just or do you want me to Tolkien I can I can start to bag them okay sure and I scoop the first lily out of the water do my parents dance you pull the lily up out of the water and the western door begins to open I toss it to you monster hunter oh you know what I don't like you okay do you hold the lily or do you drop it we came from lilies I get the hand to toss the lily to Pluto okay the door opens and you hear a raspy voice say are you champions have you come to bring me a flower yes where are my handmaidens nap time Gertrude said she was feeling peckish there is a woman in the door she is clad in a black morning dress with frills of deep green and she has a solid black morning veil covering her face completely the dress is immaculate it looks like the dress alone it is made of this black velvet or silk that almost seems to move its own accord the value of this dress alone could be thousands all you can see is that around her neck coming down to its the dress though the morning dress is a little just a little bit revealing and you can see around her neck is a multi jeweled golden gilded necklace with 11 massive emeralds in it do I know this necklace yeah this was Queen Nora's necklace I just put it in fact you you you recognized because some of the statues we're wearing it that point when I say where did you get that she brings her hand in front of the her face almost like she's gasping when she says it's mine that's not yours I know whose that is who are you I am the lady this is this is my chrono this is my necklace and those are my flowers and as she steps forward you can see behind her though as the door opens further she's almost silhouetted by the purple glow of what must be hundreds of eldritch lilies in the room behind her it is a massive underground kind of greenhouse in the room behind her and there is almost like sunlight is coming into the room creating this underground greenhouse that is filled with just algorithms I call out aura and I say if you're who you say you are what is my name she looks back in trances answer to you at all and then she turns around and says quiet now my turtledoves your mother's talking and she looks back and she says you insult me and you forget your place I don't forget my place the person who belongs to that necklace or the necklace belongs to them would never say that to me how dare you accuse me this is my necklace deep give it back what are the two of you gonna do I as this exchange occurs what did what to Pluto in Sebastian I'm like slowly lifting the second Lily out of the water I'm like looking and I'm like but then behind me it's like hand is just as you do it the woman's gaze which you can barely like just here head tilts and she points at the two of you says hand stops you men champions apprehend this guttersnipe she insults me kill her at once and I'm gonna I'm gonna grab Baio play dead aah I grab Baio and I want to spin you around and push you towards the pool and I have another Lilly will drown you cat's cool make a deception check Sebastian 23 she claps her hands together and she says come now children watch watch what happens at those who defy us yes drown the mangy cat drown it drown it and I'm she's fighting back she's a feisty one and then I push your head underwater are you trying to keep the Lilly safe or you just throwing it in his face and throw the Lilly at Pluto make an attack roll 21 you throw the Eldridge Lily in those face and it breaks apart in his head in his face and there's a puff of of haze and delirium make a constitution saving I got a 10 okay you're you choke you choke moment momentarily and and the the lady sees that the flower which is lies and ruins on the floor Jesus know what are my flowers what have you done oh that horrible cuts we're gonna execute her outside and I grabbed you and I pull you out of the water and she says and she points back at you and says no no no you're fools you're incompetent fools as a bonus action can't harm my plants my flowers I need them wait how many how many does it take I want to use I'm going to use some sorcery points to recover a third-level spell slot I believe requires all of my sorcery points as as this begins to escalate she screams out oh and she reaches for her veil and she pulls it aside revealing a mass of tangled snap vines that end in snapping snake-like mouths her skin is cracked and turning the humble as you can see that there are bits of delirium embedded into her flesh almost looking like scales coming back up her neck they owe a terrible thing has happened to Queen Lenore and that's where we're gonna end for the night the Queen oh my lady okay and over it antsy I'm so sorry I pushed you into the pool I was really trying to sell it I'm like
