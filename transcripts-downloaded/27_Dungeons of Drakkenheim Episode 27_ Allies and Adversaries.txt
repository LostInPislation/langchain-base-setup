south district where the meteor struck bracket hind 15 years ago surviving the horrors of that area as they went to meet with the followers of the falling fire they had now returned and find themselves at both the crossroads of the city of Drakon hein itself and perhaps we boom we explored a lot of the city since since we got here like a month yeah it's the calendar date have I been new is it like morning is it like bright and early the next morning like last night technically I was having a bath you were cuddling a bunch of rats and you were staring longingly out to the city yes as you packed it in for the night they owe you you'll wake him to find that many of the wrappings have departed over the night as nocturnal creatures they have gone all out into the city hunting and you awaken to find many of the rattling is now sleeping in another pile as the morning as the day dawns itself they burrow up and hide away and as you as you wake you're all in the upper loss of the clock tower which I believe you've told the rattling is not to go yeah yeah yep so you have a bit of privacy as as you go but you are awoken by the sound of a banging on the trapdoor below and the sound of the rat prancing oh hello ghosts I have breakfast for you yes yes yes oh god let's open the hatch I guess it's not people right you open the hatch and the rat Prince is kind of clamoring up the ladder with one hand and his tail securing himself to it and he's holding this large satchel that is leaking blood is it beef chicken oh it very very good me he's just like pork yes yes and he dumps the satchel out and it appears to be a bunch of humans No thank you no you like yes yes No very good I think you can you can have where did where did these come from yeah just wondering I'd like to know like the source of my food yes yes very good for you very very tasty yes he says I tried all of little bits sorry some bite marks on that piece where did you get them I start to come towards him a little I promise you that they were not using them anymore were they already dead when I cut the limbs off yes I mean it's not like I haven't done that before I'm gonna be honest thank you they had many shiny things on them to us downstairs for you to do do not like your record I love this I'm so excited to eat it he grabs the foot and shoves it toward you feel yes yes we eat we cook the well we're gonna cook it first what is cook we're going we like our meat warm he's still warm yes hotter wait you said it was dead yes he's yes but like nobody when he when he cut it off so I mean it's still probably a little warmer he's very friend if you kill him oh yeah where did you kill him I find them walking around in the streets in the night yes you see what were they wearing wearing lots of clothes they had some shiny clinky clinky bits you you should let's not kill people who look like these two right but then what we know 'ls know but not better not taste is good it's there why do you not want us kill humans thank you so much for this meal we have a very important ghostly meeting that we have to have we're going to enjoy your food after that meeting and you will be rewarded you not want to talk with me it's for the ghosts only you don't want to hang out with we have to talk to the god the rat God and about that I just hide in corner I need very very quiet yes yes yes if they're not even know I hear if the rat guard catches you in that corner there's even a chance and he'll kill you oh yeah he's not as nice as me okay well you give him some breakfast - yes yes yeah yeah of course hundred percent all the breakfast he deserves it I go down any scurries I can't keep killing people can you uh can you close that hatch and lock it I just call that end we kind of created yeah that's one of the things that I want to discuss actually but we're gonna save that one we're gonna parking lot other parking ones we're gonna wagon a lot that that question horse table it guys yeah well it's a beautiful day in Drakon hime I walk to the window what's it that's it like well you know the it's it actually is a pretty warm day you know in in Drakon hime but it's as usual it's completely overcast with a light rain so the clouds kind of hover out and a low fog has kind of settled in over the city but it would if it was a couple degrees warmer it would almost be human it's a beautiful day in Drakon hime the air is warm the sky is normal and the rain is not corrosive so I'd say let's say we're having a good day here in dragon time but we only have one day until we have to meet with the hooded lanterns and the paladins mm-hmm I think that we have to talk about some stuff yeah I'm talking about how are you guys how are you guys been a while since we've since I've had to do that making a nice conversation sandwich like I make a nice soft opener yeah we'll get into the meat we're gonna get into some pretty I'm pretty sure that's the polite way to start a conversation I am hungry but I don't want to eat that I'm gonna eat you some of my rations oh so blip loop was okay okay his name is the type of meat I'm not a human flesh unless I have to eat it and this I feel like it's not a I need to do kind of moment I'm not starving on the streets I have rations so if dire needs yes we you know cure it and you know try and keep it for later [Music] it's already there but in this moment like way like no way right early in the morning no waste policy yeah never know where the next meals can come from here you can see far out over the city come from a foot human foot looking out at the in the distance where the hooded lanterns have their barracks and just at the edge of the visibility you can also see the the encampment of the silver order and veil it might be building a siege Tower there you can see the activity from here that the silver order appears to be lashing together a massive wheeled wagon as tall as the city walls with a ramp on it and it it's something that you could that only the height of it you could see from this distance it sticks out like a like very obviously but they've built that they're putting together this construction that scaffolds of it are still incomplete it doesn't look like it's been finished but you can see the activity around the encampment of the silver order looks like the silver sit heads are getting prepped for the battle yeah I mean it's gonna be an intense thing to take on a temple gate I guess siege weaponry is actually a benefit in this case which actually does lead me to the first question that I have for you guys hmm we get in the I want to like sit in a circle we're gonna yeah shock everybody pull up some seats make sure that trap door is locked I sit on the trapdoor is rat Prince there I listen I listen to see if I can hear any shuffling okay 21 you can hear some loud snoring snoring yes it sounds like several of the ratleys are sleeping down below in the in the rafters of the various levels the rattling is haven't made their kind of hubble's on the ground level of the tower itself they are using the fact that they can climb very very well to protect themselves but they aren't going past the level where the Ovilus is so up here in your loft there are several levels there and there's a there's a mattress of some sort on the bed correct yeah yeah you've brought in various accoutrements to stay so if you wanted to push some furniture or something over top of the trapdoor while you're having a conversation you certainly could yeah I'm gonna take that whatever I have a blanket the mattress is off the bed I'm like I'm a soundproof that's just a little bit just in case he gets a little bit stinky I don't wanna have to keep a listen and at the top of the clock tower we had like there were like other levels right like you were kind of on a perch even above the trapdoor so we could like go up to that hurt oh yeah yeah we could go up there away from the truck doors well that would be better than me trying to drag myself down yeah so let's let's sit up there so we're all sitting didn't someone say that they're also being spied on by magical means yeah but I don't think there's anything we can really do about that what if we all write down what we're gonna say to each other and hide it behind behind pieces of no that's too elaborate let's just talk about what's talking about for the best let's hope it's a tin foil assassin wizard magic I know magic so I've cast mold earth on this facility and they will not be spying on us all I needed was the placebo thank you I mean just well just wave your hands be like whoo it's over we can no longer be spied on here I've magicked it Wow thanks Sebastian you're the best you're the most powerful sorcerer I know thank you thank you can it be both so we've met five factions yeah but at lanterns silver I've prepared notes okay I write things down it's great I just try to remember things in my noggin and you wrote all these notes in the bath last night yeah well I was in the bath having my wine I wrote down some notes in my little notebook here well I was also reading my mother's spell book that's a really interesting stuff in there actually you understand it I'm starting to understand bits of it I'm trying five factions hooded lanterns silver order amethyst Academy Queen's men and cult of the falling fire or the followers of the following fires they like to be called also the monster people I thought they don't really come into play here engines and monsters we're against them okay unless you want to argue otherwise the first thing I want to discuss actually pros and cons of each faction okay I mean based on what we've learned should we start that lantern footed lanterns they want to restore the city back to the way it was before hello jack and i'm was a pretty cool place back in the day I'm not opposed to getting back to where my childhood Sydney was and they are the remnants of the city guard they stand up for what dragon hime used to be there is that slight relevance of the fact that we're never going to go back to what Jack and I used to be they got to be a business but I also think that a new dragon hime could benefit from a slight element of what old dragon I'm stood for I think their order of like their idea behind ordering that it could be in the city is a valuable asset they're also skilled and established like they are of the city they have a base in the city and they have been now that we're on good terms they've been I don't know really decent with kind of agreeing with us and us working together on equal levels that's helpful is Lee Luke Pluto what do you think they are human that's a big bonus in my books good good good um what else what else what else they yeah I think you guys hit all the notes they they seem to be like they're like the native population if they're people that used to live in Drakon Haim that's some of these other other than need to be in this Academy so it goes what other people can't claim to if the Paladins are from out of town probably fine yeah as a Caspian does it does it affect you that I are you like for Dragon I'm standing for Jack and I'm or do you think I I do have a have a vested interest in Jackman and I think I want to see it prosper in any way right what does I'm here it's cuz you're here yeah it's cuz you guys you guys have given me a drive to make Drakken I'm agree and I think the hood lanterns have with all their shortcomings have it the best of intentions yeah I think when we mentioned shortcomings we now know who the mole is we're gonna have to give that information it was by the way guys good job on that rescue mission with Wagner we left him in the hands of the Queen's men when we went to fight the t-rex he just got taken back to a prison cell and he never talked about it again at least at least we know who the mole is I totally forgot do we it could be anyone short time I forgot about Wagner [Laughter] what are they what are the negatives of the hooded knickers I think if I'm gonna start right off the bat they they are a little reluctant reluctant to change and change is inevitable changing it and yeah they're not on board with I don't think they're fully onboard with new dragon I'm a new dragon hime has like what fraction do you think is the most willingness to work with others cuz none of these factions can just take over like whatever whatever the new track and I'm is it's gonna be a buffet if you will I'm imagining that will need at least two or three factions who can agree to work together in order to take for the start and then they can like life finds a way but at least we know that the lanterns are willing to work with the paladin's even though if they don't necessarily want maybe the same outcome we don't know that yet but they've already shown their willingness to work with the paladins so let's talk about the silver order that pros and cons pros are super powerful yeah they have a lot of resources and firepower so killing monsters get things done I think they can get the work that needs to be done and drachma I've done what they expect after that I'm a bit concerned about that that is the concern is they they've told us many things they've told us that they're not here to take over dragon hime they're not here so like forcefully infiltrate and like they're not gonna try to turn dragon I haven't cast me as kind of what they promised us but I wait there from Illyria yes there there'll earrings today certainly they serve the higher right but they've also been pretty explicit about saying that they'll do what they need to do as long as they think it's right like I think if if we got to a point where the lanterns and the taliban's didn't agree then the paladin's would have more leverage with their firepower to take over like illyrians I'm not all of the Rings but I think there are good people where it becomes a little more challenging is that these this is a very focused group of people like they're they're there religious they have a very set way of thinking so they're not just like it's not just like aliens or Caspian they're like they're devoted to their cause so that can also make them a little difficult to steer in the right direction when we need to yeah that could be a con they're not squishy and Manuka yeah and because they're so devout in their choices even if it even if we have overwhelming evidence to say do one thing if their beliefs or their system or even though they're the higher command decide that they don't care hmm it's so hard to get them to sway whereas some other people I feel like are a little easier to convince when thinking I didn't think the hooded lanterns are easier to convince with evidence they're more sound in that way I've never been one to get along with paladin's and actually when I first heard they were coming I had full intentions of fighting them off but given the circumstances they actually seemed like they could be very helpful in the taking of jocking home I also think they're more manipulative they're they're more easygoing if it comes down to say the Queen telling them that they need to leave versus just commoners like us telling them they need to leave right so I think they respect the hierarchy which is also I think another Pro for the hooded lanterns is that they are protecting the Queen and she is kind of she's not the same as she once was but she still is a ticket that we have to say the Queen of Dragon hime or wants this yeah and so far the Queen of Dragon hime wants us to reclaim dragon her yep and once and find her children and find her children and that's I think what one of the most important missions that we have right now yeah but I think without the Queen if but if something were to happen to her and the hood Leonard's didn't have it then I think that would make it more difficult with the paladin's but so far we've got our cards blown right there so what about the amethyst Academy punch and billet of jerks I mean I've I grew up with them you didn't mention it okay I think they are there they're arrogant jerks and their magic like they can't see us thankfully do your magic but they they just it's it's frustrating that they think they're all high-and-mighty because they can make things and they have a tower that blows what's giving you that impression because they they kind of they're secretive they hired us but then they also dismissed us just as easily like we were just work of people like I mean we are how much we did such great things I thought we were on the same level I feel like they they think that they're above other people and I worry with that kind of leadership in a new Dragon hi-yah but they can cast spells so I mean you know but they were also here before very elitist you know what I'm saying and and for order to be there needs to be a little bit less I think they're very big-headed magic might be very handy magic it's fine not only magic but you know what the image is fine magic in a lot of you have magic well let's talk about pros and cons and we're talking about pros and cons the amethyst Academy knows how to handle delirium mm-hmm knows how to do really cool things with delirium we could rebuild rackin hime as like a city that exports delirium potions yeah that could be our main export export and help our economy like there's an opportunity here that we turn the fall of Drakon hime into a prophet and the amethyst Academy knows what to do with delirium it's a lot of tuna yeah a lot of tuna um my only pro they have a lot of resources that seemingly they're keeping from us which again we don't know whether they want to use it for good or bad but they're big unknown they're a big question mark right now and like I don't know if being a question mark is necessarily working in their favor in order to make the decision of whether we should help them or not what's confusing for me is I mean I I lived with the amethyst Academy four years before the incident not the incident of the meteor but the incident of mouse different kind but even then they were secretive like I had friends and I learned how to use magic and they were really helpful but I never really knew everything that was going on there their secrets have secrets their secrets had secrets have secrets they're kept in little boxes that only certain people have keys to like the bomb that we lost Sebastian you know that only full members of the Academy are admitted into the towers of the amethyst Academy which are found throughout the world they maintain separate schools for aspirants like yourself so I was never in one of the towers I've only ever gone to school under the amethyst Academy exactly which school was he here like the University of Miami in Ohio would have been far off in which cross in the El Sordo all over yeah I was gone for a while I was pretty far away yeah took me a while to get back here it's tradition in the Academy that they don't train aspirants anywhere close to where they grew up well I mean if I was probably a good thing for me they took me out of there what like a week before the meteor hit mm-hmm sorry amethyst Academy big unknown but lots of resources that's what it's come Khan Khan's big unknown I don't think they're really willing to work with a lot of other factions one thing that is interesting is the people that you've met from the amethyst Academy are not the people in charge of the amethyst Academy vision charge I don't know so Kahn that's a con we've talked to my mentor but my mentor works for other people and I do not know who that is very close how we even really met the Academy not really we've met we've met we have Academy just like when we met the following fire we'd met the falling fire but we hadn't actually gotten an idea about who they were until we met Lucretia yes so really they're I would even consider them a faction we haven't really met that's true we need to ask them some questions I think they've been gone for a while they took our mirror we should go to the tower we should go to that tower GOC that's going to probably be an important mission that we might have to do after the battle tomorrow okay more important no we have a battle tomorrow so that's most important yeah well what about the Queen's men guys I very much dislike them so like calm I start with the cons here they manipulate the crap out of us they they broke us and had us bend the knee by force yeah to work with them it's not I've tried to kill us multiple times yeah yeah they've never really done anything to make me want to work with them except out of fear fear and frustration but here's one thing that I will bring up they have a t-rex when we are storming the gates of Castle Drakken do you want to ride a t-rex into battle but is if that if that's what they're going on based on resources right Pro yes they have a t-rex but their information is their resource and that's a big Pro and that's probably the biggest Pro I have right now for any of the factions is that they've given that even a tidbit of information towards where my dad may be what's interesting is the Queen's men don't necessarily have all the information the queen of Thieves does yeah so if we are in agreeance what's your opinion on the Queen's men do you love them hate them do you want to work for them do you not want to they at least we know where they stand like the the there's no secretive it's not enough to work with them well there's there's no secondary plan like that that's the reason why I'm hesitant with the amethyst Academy I might not like the queen of Thieves but she's so transparent with her ideas for how Jack and I'm should be ruled like there's no I don't get surprised by her as much as I do we don't even know who she is but the thing is is that she's technically a question mark too and we kind of owe her our lives a little bit we also a little bit almost died because of her no no no Pluto this is this is not a good point of view to have when somebody threatens to kill you puts you on the brink of death and then says no I'll spare you that's not us owing her our lives it's chain schools around our hands we still would be dead yeah because of her yeah yeah but also because of her so like that's what I'm saying I'm not saying she's great but she's also at least we know where they stand perhaps there's a way that we and we can use that to our advantage I feel like I'd be once I get what I need from her back yeah never I I think that my there might be an opportunity that we could maybe look at where we dismantled the Queen's men and just have the queen of Thieves and with no options left maybe she works like she has nothing else crime is I think always gonna come back and she's a major player in that so we'll run rampant if we can maybe find a way to like deal with her before next the new dragon hime I'm trying to think user until we don't hear any yeah like and just at least we know where she stands that my concern with the amethyst Academy is that they could be gathering some like they're already making weapons of mass destruction like they could blow up Jack and I'm by accident before even the the Queen's men have a chance to ruin it and with their crime so like that's why I feel like I trust the Queen's men more than the amethyst Academy based on exactly what we know okay yeah right here it's no I'm not saying that either of them are good or bad it's just that I find at least I know more about maybe we just need more information to be able to make an educated guess about the Academy so that would be I'd say like a high priority in order to make a decision whether we want to commit them new magic works that way magic works in any way that I think it does lastly cult of the falling fire they they almost had me guys but what a wild guard it was it was because she seemed really nice but their ID at the end of the day like there's the wanna be a hero I want to be I want to be valued I want to I want like to do something good for Jack and I'm I want to be with other people who apparently have had the same visions as me but not by jamming he's a delirium in my chest no two pros and cons like Khan they are as crazy as the Tala dens when it comes to crazier crazier than the paladin's but they don't have the resources like from what we've seen to back it up they do have something though that is really intriguing to me although horrifying they can go in the Delirium everybody who has the rock jammed in their chest seems fine they seem healthy yeah it's freaking me out amethyst Academy thinks about that I'm sure they'd seen it so this is why the Emma this Academy Falls higher on my list of people to trust because we still need the amethyst Academy for information and I think they might be able to tell us more I'm not I'm gonna throw this out there I do not want to work with the cult of the Fallen fire at this current moment they freak me out but I died they do have something that we need and that is an understanding of how to survive in the Delirium haze so it can be useful for some information but only very specific information perhaps whatever is happening to their bodies by jamming a rock into their heart we can mimic in a potion or something like that then maybe doesn't need to be jammed into a chest and make you have bowel movements for days I would appreciate that you know be really scary if Oscar started working with them actually guys come to think about it in order to make Ledo Jackson immune to the haze we had to jam a needle into his heart filled with reaction yeah but maybe that's I don't know maybe there's a correlation there that you need to I don't know anyway I'm not a man of science one thing you brought up was the of it comes back to delirium delirium is a big part of tracking him now yeah you have factions that want to use it and sell it your factions I want to destroy it and infections I want to keep it where it is is is delirium like do we need to get rid of it all so that the city goes back to normal do we try to incorporate it like you said into the bag from what I see delirium causes a lot of problems okay so here's here's a question and we're gonna do we're gonna do a vote okay all those who think a new Drakon hime has delirium as a part of it raise your hand okay I don't see how it's avoidable we ship it all out we could destroy it all the Paladins know how to blow it up that's true I could be part of that could be how you restore it you know is that how you like how is drek and I'm gonna get on its feet after that without relying on other cities to be indebted to them to get them back on their feet I think if the delirium can be used economically that way Jack and I can not only potentially get rid of it and use it but also get some money out of it and reboot to rebuild that's the thing is like you can get rid of it but then you're left with a broken city I will I will bring up a point on the other end if we are going to use delirium we need to find a way to neutralize the haze yeah that's like if I don't know if you guys remember but there's a crater yeah I mean that could be some literally toxic air spread out through the entire city all I'm saying is if we can find a way to neutralize the haze then it becomes a Myna beliefs orse yeah if you can treat it like a resource if if we can I saw oh man am I in the middle of this so we have well it's Thai I just want to be like the way I see a city operating is not with like a foreign meteor substance that turns people into glass oh I agree I think the haze needs to go but I think the delirium itself mine didn't smaller quality quantities can be a valuable resource for the economy not that I think the palace once when I was young it's probably the extent of my knowledge to more qualified than most common veil actually her entire survival has been on the form of trade this is German trading delirium for goods so she knows yeah they have really kept my belly full well not even full but like semi-happy so here's the big question mm-hmm I think that we all need to pick two factions that we think we would work with and two that we think we wouldn't who wants to go first not me me okay great wonderful I shouldn't have let that hang [Laughter] honestly from everything that I've seen so far I still think the hooded lanterns and the paladin's are best resource for reclaiming Drakken hime but I'm not done with the amethyst Academy I don't know which side of the line they fall on but for me they are the middle ground and they could go either way they are a valuable resource they have a lot of knowledge and they might be one of the best people to handle delirium problems in Drakon hide the paladin's and the hooded lanterns I think are an excellent fighting force that could protect dragon hime rebuild the military and they both stand for relatively noble causes although one group of them are from a foreign country we also have the other which is the hooded lanterns to counter that and if anything if the paladin's try to step on this turf and say no this is our turf really that's just gonna start a war between them and the hooded lanterns that we can back out of yeah and say okay whatever guys but I thought we were working together yeah but right now they are working together mm-hmm and I think that shows that the paladin's might be okay with working with dragon I'm not against dragon hime hmm that's my views Queen's men I could see use for them but I do not trust them at all and the cult of the falling fire I kind of don't want to talk to again because they have the potential to manipulate me because they really like to talk to my wants but then they want to jam a rock in my chest and it freaks me out now go glutes um yeah I'd say that I agree with your choices except aim at this Academy who would you put as a maybe then instead of amethyst probably the Queen's men okay because again I think they're the middle to lower class of people they have a lot of support from people that are still surviving in Drakon Heim and maybe her maybe she can be leaned on in certain circumstances to do the right thing and when we say right thing like they're all about survival which has gotten them this far and I'm sure veo you've had your moments when you've done stuff like you people where you've had to compromise and I think we've all had to make compromises my big concern with the amethyst Academy is that they make bombs they still have kept you in the dark and you've known them your whole life and you still don't know key things about them and the fact that they have all this knowledge like the fact that the there's something with the tower that was shut off a hundred years ago that they knew about and they knew about your mom secrets they are a shady Bunch and they don't let anyone in and that makes me more nervous and again like as I put them close to the Queen's men and his economy I put them very close together but at least the Queen's at least number one she she let us live but besides that she at least is honest about what she wants they miss academies just kept us so in the dark that they could be plotting they could be using us they could also be I don't know and that scares me so at least the Queen's men is the enemy I know I hear you and then the cult of the falling fire I'm kind of with you on that it kind of freaked me out I would love to know more but how do they is it like a youth thing is it like a is it like a like an antioxidant cream that is the heart yeah I don't know how that works it's not there's one way to find out that a makeup company that owns that right side and my big my big thing with the Paladins is that if they can blow up the eye I know you guys see the economical value but I also see like the danger that and what we don't know I want to know what happens to people after like two years of having a gem in their chest they can't be good this amount of exposures obviously turn people into monsters so I feel like any part of of delirium being around for a future dragon time for people to just have normal lives it's like I feel like if it's a big mine then yeah but if you want it to be a city again I don't think delirium can play any part in it that's how I feel very good views respect and then who did I miss they miss anyone no no hooded Lantern so Lord or silver order amethyst again colorful that's how their Jackson really compelling arguments and I agree like my gut is telling me that the hooded lanterns have the purest intentions of what the city should be I trust their judgement but if they're going to work with the paladin's that that is the right route I see value and delirium but I think you're right that oh I think when I envision what dragon I'm used to be in wanting to get it back to the same place as my childhood delirium is not part of that like New Jack and I'm maybe but if we're trying to get it as close as we can to what it was before my thing is unless there's something magical that happens a practical that can get rid of the delirium it is no near future that it's really not gonna exist within within that that area but if there was a way that would be a start to getting it back to the way it was I I agree with you on knowing you know the enemy that you know I want to dig deeper and find out what the Academy is about so I can make a proper decision based on whether or not they're keeping things from us for the sake of a proper plan or whether they're just keeping things from us because they're a bit more sinister but if I can know that then at least I can make a clear decision about who might who my true enemy is where do we see the amethyst Academy again I'd like to talk to dr. LJ just me and him it's been a long time but I I just hope that he sees me as somebody who like I he taught me and Here I am trying to do something good hopefully and I hope that I can like talk to him as a person and not have him I can't imagine he would backstab he's he's been kind of like a second father figure he raised me almost more than my dad did you will know until you ask him I know and if he's not willing that that says a lot right I know there's a lot that they need to keep for their own order but if if he's that close and he thinks of you that way then there shouldn't be anything he's willing to hide my other thought as well is not just as in the Academy how much have we talked to other factions about what they know about the Academy what is the Queen potentially the kwid sorry the Queen's men Queen that's the Queen Queen queen of Thieves Queen of these is the queen of trakula yes screaming at Thebes queen of Thieves what does she know about the Academy and what they're up to is I bet you she's holding back talk to the queen of Thieves any time soon not yet but if we happen to come around you never know when she'll pop her random ghost ahead of Wagner and then but I think it's checking and seeing what the next steps are for the hooded lanterns in this battle for the paladins is gonna be I think in our best interest and then yeah I would dig into the amethyst Academy to find out a bit more about them so you're for the hooded lanterns yeah a question mark on amethyst Academy yeah paladin's we there with as far as I'm concerned they're connected to the hooded lanterns in my mind at this point like you can't not work with one and work with the other there and then when it comes to the Queen's men and the following fire volley fire they're just a flying my face right now you know if I need it as like a garnish I'll eat it but um yeah I was in Oh thieves the thieves have information about my dad so I'm gonna use them even like a lemon until I get what I need to and then Boop oh they go so I trust I trust your judgment on that because I don't think they are what's right I think they are all for you know ruling dragon hein with no ruling and I don't think that's I don't think we're gonna let them get into power but I also don't think we can get rid of them know so I think it's more like how can we maybe help aim their intentions yeah yeah you know yeah like I think it would be impossible to get rid of them because I mean a meteor didn't so and they have some wicked skills of information gathering yeah yeah we should I am envious of you should figure out I mean they have a lot of people in a lot of place you can teach sorry I mean obviously Wagner is a perfect example of how they're gaining information which one question this one is for short answers only what do you guys want from new track and hood like what do you imagine horse that's good I like that that's a good solid short answer very concise to the point you would you would like a new horse I want a new horse when all of this is said and done you would like a new horse for your efforts in Dracula is that it drag it one thing I know and if well it's just one of the things then okay what else do you want like what's what's your you know what with this this actually ties it with another question I have which is what's your most important goal of Pluto Jackson instead either well-balanced I don't know my goal to cani cani is it to find that document is that like you're you're basically like if I don't do that I go home a failure so that everything that I've come here for is lost I think that's something that's very important for the three of us to understand is we're a team now and we're gonna be a team so if that document is the most important thing that you need to do before I forget how important it is and sometimes we just walk around dragging home and I keep being like yeah I should really get on getting that document we're like I killed a lot of my men that it's like an impress I think once we do this with the paladins and put it learns that that'll hopefully help you out there hello I've got my two goals if my dad is there then it's great I don't care if it's all monsters and full of delirium like my dad's there he'll have a better idea about what we can do so I trust his judgment it's by my dad and ultimately new dragon time I would like to see food in the belly of every hungry cat my cat I mean any people people okay yes so when it comes to like talking about the thieves getting they want to survive I can I can relate to that right so find your dad and dude for everyone food for everyone yes for me I I mean the reason I came to the city in the first place was to learn about my connection to the meteor but I think more so now I want to learn about my mother because that all seems to be a big part of it so I want to learn about my mother mm-hmm that is my big goal is because I think that learning the truth of what happened to my mother leads to the truth of what happened to me on top of that I just want to kind of make it out of this thing with the three of us peacefully riding into a sunset alive I do want to be alive that's actually probably my number one goal that's I could survive I mean I just I just want to make sure that the people who live nearby like my my dad's new family I want to live forever and I never want to die and all my friends are happy and I know but I want to learn about the meteor and other than that I just want to like I don't I don't want to do this forever why are you already planning your return yes I'm planning my retirement I'm in a city where I get almost killed every day when this is over I'm hoping that I can like I don't know teach some kids how to cast spells or something maybe inner-city kids yeah like the ones inside TRACON hi melted from I'll start my own Wizarding school yeah Sebastian crows school for kids who can't spell cast spells too good I want a few other things good too yes glass armed people nobody needs to be discriminated against just because you're evil Hey no okay no you do some magic I mean they could learn it or they can be not any more missionary discriminated against for being magic Oh no yeah yeah I thought you were saying well come on no no no no come on I thought your sorry I thought you were saying that people should only be chosen for magic if they're only certain people no everyone I don't have everybody who can do magic should be accepted as a magic user and should not be looked at as a horrible member of society I broke down a few buildings it wasn't any way is it videocast magic and she isn't burn down anything maybe it's just you but like I'm saying it's like you're evil on fire all the other magicians that I know don't let anyone it's an emotional trigger I don't other magicians who have set people on fire like by accident no no very much you like I forget and we'll help you it's just that oh you're the only one that lights people on fire and accidentally brings it I'm gay I don't know if you caused the asteroid let me know I control my magic now okay magic doesn't control me I turned you into an ape that was intentional believe it or not me turning into the ape the first time was not but hey i I'm just kind of going with what you said I've one more question we checked the trapdoor again I'd go back down and I checked I listened at the trapdoor 27 it is clear the rattling ZAR not trying to eat problem okay I come back up guys we have one issue that I think we're all afraid to talk about we have to promote the Rat King know um the reference to Rat King I don't think I know I don't I don't think that there's any way any way that the hooded lanterns or the silver order are going to be okay with leaving rattling 'he's alive in the city so the last question that they have for you guys i knew this was gonna come the rat prince has been an amazing guide and we have we had fun just say it say it bone up and say it just say it say what you're singing don't make us think it without you saying it that's not fair to us do we have to kill the rat race at some point do we need to do we need to take out the rat Prince he's killed herded lanterns he's killed paladin's he is killing our allies because he is insane [Music] yes yeah I really Vale actually if we fail and who do we trust the rat Prince raise your hand if you trust the Reverend he's not gonna lie to us but he's gonna keep murdering people I think we just need to use but we keep murdering people - he doesn't understand say don't kill hood at lanterns and he says I don't know don't go kill people that look like us I don't know like he doesn't he won't get it he doesn't have the capacity to understand I tried to give him rules to not go upstairs and it confused the heck out of him got a good question for you what do you think the rat prince has better more of or worse moral values than the thieves yes he kills anything and eats it just want to say they've tried to kill us more times than Hughes tried to kill us yeah because we terrified him into believing that we are talking for his god so I'll agree with you that they cannot continue to kill people under our watch but is it really our duty to murder all the rattling or is that the hood atlanteans charlie maybe we just have to distance ourselves as an ally maybe he just can't stay at our house anymore due to the key how do we tell him that without him trying to kill us we have to break up with the rapper well I just think that um and this is gonna be the hardest thing we've ever done in Dragon besides you know what no no no it's got a good way of doing it we we yes it's safe for them here but we need him to go back to the rat's nest and we need their eyes around the city I think we they can still be valuable and you know what again if the Paladins and the the hooded lanterns end up killing rattling 'he's fine can't have that emotional attachment to them but i think they can still be valuable for the eyes and ears of the city i will take on all of the Queen's men and big Linda but breaking up with the rat prince is harder I'll do it and it's it's harder because really our whole relationship is built on a lie I'll continue to lie to him that's fine no qualms about lying to the rapper what what is hourly that's the most toxic relationship we've ever had was the firt well to be fair most of the relationships that I have developed other than with you two has been based on lives that is literally how I've been doing my job as a wizard not a wizard a sorcerer bounty hunter but that's what you sir well I myself in and out of places Lyme I self into power lie my self everywhere and of course when I arrived in dragon hime I just assumed that I had to keep lying myself in two places including with the rat prince I was one of the first major lies I told mm-hmm and it worked I just kept lying and it kept working I can't wait continue because he is on a murder spree like I said is it our job to rid the city of all the rattling no but then well then we need to but I don't think they can stay at our place I don't think we can be allies boundaries yeah we need boundaries okay so I don't think you know I think you're too emotionally attached yeah you need to sky can separate my emotions and like I'm okay with okay with the agreement we have sometimes he kills people I just don't need to know who they are you know like I have a pet dog now and sometimes it kills people but I love it so much and i think i think the rat prince is kind of like another pet dog to me then are you gonna get rid of your dog - no no here's the difference if i go if i say to the rapids go attack that guy rat parents probably will and then he'll attack like six other people that I didn't tell him to attack and eat them the dog only attacks people no Amy then you need to just like use your fire bolt and every time he does something bad just bleep bad rat prunes gonna train them we haven't done our due diligence as problem we are grappling owners okay we just let him have his way and now he's gone to the bad habits the decision doesn't need to be made right now but I'm just saying be aware beyond our friendship with the rapids our friendship which is based purely on lies and the fact that the Rapids thinks that we are gods or descendants of gods keep in mind his actions and what we can and can't control and what the people who were going to be aligning ourselves with see when they look at the rat Prince and the rat links if we try to present them as a way of navigating the sewers to the hooded lanterns or the silver order I mean we might just not happen maybe we should just never bring that up oh yeah I think they need to be our own thing and we don't need to tell the hooded lanterns all our little secrets but I agree the rats cannot live in here if we're going to give this as a safe haven for the hooded lanterns to use which we did promise maybe we should find a new place for them to live that's nice I mean they have the rat's nest they already had a hole man they got driven out by the parts okay is that true that is correct also okay remember that's why we had to send them there in the first book that may be they can't gather on the same place and they need to make smaller groups of themselves and get bandanas of their own - why don't we send them to Oscar Yorn's old house terrible idea there's a whole house with a basement of like a labyrinth of little tunnels they could probably dig their way to the sewers and they're out of everybody's way and they have a new little hiding spot good compromise and they can just murder and kill anyone that goes near there until we come to an agreement that we might need to help take care of a rat problem so the other option but it's not our benefit right now it's not in our benefit and if the rattling have to die I might try to turn the rat Prince into one of our pets he's one of them we can teach him he's already worn clothes and walked with us down the street sure he was good that day he was really good he didn't kill anybody he walked through an entire town yeah maybe we just had a bad day we've been neglecting him a little bit he's been on his own he needs more of our good influence good that's all the questions that I had okay so yesterday lanterns paladins by proxy more information about the mistress Academy we can use the girls wing use the Queen's men book compare them with the Queen's men and figure out where we sit when the falling fire were just like men okay but are we met to the point where we're going to start fighting if they fight us like more neutral parties yeah I don't if we attack them what if Queens men are found in and around the streets like technically when we've been talking about the Queen's men there's a difference between the Queen men and the queen of Thieves yeah I think the queen of thieves is an excellent resource but I think Queens men getting into our business is a problem that I'm willing to take care of violently yeah but I think also they're not attacking us but I also won't force a Samba if they are hurting people who are also trying to survive in the city so like if they're going against their own value of everybody should have a place everybody should survive like the Queen said then I don't agree with that and I think we need to bust it up but ultimately think about our own survival of course so that means based on this entire meeting by the way thank you guys I wrote these questions down in the bath last night thank you for joining me in this lovely conversation you smell nice thank you uh yeah sorry about your drinking water by the way I mean it rains every day vo you're gonna have more drinking water listen I drink I smell a lot of water it's no way better than I did yesterday okay I have a fresh I even clean my clothes I'm sorry as long as you're sorry about it don't let it happen again bathing I might before we set out I think that means that we are an ingredients that taking on temple gate with the hooded lanterns and the paladins there's a hundred percent in the best interest of the city yep so that's happening tomorrow well the battles aren't happening tomorrow but our meeting is happening tomorrow yeah with the hood and lanterns and the paladins where we discuss our bomb situation I've I've come to terms with the fact that when they asked us about it we just need to admit that we lost like we lost to the queen of Thieves she outdid us doesn't meet the Academy asks us because they're the only ones that know about it yes okay but also we can tell them that we that we like if they ask us about we we went there to gather information and learn what we could we didn't learn a whole lot we got we got owned we learned a lot we did get distracted I mean I learned a lot we learned some things but our overall our mission to the queen of Thieves to find Oscar bring him back alive and dismantle the Queen's men was a failure in all respects I thought we were just gonna make them not involve themselves with the bad that is our partial win I mean we can go to the commander and say they're not gonna bug I still feel like it was a family it was a mixed success are you guys are we eating that no no just can you make it disintegrate and you like Bernie start at the window I'm sure someone will gladly eat it but yeah we need to actually get probably the rats out of here then before anybody comes transom noon city should we like call the wrap heads up yep let's get our story straight special assignment he needs to move all of the rat links to a new location will points safer location it's not safe here anymore a safer location with a lot of room and a lot of underground areas to explore yeah and we were told by the rat gods to do it what if Oscar comes back to his house then he's gonna get eaten by rats actually that's a win-win or he would get rid of the rats and that would also take care of our problem so really sending them to Oscars place benefits us in one of two ways if Oscar returns they're either the rats all died and we don't have to be responsible for killing the reference or Oscar dies and that's that problem taking care yeah good let's call up the rat Prince then all right we we had I head to the door and I open it up Mayo rat Prince yes yes yeah you're going to join us for the last part of our very important VIP meeting any do I get to see rat god yes yes yes they still here you're not going no the record only talks to us but we are his messengers I was so excited and I say no no no no records or aegis if we do so we stay down we don't we don't we don't try to make sneeze we do not that's good that's why you have been invited to this room to talk to us and the rest of nas leader what do we do how we eat all the humans get rid of all the dog men yes yes we do hope to get rid of all the dog men but that yes yes yes but that's not your mission you have one that's much more important it's the most important mission not the cow man I cannot do that they too big no they squish us we'll take care of them we'll take care of the cows so we don't have to ignite Ben or cow men no just men men you even don't need to do that for a little bit we have a more important mission for you more all this must be terrible mission this is going to be very hard not dragon is it no no no no no you got me if I dragon we don't need you for fighting we need you for infiltration and having eyes and ears around the city I have two ears I keep them both they never get cut off no no and most of your rattling zs-- have both eyes and both ears yes yes most of them there's a low some don't that we kill them anything that's fair eat the meek the rather God says you must have two eyes two ears it's very important noted have two eyes and two ears if any of us lose an iron ear we cannot don't hear about those so go ahead go ahead there's a place that not only we need you to get in because it's so important for us to take that area for the rat god but it's actually safer than being in the city we need you to take it just outside the walls outside the city you were you were in the rats nest before which was just outside the walls there are some maybe there's also a lot of underground passages oh and I know that you're capable of attaching those underground passages to the sewer system oh and so what we need from you is that will become your base of operation not tower we have to leave down yes the tower is needed for further work that we're going to be doing but it's so safe here there's so many people passing through that we get to jump on TV there will be people passing through the new location as well but you're gonna have better access to the sewers and you will be safer oh where is it I'm gonna pull out a map and I point to the location it's this house right here I will have to get screeches screeches understand how all these script lines are okay okay bring scratches now we take this yes we show scratches with the your screeches tell us where we go I'm gonna circle I'm even gonna draw lines on how you can get there yeah but if you want to take the sewers and you probably might know a better way but there you go now the most important thing is that you are in charge of this operation and you get that tunnel from that spot into the sewer we go tonight as soon as it dark out we lead all the wrappings I take them all Kiki and scree and mr. whiskers and we all go yes and avoid the people yes yes yes cuz they will hurt you and we don't want that yes if there were one or two alone me no yeah if they have fur on them not like me but fur on them then yes if they have no fur on them avoid them because they'll probably eat you oh yeah this might be okay I'm gonna try to simplify this as much as possible rap Prince you want the monsters that squish you and attack you gone yes yes yes yes we have plans to use other people that look like us to help get rid of those monsters until those monsters are gone you shouldn't eat the ones that look like us because they're actually going to help for a bit what if they already dead can I eat them then yes yeah but don't kill them when will we kill them too when will we kill the masks we'll let you know as soon as the city is safe for you to do so yes we kill all the men in the city is ours exactly potential X sounds so good yes yes yes yeah actually I don't know why he's not a faction well we take out the monsters and then we take the rest of the humans and we let the rat Prince just keep the lie going and we're like the three gods of Dragon I'm with the rat Prince and inspire me know your phone is sounding like bad but all the words you're saying sound good so I just want you to know that my prince can you handle this mission yes yes yes yes yes yes yes if you complete the mission send one rattling or yourself to the tower - wait - this we do this yes to this tower one but don't let him be seen by the people yeah we're gonna giving this tower tour the Granton they don't get the upper floor no that's my bedroom where all my stuff is yeah what done me my food oh they can use the bottom like we said they could all right that's what we said yeah all the way to the top and waits with the pigeons but don't eat the pigeons don't eat the pigeons those pictures also titled us that face don't don't I will thank you and sacrifice or I will eat you if you eat my pigeons they are messengers of the rat God oh the rat God only uses pigeons to send his recipes don't eat me yeah he's don't well not how I want to die I want to die old fat fragments as a reward for taking on this mission we give you the parts of bodies that we didn't need delicious you may take them down to your people with that the rat print scurries away with the remaining limbs and the rattling x' begin to make their preparations to depart or read banner in the evening and yourselves sounds like you'll be packing up and we're to next it I think we're gonna head back to the the hooded lanterns yeah we have we have a meeting with them and there's no time to waste where we're basically out of time I'm also thinking like in terms of afters well the only places we haven't been in the city are like the castle the Academy Tower the Academy Old Town hasn't been there over to the right side of track and I'm inside old town north there are still places in Drakon time that I think we need to take a look at Kings gate and Kings Road in that whole area is a mystery to us yeah yeah first we take I've been really been a market gate either we know that it's full of monsters we don't know what kind of monsters yeah we also haven't been to what is it there's the Cathedral have seen virtue via or working on that yeah yeah but for now I think we need to go forward with the attack on temple gate yeah and so we're gonna pack up our things Pluto maybe we'll have a bath I snuggle with my pigeons a little bit just be like your final preparations complete they'll set out towards the barracks of the city watch and we'll catch up with you after our break one of the ruins again a big thank you to action shield for providing us with the awesome gaming

just failed yeah with that let's return to the ruins you're venturing across Market Square as you depart from is there anything you want to do before you leave the clock tower I must take any of the rations that I have and put them into my bag because who knows what's gonna happen after this battle I have spent every free moment that I had in that clock tower either reading my mum's spell book or the cult of the falling fires religious texts and kind of just going back and forth between them to learn what I can I've also been like kind of reading over your shoulder because I'm I'm I'm more just I had a really fun time when you were teaching me like nee-chan oh oh do you want me to keep teaching you well I didn't get it so yes cuz you like one of these days maybe more magic might come to mean everything how do you do it I like this yeah you got it but it didn't do anything um as you leave the clock tower the rat prince has left the offerings from the corpses which appear to be there is a rather not on bandolier that in it the bandolier itself is ruined but the pouches it contains having it for potions of greater healings and in amongst the other bits of refuse and trash which largely can contain ruined silverware bits of armour and cloth scraps there is a hand that is tightly clutching a coin purse that has a hundred gold pieces well wants to potions well that's the other thing too is that greater healing potions cost what like fifty each they're much more valuable I think we need the potions for the potions but do I have the ointment already so I would say let's I feel like Sebastian you use more than I do I get - you're more squishy you can yeah I like I'll feed one to be the neutral potion fee the game of cross swords hammer and shield she imagined was played that's our magic dual wielding hammer bludgeoning bludgeoning slashing and piercing with that do you setup yeah okay where are we going you're making your way for the hooded Lantern's barracks you have several routes that you have traveled frequently along this way are you going to proceed cautiously normally or with haste I think normally normally we can stroll down the road but we're confident it's a beautiful day in jacket man we're going alrighty as you cross the city it you can all row me at d6 boo boo boo keep singing while you ride three three five the rain picks up in the afternoon as you cross the ruins of the city and the the fog descends leaving visibility quite short but you're able to seize that to your advantage as we cross the city's skirting across the streets and through the alleyways as you make your way across Market Square past the grand guild hall and down shepherd's road towards the hooded lanterns barracks you make good time and after an hour or so of traveling through the city you will arrive at the gates of the headlands and barracks and you can see that it is a flurry of activity the gates are currently open but there are guards posted everywhere and you can see that there is a troop of soldiers of the fall of the silver order that had been posted as well it's at this time that you realize that almost all the hood and lanterns perhaps have been recalled back to the gate and as you go through their courtyards and you were welcomed in by stennes former friend Grogg they let you in and you can see that many of the hooded lanterns are using the various resources of the training yard to practice various maneuvers and Ansem is out in the front with several of the other hooded lanterns and several of them are poring over what looked to be larger versions of the grapple gun that you found earlier there are two handed versions of them and the soldiers are practicing firing them to pull themselves up onto the walls that's genius Wow that's gonna be helpful yeah I still have yours Green gave it back yeah yeah probably carrying more weight than mine yeah that's fair Oh mines really easy it shoots first is the portable version yeah they're they're much larger weapons that require two hands that they're using but the lines that they cast go right up and latch rate on the crenellations of the of the castle of the city walls and then are able to pull up the hood of lanterns or they are able to deploy them almost like the ladders it looks like they don't have many of these that the groups of them are practicing that they have three of these devices that they're using you can also see that circling overhead are several of the silver orders Griffin riders there's a flurry of activity all all about and as you enter into the courtyard you are greeted by some familiar faces including Petra and she approaches you and says you're back fantastic I hope you bring good news we bring news well at least you're not dead there's a lot going on and the Lord Commander and the the night captain I have to say they'd hit it off really well the two of them have been in the war room making plans and I have to say the night captain in the Lord Commander make for a brilliant strategic team I don't think we I've seen two commanders on the same like coordinating troops on the same level like this in an age it's really amazing to see that is it's not really fantastic plans it's a great resource for the city to have you know in this time of need a very quick question there's a soldier that operates here we've met him a few times by the name Wagner oh yeah roll what he's part of the Queen's Guard yeah so has he been privy to a lot of those meetings he's part of my detail that is is watching the Queen so no but he's been in close contact with everybody around here of course why do you do you know him I quickly look around are we like why are we having a private conversation no not at all I asked her if we can step off to the side somewhere well sure you can come in the barracks but we can talk privately certainly more private so yeah we'll go with her into the barracks cool you head into the barracks proper the fort and what the what appear should happen is that the hooded lanterns are splitting their guard details with the silver order so on all the major entrances and exits a hooded Lantern and one of the soldiers of the silver order have been posted a sign of neutrality between the two of them so that no one faction completely controls the ins and outs although noticeably as you had inside the fortress the Royal Guard are the only ones protecting the upper levels of the key and as you come in Petra continues there's a lot to discuss I have to be honest I I don't want to take too much of your time but the the flame keeper as well philia Reid she wants to speak with you the commander and the captain of course want to speak with you Queen wants to see you too there's a lot of people that you need to meet with we are gonna meet with them and I need you to get Wagner and also bring him we need to meet with him as well and sure once again are we like we away from people yeah yeah she she bring she brings you up and and in in into one of the guards and sends out a few of the others what do you need to say so we spent some time you know our mission right to go infiltrate the the queen of Thieves and the Queen's men yeah we found another prisoner while we were down there and it was Wagner that's impossible Wagner's been here exactly I think what was most important as well as he didn't know about the Queen you didn't know about the Queen you didn't know who we were so there's two theories one of them is more troubling than the other I'll start with the less troubling one the less troubling option is that that was a decoy created by the queen of thieves to confuse us the more troubling option is we have been fighting this idea that there's a mole within the hooded lanterns for a while we were unable to rescue Wagner security was a little intense there we kind of forgot I didn't forget we were just in getting anyway we were getting thrown into a pit with a monster and then we were sent free we woke up the next morning anyway we couldn't get yeah we get to the part where but the more troubling option is that the Wagner that is here the queen of thieves can change her shape can change her face just by thinking about it so somehow there are people in her ranks who might be able to do the same there's a chance that the Wagner that is here is the mole and that is how the Queen's men are getting their information about the hooded lanterns this is horribly it is horrifying and I'm trusting you and I don't think that we should act severely I think that we should bring Wagner before us and the Lord Commander and you and you know what kind of magic or sorcery that the queen of thieves uses can you can you undo it is he some sort of shapeshifter or what this this is the trouble is for all of my magical abilities a lot of it comes to me naturally and I I'm not a wizard I did I didn't study this I I mean I did I went to school for it but my schooling was more to understand how magic works for me there's magic out there that I don't know how to interact with and I'm not sure how the queen of Thieves is doing this it could be a shape-shifter I've heard of them before I've heard of of creatures out there that can change their forms I might have an idea yeah we do have some magic that'll make until the truth zone of truth oh sure we get flame keeper oh philia yeah yeah she can can you round these people up and tell them that we have a very important meeting and we'll say it's like a Queen's meeting so we get the Queen's card I mean alternatively you could use that information to your advantage and feed them I don't think that this is really my place to decide I mean then I would say bring them before commander and we should discuss it with him in the room we should have an accusation meeting where we wildly accuse each other things one of them another one of those yeah well what do you think the best way to approach that is I don't want to join English I'm going to quarantine Waggoner send them down into the break put them under personal guard and we'll figure out what's going on do you think he'll try anything I had no idea bring people with you then okay we don't know what he's capable we'll go we could go should we bring this information we should bring this information the commander I play yes yes we should um we just like the Goths at least wanted to let you in on it because they chose is that no because well we're having a meeting with Lord Commander I think that she's our US other most trusted hooded Lantern and I think that she could handle getting Wagner somewhere where he's under supervision maybe nope nope I think we have a lot of people we need to talk to them about lots of things so much talking who-who needs doctors first I think you should see the Lord Commander first okay go see him and we can tell him the Wagner yeah I'm gonna go act on this immediately and she asks for one of the other soldiers to come back in and take you to the load commander's office great okay you guys ready we're telling about the bomb no mention no mention of the bomb no mention of the bomb if we we succeeded to keeping the Queen's men out of this attack how do we do it I don't have to tell him how he'll ask how you might press no we talk to the Queen we reasoned with her and made it worth her while yeah we're going to do for her she also stole our stuff she has her stuff and she promised that we traded your badge is rarely cuz if she took it then we don't have anybody trained and went straight in it and then they go why did you treat such a valuable thing because because it's like a it's like leaving your wallet with someone to be like I'll be back it's collateral appointment it's collateral we left it as collateral that's a collateral in your ring you are brought to the Lord commander's office where he is there with the night captain the two of them are discussing are poring over a map of Drakon Heim and they have laid out in front of them on the Lord commanders table they've laid out all the little pieces indicating their troop movements and all their current holdings and they have sheets of rosters all the information about their troop numbers supplies and all ever around them and they're in mid-conversation and and and you hear the the Lord Commander is finishing a sentence well with Sebastian and Vale and pollute Oh we'll be able to head across the walls and attack as my others come from the with the ropes and you bring in the siege tower so we'll be able to attack completely from above we won't have even have to risk a broad ground aah and the Lord Commander says excellent it's good to see you all we've got some very exciting plans how do things go with the coup with the queen of Thieves they went poorly not horribly we're still here we got what we needed we got what we needed but we we lost our pride our pride the knight commander crosses his arms and he says but you're absolutely certain that she's not gonna go getting involved in anything that we're gonna be doing not in the battle not in the cathedral well that's the best we could hope for I'll be honest I didn't have high hopes that you'd actually be able to take it down but if you made it managed to cut some kind of deal with her to at least make sure she's not gonna interfere that's good enough for me last thing we need is her sabotaging all their operations out here the best we could do is cut a deal with her and it cost us a bit but she spared us our lives and will not be intruding in our plans I think we were able to convince her of the overall benefits of our current operation and she sees a win in that too we'll deal with her in time well apprehend her executors and disband all all of those wretched bandits that are inhabiting the city there is one thing you should know she has a monster not surprising I wouldn't put anything past her she needs some kind of leverage to keep out over things I've heard about that her menagerie that she keeps in her little arena did you have to fight your way through that we did and we fought a creature that took on all three of us and we were defeated and at the brink of death when she called off the fight she spared your lives I wouldn't put that pasture but that's that means she wants something from you that is more or less how we've arranged to to have her not included we haven't really it's kind of a very loose system that we have going on with her right now I was a bettin man as the night captain I would wager that she's hoping on you turning on us well she'd be sorely mistaken because usually when somebody threatens me with monsters and tells me to work for them that doesn't go over well you guys are tried threatening me into things and hasn't gone over well either then so now we're on great working terms she on the other hand is not the nicest person to work with and we won't be turning on you so you didn't make a deal with her that says that we're gonna spare her life or something was all over did you that never came up no no that didn't come up right good I don't think I can fire off what was it oh well yeah it did have to fire off with my most precious artifact but what do you mean and I point to his badge I said the only thing I care about the only way that we could get her not involved with this is I had to give up something that's most precious to me you have to be kidding me would you rather her mess up this whole operation how can the three of you be so foolish and irresponsible as to give her the stewards badge that's what were you possibly thinking when you thought that that would be a good bargaining chip we need that that's an essential thing for our battle plans it's coming back to us Oh Oh Lord Commander we have an understanding with her our mission was to stop her from being involved in this battle and she had us on the ground bleeding to death you realize that with my badge and Bao's badge we could have ordered the gargoyles on the walls to stand down I didn't realize that nobody mentioned that to us critical to our plans well you probably should have told us that before you sent us into their Queens or kept it with you I can't keep it from you it's my oath we can ask for it I would have given it to you if your totally it was that critical look we we what's done is done yeah this is a miscommunication is what this is we were not informed of that see what happens and you keep it a nice finger out we just need to figure out another way to attack from the top of the tower Lord Commander I can't risk my my riders against a bunch of gargoyles they're gonna come flying up I add us off the walls if we try and fly over it yeah we can't have the we can't bring in the sky cavalry that way we're gonna have to call them out of it out of the fight we'll still be able to use the siege tower but if those gargoyles are gonna come up and attack us that part of it we're gonna be in for a real mess of this whole situation how many gargoyles it means that we're going to have to do a ground assault what if we're on the wall taking care of the gargoyles we've done it we've climbed over the wall and survived that's true but once they're riled up they'll keep coming well someone is on the walls what if we get another badge we have time I like what is that what if what if we get another badge not Bears badge but another badge can you still call off the guard once I've been looking for another badge for years it just so happens that part of the bargain that we made with the queen of Thieves points us two possible locations of the other badges if we can find another badge can you doesn't know about these do this she doesn't know she does she have others she seems to have a lot of information about a lot of things she doesn't have any of them but she has clues to where they are which also brings me to something else that we should talk about is how she's gaining this information oh yeah by the way do you have some information for you about that as well the mole that we had discussed we found another prisoner when we were trapped with the Queen go on it was one of the lanterns Roth Wagner Wagner them but Wagner is part of the Queen's Royal Guard yes I sent Petra to apprehend him immediately because there is we don't have the confirmation of this but the fact that we found Wagner alive and we did talk to him briefly we weren't able to rescue him there was too many eyes on us but he didn't know about the Queen and he didn't know who we were he has been missing for some time it seems which leads us to believe that either a that was a ruse to steer us in the wrong direction or be the Wagner that is here is some sort of disguised Minister I'll beat the information I have to my work but no can you magic no commander I'm happy to talk to the flame keeper and ask her to help with us in the south if the queen of thieves has this kind of magic at our disposal shapeshifters are illusions or whatever those things you're gonna need us to root them out because our priests they have a good eye for it we'll root them out if they're in fourth grade no we're gonna have to go through our own people too and make sure that not only gone missing you're gonna have to tell your boys stop going to that brothel down in that amber wood village - Lord Commander I'm terribly sorry for the circumstances that happened during our infiltration of the queen of Thieves things got much more out of hand than we expected I thought we could handle it the queen of Thieves was better prepared than we expected she has monsters she has disguises she has eyes and ears everywhere we were discovered and we barely made it out with our lives I'm sorry for what we lost it would seem that the queen of thieves is a much more dangerous threat than I anticipated yes she's much more than some petty bandit isn't she it seems that way but she's also not going to interfere with the plans that we have next so you don't have to work that to our advantage I must say well commander we're all in this boat together I had 12 of my men abandon less the other day for the cult of the falling fire yeah we met them yeah we met them they shamrocks on their chests it's kind of weird yeah yeah it's hopefully just a fad but they also are you know in doing that impervious to the haze so I mean pros and cons they figured some stuff out yeah that's something worth investigating later thank you yeah maybe you can just pull the gem out later yeah the Lord Commander Davies hopefully as much as you might call them a cult night captain they just seem like normal folks to me sure they've got some crazy beliefs but they're doing some strange things but you're not proposing killing them are you not yet they haven't done anything people you don't like not yet this is track and I'm on threat until they become a threat so I would say let's leave them be until something comes in with less hesitation with that than the rapper that is a hundred percent true and accurate at the end of the day standards it made me laugh Krisha Matthias is a dangerous heretic and we would do well to be careful we don't want to make a modern on her first night we met her yeah and we've read her book I have a copy of the way no it's not her yeah we met Lucretia oh the Krisha you should burn that I'm using it to gather information we also leave little notes in it every book was written by somebody and this book will have clues as to what it is they're after you want to know about Lucretia Mathias there's only one person that you should talk to you that's fili read deal with them we're best friends really yeah well that is a conversation that we will have after we are victorious in battle or maybe immediately on during the zone of truth whoo but we're not going in a zone a true feast and right outside of it so we can liar aphelion tending to the queen Lenore oh how annoying because of the whole no potions from Austria thing I don't know she hasn't told me anything yet what about plans for our attack we're supposed to be going tomorrow I realized that we came with bad information that has seemingly upset the plans that were being put in place but do we have an idea on how we're going to take temple gate the Lord Commander speaks and says originally the plan was that the silver order we're going to come forward with their siege tower that they've constructed we were going to strike from the other side with our grapple guns and leverage the the wall in the city because we can travel across the wall from our barracks to the gate but with out the way is toots or the gargoyles to stand down going across the walls is not possible what about not crossing the wall per se but is there any way to build more structures that are going to give you an advantage and entering from your gates and traveling along the wall on the inside we don't have any ability to build anything inside the city walls it's difficult to bring construction materials inside the city and actually build anything and then move it through the rubble of the city streets is a whole problem in itself but the fact that the silver order was able to assemble one siege tower in the past few days is remarkable to say the least but from what I understand the knight commander continues we've only got enough ox to pull one tower hmm so in in order to even bring it forward and bring it up to the walls we don't have enough soldiers to actually run one of these things and of course if the Noles come out from the gate if they attack us if we suffer too many casualties we're not even gonna be able to push this thing this may not change the entire battle but I did pick up a new skill while I've been gone I can turn people into animals rather large animals we do have a giant ape on our side can't teleport inside the gate can you yes yep me and Pluto we totally can they can I can't I can only do it once I can do it a few times but it's pretty draining if I do it too many times but only yourself really maybe one other person I can we can each take one other person with us we can't get up to the top of the tower of the gate by walking across the walls but you mean that you can literally teleport up there yes literally later the three of you can teleport in and open the portcullis gate does that give us a chance I'd say it gives us fantastic chance if you can do it the only thing that we can hope to do is distract the Knowles long enough so that you don't have too much opposition inside I mean the bloodthirsty animals so the more like to come out and try to fight us but they're gonna leave that gate closed if they have half a brain to them they've got the means to come down off the walls and there's a large number of them around it but we can fight our way up to the front of the wall you can teleport up there and open the gate long enough for us to get enough people in to hold it do you plan to get that siege tower close to the wall that's the plan so put us on the siege tower have us teleport or do you want us on the ground teleporting out well the the idea here would be is if you can open the gates for us and get that thing open from the inside then we can actually send in our cavalry and smash through through it without having to use a battering ram or knock down that gate and once we secure it then that means that we instead of wrecking the gate we can actually open and close it and use that as a functional launch stage for anything you might want to do in the future we can do that it would save us a lot of lives - you draw the Noles out of temple gate and we'll get that gate open yeah whatever it takes now that means that we need you to make enough of an impact that you get as many of those nulls out as possible well we are gonna be coming with all of our soldiers and the hood of lanterns are gonna be attacking from the other side as well so with the lanterns coming in from the city and the silver order coming in from the outside we're gonna be hitting them on both sides then if the gates open the middle we should just be able to cut a swath right through hopefully that'll leave them scatter didn't by the time the Lord of the feast catches on we'll hold the gate and then we push forward after we claim the gate and hold it that would be the idea once we hold temple gate and can secure it we can do that before the Lord of a feast draws it joins the battle from the Cathedral we'll be able to hold it against him the Noles don't have siege weaponry they don't have grapple ladders we've got stupid skilled archers once we hold the gate we'll be able to shoot them like fish in a barrel from the city walls if they dare approach hopefully that will scare them off long enough that they'll retreat to lick their wounds we can recover a resupply and then mount an attack on the Cathedral to hold it in the coming days that sounds like a good plan yeah Pluto can you open a gate yes you're the strongest yeah the the gate then you guys I've never been a person who opens or closes gates in the city is it is it a mechanism that you turn to open a crank is it like a crank sure it's a mechanical system it might take all three of you to open it up or one big one of us yeah if I can turn one of us into a giant ape can the other two then defend that person far I leave that up to you to decide but you've got to get the gate open lock it out into place long enough for us to be able to at least get our soldiers through and then fighting through the tower itself is it the same type of gate that's here no it's not here at Shepards gate the city barracks are built into the gate so the central tower is shared amongst them down at temple gate it's just a small model a a large bar we can style fortress so it's just a singular gate with two flanked by two towers okay we can take that yeah no problem and we're gonna we're gonna spearhead the gate open initiative will be your strike force your dragon force how far away can you do you need to be in order to teleport into this like 500 feet I might need to be a little bit closer yeah I need you to get me 300 feet away from where you want me to teleport to I've tried teleporting further doesn't work doesn't work very well that means that you're probably gonna have to join us as we fight through one of the first waves of nulls that's okay leave us with the pile and hold around and we can ride the batter so then or are you gonna ride with us the silver order or the hooded lanterns on your way to the gate silver order cuz maybe we can get plenty somebody's making - what flamethrowers Cleo Jackson would like a flame term I want to just try one I would say whoever can get us closer whoever has a better chance of getting us closer well if you come with us we'll be able to use the cover of the inner city ruins to hopefully get you very very close through stealth and on the other hand well my Griffin riders can't lie over the walls they can fly us up to the wall yeah we just have to make sure that for Sebastian that none of your guys are around him when he teleports that is one thing to note now this is gonna be a risky move but they'll yes we could ride on the same Griffin jump off the Griffin fall and then teleport it once we're clear of the Griffin sure easy problem I've done this a hundred times in your head I've never done this I don't know no I can't decide you know I know you have pretty close to suicide I mean I was gonna propose we just fly in as close let you off and then you go if you want to do it from the middle of the air that's fine to me oh you're just gonna you're gonna drop us off yeah maybe you should drop us off you can use that as like your bailout but yeah jumping off the Griffin wait until you're like 20 feet down and then the only problem with that is that the Noles are gonna see you coming so wherever they bring you you're you're gonna lose any advantage of surprise if you come in that way what if you put us in the siege tower wield the siege tower within 300 feet and if I have like a little hole to look out I can teleport us yeah but don't see why that wouldn't possible but the siege tower is gonna be one of the last things to come rolling up other lines are gonna be drawn and the Noles are gonna be try that look like it's gonna be the lasted the I'll tell you pretty much that's siege tower that's our plan B you know you also would break it oh right as I explode what I'm also thinking is like check realistically I think yes they're gonna see us but we also only some of us can be stopping yeah really unveil thanks for acknowledging that because I know that you and me could stealth mission this we could stealth mission real good I'm sorry Pluto but were thinking about us as a group we don't leave anyone behind but we need to figure out what the best plan is for the group itself you are the reason we can't sneak into places and we accept you for that we do I just like to talk and be loud to your armor it's it's mostly your armor if I got rid of my armor would that help if you heard of your armor how would you be in a fight why would you go to battle without your armor blow no that just makes no sense yeah you're right it doesn't make any sense so I'm gonna be loud so I think the urban riders might be our best and I fly Griffin you know how I guess the fact that I asked it like that means no I'll have one of my one of my soldiers fly each of you will fly in as close as we can and then you'll be able to hop off will land on one of the rooftops nearby you leap off you do your magical little thing you get yourselves in there but then how do we get there we're not going away we're not going to get out it's easier to read I know the gate the Gateway so how it off the game you are going to have to hold your position there yeah until we can fight our way in very we stay there until the Noles are not there anymore how do we take on the gargoyles going out of the city if we really need it Ludo Jackson yay you are a renowned monster hunter yes you still trolls yes you've killed one bridge worth of minotaurs yes are you afraid of Noel's no that's what's the problem well I I know I was trying to think of it is there a way we can get in there without teleporting and then we could tell we'd have a fight our way in yeah and we have to it with it with teleport in teleport and fight our way reason why we wanted to come down the wall all's and use the grapple guns on the siege towers so that we don't have to batter down the gate we're gonna save the game can you fly us in as a giant bird I don't think you can fly yes he can fly I mean I've never turned into a bird before but I've been an ape and I've been enable but can you be like a big bird I think they'd see it coming more teleport at least like they think we're on one side but then we actually end up on the other so you don't want me to try turning into a bird also if we try and turn into a bird I don't know yet I've turned into a giant like ten foot tall eight and I trust I mean if you can turn into a bird then like a big bird like they could ride you big bird aye-aye once again this is all experimental but maybe if my theory is correct on how my magic to your question is maybe yes cuz then you could just fly those to radon in what can I practice yeah you better [Laughter] think I'm gonna try turning into a bird I also have the idea that if we are not able to defend our position at least if we need to take a little break I have rope trick so we can kind of get out of there to DM note he said that because if you puppy you how many fourth level spell slots you got there Sebastian that's true so if I bird we can't ape Pluto oh we need to eat Pluto yeah we don't need to but it will be the difference of if he's an ape he might be strong enough to or I mean honestly but then we can defend among he's open obviously guys maybe I ate myself or you could be aged in a weak and dependent that way I can turn it in that way you two you two both are better in a battle than I am I'm just a smooth talker who knows a few tricks you can fight you just all right wishy well maybe my value in this mission is to is to open that gate yeah crank it that's that's gonna be a gate time decision okay so with that we're gonna fly in you're gonna teleport in or bird yourself in you decide you practice as soon as that gate gets open I'm gonna send in my riders and hopefully we're gonna be able to and with a good charge those knows what Knowles won't see what's coming we'll be able to trample raid our way through and between us and the hood of lanterns we're gonna fight our way to you as fast as we can but once you get that gate open you're gonna have to hold out until we get to you are we defending are we you're talking about holding out as defending the open gate or are you talking about like we just gotta survive you're gonna have to survive oh do you want us to stay put we're gonna have to or else the Knowles are gonna close the gate okay so we do need to defend Zee today's opening mechanism yep yeah makes sense okay I hope that we get to rejoice together with the taking of temple gate and if I die tomorrow come on if it happens hmm please write some sort of story about me being a great hero like you opened the gate valiantly confidently with courage and charisma I think you just tried to give me a pep talk about Sebastian killing monsters don't you can't have these thoughts that's not a creme brulee attitude okay you have you know no wills or obituaries or eulogies are gonna be written if you give your lives in the name of this will record you in the book of our fallen I got a statue on the on the bridge yeah tell my dad I love them I mean we'll look all of this we'll try this is I'm gonna give you a little lesson if somebody who might die asks for something to be done after they die you just say yes and they're happy but you don't actually have to but anyway no we get one whole statue together as a tract and for you as we need to we'll honor you however we can I just hope you take that bridge back yeah because what if everyone dies well then nobody hunters anybody in the Knowles rule dragon time and problem solved I guess our troubles will be over none of us made a deal with the demon so we're not gonna thank you we sure didn't alright we have a few more logistics to work out on our end I'm going to go after this I'm going to talk to her can we come absolutely I'll meet you down on the dungeons in an hour okay but we also need to talk to Alfie Leah I reckon that's a good idea she's with the Queen she is okay the Queen else needs to talk to us too thank you Lord Commander your plan sounds excellent and I'm excited to fight alongside you well I mean we're going to be separated but in spirit you in spirit alongside you can we just go well it's just that you know right a sort of iteration trying this new thing where i'm like respectful and nice to like people who are power rather than just trying to talk down to them like I'm better than them it's uh but you are better than them I just spells we should go to the mess hall and get a snack before we have any more conversation yeah we just we're on the eve of actually no that's the perfect time to get a snack we're on the eve of that even battle Gus stuff my face is much less well maybe I'll never get to eat food again after this she's creme brulee creme brulee I just remind me have any creme brulee can't see no way yeah they don't know currently they got some decent meat pies ah is it grabs one as we had is it also like it's meat meat peas and carrots yeah in like you know pretty thick gravy I want that now so bad yeah I know we just ate and I want to move I know my partner made a bunch of meat pies for this week and I had one last night and I was so good and I can't and I just told her just make these pies every night so that's that's why I had to mention pies because that's all I can think about right now so these food why it's all I can think about as I'm in my mouth we all eat our meat pies I eat three vo sebastian signals taking the pies as you walk up the stairs yep alright I guess we Joe and Jill do not eat pies and we're very sad about it um are we seeing the Queen er there together yeah but are we gonna talk to them to you that may be why is there something that we don't want to say to what you want to ask Ophelia privately about the condition of the Queen yes condition but also falling fire right yeah probably don't need the Queen knowing about that did you head up into the apartments above the Queen's Guard are all in place and sitting outside the Queen's private chamber is the feeling read the philia is a pretty large woman there very round and but she's got like that very warm face like she could be like your favorite aunt that made you meat pies and as you as you come up the stairs she she smiles and she says I'm so glad to see that you are not dead we are going to not be deadly I don't feel good yeah good tidings y'all very mixed up in your hearts though I can tell that you don't really know who you can trust in this city do you we're starting to figure out we had a big meeting about that today still debate sure this is the type of place that just it this city it idols mom I'll tell you even being in here so close to all them all that haze I can feel the evil and my balls here yeah we've been in this we have been in this city for a while now and I'm telling you right now oh yeah we've seen we've seen some we saw a floating heart just in in a building we people are made of glass I don't even know you know it's wobbling that makes people believe some strange things about this world over you were you were friends you were close with Lucretia how was you we were very good friends many many years what do you think of the the falling fire in her path we we met her recently when did she do that when did she flip the switch there's only a few months after it happened for us the meteor but even before then she'd been talking about it she'd been saying that she was watching the Stars listening listening to the flame thinking about what the future would hold but what she's saying is not right she is talking about some coaches her couches her words and all this talk of an age of heroes and a glorious time to come but our faith is about standing vigil there is no age but the age that we're keeping we got to keep watch we got to keep lighting our candles because they're the only thing holding back the darkness she thinks that there's something out there that's coming to save us but that's not we teaching the flame we are the light in this world we are the broadness and if we don't let our flame shine there's no darkness I do agree that the views of their people are little intense but I can't help but ignore the fact that here's a group of people in this room in this fort who are striving to be heroes and bring upon an age a better age so it's not unheard of her her views we had a very confusing conversation I don't doubt it I've a lot of people that have followed her have had similar incidents the ones that I've had which was confusing for me I don't necessarily agree with their views but we might be the heroes we might be the people who are going to bring on a new age for dragonhide and I'd like to believe that there might be a new age for dragging on but she's talking about a new age for this world something coming that's strange and unexplainable that we don't know the flame tells us that this is the last age of the world and that we are here to stand vigil over it and watch it with light and that the darkness will always be there and we must be that light what she's talking about is an age without darkness an age that sounds like a free ride for everybody and that's not what we teach our faith our place in this world is something that we fight for that we believe in that we think is worth protecting she's telling people that they can just stab these stones and lap their fires and shine all this brightness across the world that puts out all the darkness like they'll never have to do anything again they won't have to work for anything like things won't ever change again after that but we know that the world doesn't work that way the world is what we make it in the world is what we protect and what we believe in the flame will guide us the flame will light our path but is it our role to be the keepers of that plane to be the bearers of that torch the tenders of the her she's saying there's some easier road and I don't believe it anyone that thinks there's easy answers in this world is selling something I agree with you on that question you're the the the silver order believes that this is the last age what do you mean by that do you mean are you are you talking about world ending or are you talking about this age is just going to stretch on for a very long time the Canon of the true fire says that the age of the world shall endure until the last flame is put out and we mean to keep the flame Lord how to keep working you never say anything about a great event become like a like a meteor there are many revelations from the song of fire to the Book of flaming blades that speak of different times of different prophecies of great heroes coming but all of that is coached in lat bearers that make the world shine brighter push back the darkness but it is core to our belief that that darkness will always be there we can push it back we can shine brightly but it is but ours as a path of constant and unending vision hmm I agree with I don't know I just to us there is no age after this age there's only darkness I think I think I think we can all say that sounds terrible be in a world of darkness I mean I'm invisible in darkness I'm born in darkness so I am super scared of the dark and I'm gonna share this are you happy all the times I've cast darkness you never brought this up I thought I was doing you a favor I don't especially don't he got stabbed like six times well in my darkness I thought I was helping to keep the lights on for Pluto yeah and if you ever want to know for me why when you look up at the night sky you see the stars points of light in a world of darkness we're about a little point of life in a world of darkness and where'd that falling star come from that great dark that's up there actually can't remember the last time I saw the stars with all the clouds in Gemini yeah it's been months I was village remember fishing know that fallen star I saw a few stars it's not a herald of a new light its darkness cast as light into this world and what it's come in here is to deceive us and they've taken that deception into their hearts literally oh yeah I didn't think it was very safe either so I agree with you there that's why you know we got to destroy every last bit of that corrupted rock has to be this road I agree because otherwise it's gonna spread it sickness I can see the value in that I look yes and if you want a more convincing case of that sickness what happens with that sickness you only need to go through that door Oh how's the Queen doing have you cured her yet it's it bad is it worse does she have a new laser appendage ease she hasn't had any I went and looked through what that man made for her and it's just more toxin poison and that toxin and all that poison that's what's keeping her in this world the only way she survives is with it I think the best thing for her is to let her go unfortunately and I don't mean to be harsh about this because you know her life is her life may be miserable right now and it might just get worse but in our goal of reclaiming Drakon time until we find any of her children she is one of our best tickets protecting dragonhide Queen Lenore was a bright soul and she's suffering in there and she doesn't even know it because all that corruption has addled her mind and you want to keep her in this world you want to stain her soul for that I'm sorry but I think that's wrong I think that but there may be any hope of her spirit having any freedom of peace we can't let this continue she's lived in pain for 15 years and I've worked miracles in my time I've purged disease I've brought people back from the brink of death but I've never seen anything like that that's evil and I can't abide it lady Ophelia I'm no lady just call me a feeling the trains exist in this world sidenote no okay what I was gonna use an analogy but not of it not in train sonic says okay what if keeping her alive saves thousands of people by helping us reclaim dragonhide and what if losing her means that thousands of people could die I'm gonna ask my two my two comrades here just do I'm gonna help do you see value in keeping her alive like I don't know what her value is but I feel like she is our biggest bargaining chip right now and two if it if one person and keeping her alive and miserable can help save the whole city yeah it's the greater good no it's it's not just that the Lord Commander loves his Queen he obeys his queen but if we don't get her any more of that if we don't keep pumping poison into a body I don't know what's gonna happen to her mind the Lord Commander Lemay's when she speaks and we neutralized the situation by giving her what she needs until we can be sure that her fate isn't tied to draggin him so you want to pump more poison into a body you want to keep doing this to her I don't want to but we have to you have to also understand a feeling of it I can't abide that I think that's wrong that's sick we all do a lot of things we don't want to do in Dragon hime welcome to the city I've been doing things I don't want to do for 15 years because of this mess and I'm just trying to get everybody out of it so that way they don't have to live like this anymore I think y'all been wandering around the doing what you think you have to do because you're scared of getting burned when you turn on a lot I can tell you clone around in the darkness like this there's no way to live I've lived my whole life in the darkness I've never been one for standing out in the light just how I am I'm sorry to hear that me too I think she's right the she's not the Queen anymore she's a monster driven by this toxic plague okay so we distrust the most in the city all have it jammed in their chest I mean we treated like a commodity but it's it's a it's a magical poison that infests the city and Julie I need a moment alone and and I I don't know if we we are torturing her existence is torture you know what am I gonna say this and she's she's she's family you're not you're not right oh yeah this is the hardest room and technically I think I have that thing where I have to make the decision no I'm because I'm the closest just just hear me out on this for a second okay what's that power of attorney no attorney are you guys gonna be tough but yes if we lose the Queen hmm all right so that is the silver orders decision not the hooded Lanterns the hooded lanterns the Lord Commander probably has the exact opposite viewpoint on this so by making that decision we lose this alliance favorite lanterns will be furious we will break ties with that by making that choice you don't know any of that this is not a decision Lord Commander will obey the Queen that needs to be made now it's like can we not wait till after the battle to make this huge political decision it's a big move it's a big move and I think if the pieces are moving if we can wait if we can hold off and see where the pieces lie then maybe we can give her peace but she's the only thing that could potentially bring peace to Dragon hime and I'm not gonna give that up in order to make sure that one person isn't poisoned by the Delirium trust me plenty of people have been poisoned by delirium but none of them are the Queen I recognize that there's need for discretion right now because of our alliance but when the others of the silver order find out what's happened Illinois they're not going to accept it I also want to keep in mind that you're talking about killing the queen of Dragon home which is treason it's I think it's less about killing her and more like letting her die that's there's a different emotion to keep her I'm not a citizen of bracket huh but you're here I'm here under the Queen's roof and I'm not saying to murder her is wrong so letting her live letting her go on like this it's torture and that's wrong too and I don't think anything good to come from it no more than anything good can come from all the other monsters that infest the city I my one concern when you mentioned that the night Lord Commander would do anything for her if her mind slips to anywhere like it was when we found her and she decides that she doesn't want to have Brent like what if she decides that she turns on the hooded lanterns and we make that decision when it come I don't disagree with you but I'm not saying Killary now but all I'm saying is that I think philia has a point I think she does too I just it's poison way out our options and what impact it could have because there's gonna be a ripple effect yes yeah yeah and we need to be aware of possible ripples but we also run at a time I don't think we have any more how much doses do we have as we were weaning haven't been given there anything said not to we could give her delirium like we could just give her rod de Larroque I know this is the same world we live in society we have to give her what she needs to live or we have to let her die but these are the decisions we can't just keep playing this game of sustenance our decision yeah the Lord Commander should be informed of this yeah but we're because we won obviously you guys want the Queen to live I don't want her to live oh there it is I don't think like she doesn't get what she needs she's gonna die anyway guys I don't know if you guys have ever had to put down an animal that you she's the only tie we have right now to the royal families all I'm saying is is that it seems like you guys have some trouble making some of these tough decisions I've had to put down and murder a lot of the people that I love you didn't put them down they were even played about how we work in a murderer also murder we will consider this we will consider it but I think for now we should sustain her until we can make a decision we have more pressing things needing rather than dealing with losing our queen again listen we're gonna address this after the fight tomorrow could we potentially use her laser eyes in the fight just throwing it out there I don't think we want to put the Queen on the frontlines to be honest I mean it solves all issues like we should just literally laser eye the know old people and I think that would be kind of cool I like where your head's at I don't necessarily agree it's just that it forget it you know get two birds I'll say this one stone I've done everything I can for her hmm there's a good spirit and hurt you could let that spirit free or you can let it rock and she takes remove things don't run things don't rot dragon dragon hime look olive branch Mike draw Vera Sebastian this is a decision that might get made for us if we don't have a solution you know what though it's better if it's made for us rather than we make that decision and the Lord Commander finds a note that we decided to let the glue dry we won't just we he can be informed it's just what if we found a way to reverse what's happened to her yeah would you be okay with that cuz that's something we haven't even tried well that's the thing I was like let's look at all our options because if Alfie leah is one person that's looked at her and and I feel like her judgments may be a little bit clouded with fire I'm just saying she's got a lot fire going on Lane could get be in a way of the vision I think there's other options but I don't think that letting her die for the sake of dying he's very cool we need to bring Oscar yarn back no no no no no no III think Orfalea means well and to clarify just to given Adam if it helps your decision Afilias conclusion is simple delirium will sustain Oscar yarn solution will sustain her and keep her lucid but if she doesn't have either goals she'll probably be dead in a week in a week so delirium won't sustain her and keep her lucid she will be sustained but not lucid Oscar urine solution keeps her lucid meaning that she is still capable of making decisions meaning that I don't even know if I want to go in this room right now and talk to the Queen if with delirium alone she'll probably go mad again in a week with nothing she'll die in a week but with both she'll can she'll be fine but her condition will not and the only person who has access to the keeping or lucid that we know of his Oscar your but do we have any of his solutions she said she hasn't given us any figure out so--that's listen we haven't talked to the amethyst Academy yet the amethyst Academy says they'll contact us when they need us and we haven't heard from them in like a week there are four doses of Oscars Bjorn's solution remaining how long do they last dose that each dose she needs a daily dose daily so we could get her a week and four days really before yeah I'd say let's just stain her for four days and then yeah we have to solve the problem of getting her more solution curing her illness or deciding what to do with I don't think giving her delirium is a right solution if it's not going to keep her mind well that's if you ever realize that like every time that we do anything in Dragon hime it's always like we have this many days before another massive horrible thing happens like what like a three-day weekend I want to like go shopping this is why I'm thinking of my retirement plan Pluto yeah you want a me day don't you I want an us day oh I mean I was but you caught me so uh any planning I just want to get you under play table tube with my food and roll down the drain River and then at the end I can collect you and put you bringing up the back to the top and so you can do it all again yeah all right so we have four days plus a week before the Queen dies before we need to figure out a solution we have a day before we're going into battle we have a plan to take the top of the game we have a mole right Wagner we're going to talk to the Queen have a queen that's becoming ever less unhinged or more unhinged more in hinge we should talk to her and see what's going on see how she feels ready to go in yeah we should dismiss she already left I knock on the door oh thank you you may come in there's a regular knocking sound and okay wherever we are I walk in again doing a very deep bow my queen welcome back it's so good all of you are back I understand the preparations are underway for the battle yes yes this is good this is good do you think you could see to it that I have some of those lovely crystals unfortunately those crystals are hard to come by but we can see if we can get you some of those potions that Oscar was giving him good we did go deep into the city and it's becoming harder and harder to get those crystals I've been feeling rather strange like I don't feel so well I'm sure it's fine but I the doctors medicine was helping it seemed it helps and hinders I do any word of my children after the battle that is one of our we don't have any new information we've been proud to speed we'll fill you in we only know nothing we we have an aim to find out more information through this battle to get to the Cathedral that is our first clue our first aim the arrow the direction we're being pointed in most excellent how do you feel are you feeling I feel tired somewhat sick but I am hopeful would you like a meat pie no I'm fine thank you oh okay okay well was there anything you wanted to talk to us about or did you just want to see us and make sure we're okay at this time no I wanted to see you after the battle if you have no updates on my children there's not much to say we've where's your father's badge in order to make sure the preparations go or this battle I had to temporarily give it up but my Lord Commander didn't seize it from you did he no no no it was a mission right to bear that I agree but sacrifices had to be made in order to make sure we are triumphant with getting information about your children from the Cathedral in order to make sure we could get there I had to temporarily put it in others hands it is distressing my ring is gone too I haven't seen it since well back in the day I remember you wore it quite frequently you haven't been wearing it lately I know I seem to remember having it maybe we can check the cathedral for you maybe it was with the other artifacts that are there with all the confusion in the city trinkets become lost as long as your father's badge is safe there are with this the stewards badge and my ring guard passageways that lead into Castle drakon for the security and protection of myself you must understand those two items can get us into the castle only through my private passengers that's bad well we have it on good faith that we are getting the badge back and we'll make sure to find that ring we'll keep a close eye out for it what Thank You Queen yes all of this is things we knew knew well I'm done with this conversation I'm going to go wait outside and Sebastian walks out and you just here behind the door my queen I think there are other concerns that our party needs to be privy to outside including the security of this facility so we must this is true again it only leads to the Royal Apartments the rest of the castle proper there was any other protection still in place there we would need other others but with the Lord Commander there would be much more [Music] well we are starting to put the pieces together that'll lead us to figuring out how to get into the castle and we're finding your children and the heirs to dragon home milady and I take another deep bow I must take my leave but please I will send up the potion to make sure that you're feeling better yes your majesty sorry your majesty huh I also now please take care of yourself I wouldn't rest we got I wrote the door that was discipline as we get outside oh come on we had a key to one of the rooms in the castle we don't even know where the secret is better than everybody else in track and I'd be like we don't know it's the Queen with all of her freaking knowledge and stuff knows not only that they are keys but also how to get in I'm sure she can I think the queen of thieves just went very high on our kill list yep and we don't know how to kill her we got a we're slowly putting together her master plan and she made us think that we were friends that's the thing that makes me the maddest is that I liked her and I feel trick I didn't know votes felt I was warming up to her I'm always she tricked me I'm excited I'm gonna take out all my vengeance on what's his name Walter Wegener wagon it's impossible as you sit down the the Queen's Guard changes over and one of the other guards steps into the room one of one of Petra's close closer companions a woman named Elena Krieger and she steps forward the only guard in the room and her voice changes and she says I gave Rolf that I think it would be better he kept this between us for the time being are you guys freaking out right now because I'm you gave what brought back the the says the soul the put Atlanta and soldier weight Wagner was given back you don't recognize me do you are you the queen you're so sneaky I just said I glad you wag nur you save ya he might not remember what happened I've given them back I'm keeping her what's why are you telling us so that you just know how hard behind the game war yeah can we have the ring back why is it important it turns out you knew that it was and that's what makes your questions so mean I'm going to hang out here for the next couple days just to keep an eye on things I was counting on you turning in Wagner and now you're going to all look like idiots in front of Lord Commander happens often honestly yeah what's what if we just told everyone that you're here right now I'm counting on you doing it oh I will no I'm not gonna tell anyone that you're here and that'll show you playing right into my trap hmm I feel like either way regardless of what we do you're gonna have someone here so there's really no point in letting them know future look I have one thing to say to you Bravo that was really cool like how you do all this I'm really mad at you but at the same time I'm super impressed and I'm kind of scared and all of it is creating a really mixed bag of emotions in my body right now and I don't know how to really respond and that's why I'm kind of being monotone but I'm really scared and angry and furious and nervous it's like a lot thank you don't worry I'll watch your back I know that things are gonna be a little bit tense tomorrow and so I'll see if I can't swap out with one of the other soldiers that's going with that Anson fellow and keep an eye on how things are going okay thanks so much yeah great so great we will let you know how things go in the Cathedral I guess what did you hear that we said about you I was very flattered thank you so much we'll talk about it next time sneaky Queen [Music] everything in the tower let's just assume that she's heard everything we've ever said about her ever listen yeah let's just assume that she yeah she knows let's just assume that she knows everything her death is coming on the hands of us we're not even gonna be quiet because she knows that I just put her on the top of my kill list scares me more than you're saying thank you to me putting her on the kill list I'll tell everyone you hear it I hope you do no that's a reverse psychology now I don't know what to do what game am i playing this is just like boggle we shouldn't we should just play killer games yeah let's play for keeps yeah let's play for keepsies
