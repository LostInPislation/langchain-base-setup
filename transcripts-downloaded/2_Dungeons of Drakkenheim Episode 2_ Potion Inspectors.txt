[Music] Drakken dimers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] hello and welcome back my name is Monte Martin thank you so much for your patience while we resolved that little bit of an audio sync issue we had some last minute crashes with OBS before we launched the stream today and hope and it seems like a couple bugs wormed their way into the system but please let us know if there's anything that we can do technically to improve and we'll keep an eye on it and try to sort things out as we go along we really appreciate the feedback and let us know and we want to make sure these things are are as ironed out as they can be for our garage / basement level streaming setup so just to round it out again welcome to Drakon hein and my name is Monte Martin and I'm Kelly McLaughlin and we are the dungeon dudes and we are joined in Drakon hein by our good friends Jill tinnitus and Joe or Goran and we are delving back into dragon hime with our characters and if you can just let us know who your characters name is in their class and we'll dive right back into it I'm Pluto Jackson I'm a fighter and I'm here right here how can i you i'm sebastian crow i'm a half-elf shadow sorcerer and I like to set things on fire occasionally and I'm veo Sonia and I am a third-level - Boxey a gloom stalker Ranger and I'm here to lead these two through the city we'll see how that goes well it's been going great great I guess we can we'll go with great for now an enthusiastic great CEO might disagree as last time they ventured back into the ruins of Dragon hime in search of a massive shard of delirium a strange crystal which has been found in the ruins but it's said to be pieces of the meteor which wiped out dragon hime 15 years ago this potent magical crystal has strange and unpredictable and somewhat addictive properties and thus the amethyst Academy at the test of your old friend River had sent you into Dragon hime to recover a large shard of it which you did and with your lives in fact but with another a little bit more in tow perhaps than you expected as you make your way from the ruins of the rat's nest tavern with a another survivor in tow a member of the hooded lanterns the old city watch by the name of petra you who you found in the burrows beneath the rat's nest itself petra herself unwilling to travel the city ruins alone has asked to camp the night the rest of the night with you so that she might follow you back into the city tomorrow or when you head in next to hopefully make it back to the barracks of the city watch where she resides Petra is a rather quiet and reserved traveling companion she's short and slightly built with and at first now that you see her in the moonlight you think she could be a teenager but she definitely has the bearing of someone that's probably in her mid-20s once you see her her capabilities in the field she's very aware of her surroundings but quite quiet she has auburn hair brown eyes and you can see that she's almost always scanning in the distance for potential threat she's very much Oh someone aware of the dangers of the city as you move forward she keeps close by you as you move through the city streets back out towards the outskirts and I'll turn it over to you on to decide how you'd like to proceed from here I'm very muddy acid I got a lot of acid you look like you could kind of acid washed your armor I do have a bag full of barbecued rat skewers though so I know we can eat we can eat tonight top of my priority leg full of delirious like you you you kind of kind of buzzed over the fact that it's super addictive and it explodes around magic and stuff and then I'm just hearing a piece of my backpack are you not thrilled how do you feel I I feel like a like a like a mule I feel the spendable that's why we brought you along you are you are the one who carries their oil tea I think we need to get it off our hands and get it back to River before we do anything so I feel like that should be kind of priority number one especially in these dark and dangerous streets ah let's head back to the mill and that's where River will meet us and we can offload the goods from our mule and wait Ola Plato Oh Pluto sorry not meal isn't name I forgot and yeah we will take care of Petra and get her back home safely hopefully maybe I figured that Petra I mean she doesn't have to know what we're doing with River she can kind of be off in the distance but we'll hang out at the camp and we'll go up to the mill yeah keep it on that hedge oh are you okay with barbecued rat for dinner sounds delicious well good we make do with what we've got normally we do try to head outside the city when we can the the forests are quite overgrown and there's quite a lot of wildlife that's returned to the outskirts around the city it's good hunting actually but in the city food is scarce and you got to get what you can eat philia girl I feel yeah yeah it's it's one matter when you're just eating for one but with a whole company of soldiers trying to make it work in the city supplies are a big problem for us so we've had to eat some pretty disgusting things in our time well I can tell you one location where you can find plenty of barbecued rats we left an entire pit filled with it so yeah we try not to eat the rat folk though a few of us have gotten really sick from eating them you you weren't actually eating the rat folk themselves I take like types of arm and like shove it back in my bag I'm like no of course not it's you have to be really careful out here they're the creatures have all that haze infused in them and I've seen people just it's a pretty ugly way to die suffice to say I just eat whatever I want so hopefully I haven't had anything kooky epidemic because of this haze does this have anything to do with the fact that you can touch the Delirium and we can't does that also mean you can eat these things and we can't because I was under the impression that if you ate it I could eat it and now I'm a little concerned you've been the guinea pig for this so maybe we should find a different guinea pig yeah one that's more in line with our values a little bit more in that way so I might continue to eat whatever I can get my old paws on so yeah to the mill you're staying at the Eckerman mill yes that place is a trash heap we stay where we can't insult your house so I come in and let you know that your little camp is a little bit messy no we leave a lot of graffiti there and I've seen it sometimes on runs we have to stop by there to clean out the last person who got stabbed in the back by their old companions in there definitely like one star at a five readings but I mean a roof is a roof you know could take what we get yeah I saw the rat's nest it wasn't really a great that's not a better place to stay no I guess it's one of the best places to stay if you want to if you want to avoid the taxes of the city and stay inside its jurisdiction although I would have thought a lot of people would have used amberwood Village for that was I supposed to be paying taxes this whole time living in the city well of course I mean the hood lanterns still need to collect their dues for protecting the city I mean I've been paying the taxes the whole time I don't know you're talking about we have no need to go to amberwood village it's a little far we're good we're good with the mill right all right for now go to the mill and we'll see what happens it's the late hours of the night far far past midnight as you trudge back through the city streets along the back roads of Shepherds way up through the current Hills before four after about an hour of traveling the Eckerman mill only lying a few miles outside the city can be seen it's there that you you make your camp for the evening Petra herself volunteers to help set your camp and set the perimeter and the watch she holds her wait in the camp and very quickly kind of almost assuming like you you all know how to set a fire right I I definitely know how to set a fire I'm usually the one who sets the fire around here we don't want to attract too much attention but this late at night this far out of the city there shouldn't be anything that really posed as much of a threat out here I cast fire bolt at the fire front she Huddle's up in her cloak and kind of asking asks for a bit of water and finds a nearby creek to fill up and she kind of like starts washing the mud out of all of her clothing and the bits of blood and everything else that's a that's there do the rest of you set down for the evening I think so I need to wash up my cloaks a little dirty I got a bit of mud on it I almost fell once in there as you're washing Petra asks you didn't see if there were any others down there were there living or dead I didn't see anybody it was really dark for some reason I could see fine I had a lot of trouble seeing I'm going to these do but I'm pretty sure we cleansed it your friend be like people or yeah I don't know if you saw any other how did lanterns or anyone else that might have been down there I didn't but are you looking for somebody in particular the rest of my unit oh um no I mean no signs of humans or anyone but that could be a good sign you didn't see if they had taken any of the supplies or any of the other anything else that we're bringing back what were you bringing back well we uh me and the others of my unit we are the supply runners for the hooded lanterns we had outside it's our job to head outside the city and meet with whoever we can get to supply us with with anything and we were bringing back you know some medicines band-aids some chemical supplies few other it's a food and dry goods maybe I'll try to get a squad and see if we can go back there later yeah I mean we didn't see anything of that sort but just be careful if you go back we will I worry that the silver the silver order has probably had a chance to look in there now after our run is she sighs loudly and says it wouldn't surprise me as noble as they are everyone the city makes a scavenger out of everybody you're not wrong that's fine well I wasn't exactly looking for much down there I was just trying to stay alive while we were being covered in rats so wasn't my priority unfortunately so I can't really what were you doing down there anyways I used to go there to drink and I thought I would hit up the whole place see how it was doing and next thing I know Pluto fell in a hole and like come on dive bars right like they really took the name too far you and I both know that place was completely destroyed why did you go down there did you see my squad get attacked I mean I heard some squeaking and automatically when I hear squeaking in this town I go for the rats because like we mentioned food for me were pest control we are hired to take care of pests we we had known that there was a infestation we had to go cleanse it I really like the word cleanse I'm gonna keep using it as often as I can today it usually means scorched earth to kill all we just accept this was kind of our first foray it's kind of like a test to see if we're ready to take on something bigger who was paying you to come into the city to kill rats that's normally our job no one just could do gooders I used to live here and so we kind of met up and she does live here I used to live here and he's here because he just wants to I don't know represent his I honestly thought this was like what you do here all right Sebastian give me a deception check it's just it's just it's part of the course 24:00 um she eyes you skeptically but hearing about how you grew up in the city she her eyes kind of widen up a little bit she says so if you want to fight for your homeland you could come back and you could join up with us at the hooded lanterns we we don't have many spellcasters but you'd have safety security lots of friends in camaraderie if what you want to do is good in the city that's what we're fighting for we're just trying to make our home our home again I that's a noble concept I'm a bit of a freelancer so my idea was go in kill all the rats and then come to you guys and say hey I killed all those rats you should pay us all those people out there fighting wars because they're all trying to stand on their own we're here in the city working together trying to do the right thing if you want to stand on your own and die be my guest but you could talk to the commander he would I'm sure we're always looking for more recruits what if we want to be freelance agents who help you out from time to time I mean I don't know why you do that but you maybe I could introduce you to the commander and the others when we head back towards the barracks yeah I don't see why we couldn't talk to him I've talked to him before he's alright good yeah she doesn't push the issue that much further and kind of quiets down through the rest of the evening unless there's anything that you'd like to do or unless you'd like to continue talking to each other the night can pass I think I need a nap and a clean my armor I think I'm sitting by the fire because I don't go to bed with sopping wet fur so um I need to stay up a little bit and dry off first bath and months I very meticulously clean my my coat I really wanted to look nice for tomorrow I don't like mud or dirt all righty the evening passes each of you taking your turns with a watch and a rather impotent daybreak signals a new day the rain pitter patters in the morning and that's kind of the first sign that it's morning is the rain as the night stars fade away and and are taken up again by the daily clouds which hang over Drakon Heim um looks good it looks like it's going to be a normal rainstorm today oh toxic yeah that's good and as you as you take your breakfast the Petra starts packing up her things and turn turns to you all and says are you ready to make way back into the city we have to meet an old friend here in a few moments so we're gonna have a quick little chat with our old friend and then we can be on our way all right let's go why are you meeting them in the middle uh yeah okay I can keep a watch for you if you'd like yeah if you wouldn't mind like hanging out here keeping a watch we just need to have a quick chat and I haven't seen our friend in a while so we're just gonna go up and talk to her all right it's no more than a few minutes later as you head back up to the to the Eckerman mill that you can hear the familiar loud boot steps of rivers guardian coming over the the hill and kind of sitting on the steps of the window waiting for it to approach rivers uh being able to see River by by daylight just kind of reminds you how unsettling she is to look at she is a tiefling after all and she's one of those two flings that her teeth are just a little bit too pointy and her tongue is just like a little bit too long and so she's not unpleasant to look at but after she says she's talking for a while there's just something about her mouth it's like that's weird yeah she talks I'm just like horrified but then I keep trying to make eye contact just to make sure she doesn't think I'm offending her and as usual she River is a short tiefling woman with mottled brown skin and blue hair and in in the rain her cloak is her cloaks hood has turned up but as she steps into the the mill with you and after greeting you and smiling warmly she pulls her hood down and you all know that the the reason why she's been called river or years and years is because her hair is blue and her horns kind of look like boats kinda the way they curved back in her hair and it was a nickname that she got as a very young child and so much so that in fact you don't think she's ever told you her actual name no I definitely not I thought that was her actual name and B aside from the the purple cloak of the amethyst Academy River travels quite practically she wears kind of like riding breeches and leathers and leather shop traveling jerkin and she she smiles warmly as she comes in the middle but she does she very conspicuously sees the sees Petra and as she comes into the middle she's like I didn't ask for an extra associate whose clothes was she not far enough away no she's over in the camp I mean she probably saw River coming now well I wasn't gonna leave her to die down there she kind of is she kind of looks behind her and says all right hopefully this will put your worries at ease and I removed the backpack and I hand it to her she sees the backpack and she motions for her bodyguard to grab it and the the bodyguard a large suit of plate mail with a blackened face that you can't see underneath the visor comes and picks it up and you can see that the its arm kind of like lowers limba that it wasn't expecting something quite that heavy and it's opened up the bag and pulls out the piece of delirium which is a this massive crystalline shower that it has to hold in two hands and you see rivers eyes just go wide just like that is a lot more than we were expecting the biggest piece of shiny we've gotten so far you're welcome we deliver oh I also have these I take out smaller shards that we collected you'll you'll have to forgive me a bonus is certainly in order for a find like this but I'm gonna have to see to it that you're more adequately compensated as she reaches into her cloak and produces of a bag of gold that weighs as much as the shard and kind of passes it back pass it back tip two to all of you and you Pluto's eyes wife [Laughter] this can buy food she she kind of and manouse a that she opens up her the other side of her cloak and produces a paper package and an insider are a selection of salmon haddock and tuna like delicate twelve fish we got what we want yeah just like I'm just like jumpy a little bit cuz I'm so excited I'm like can we get out of here so I can eat these fish river says they don't eat all the ones sitting no guarantee and you two gentlemen don't spend it all in one place if you go to ember wood village don't spend it all at the gilded lantern don't tell me how to spend my well hey if you ever have other other work for us I feel like we're all happy to oblige especially if payment is in such quick response and if you ever want to meet us at the guild Lantern for a few drinks it's on us because we apparently are rolling in cash that might go a little ways but this is a much larger find than we anticipated and you should be paid to measure Utley with that let me see what I can do there's really unless you go to ember wood village there's not much you're going to do with that gold here in the city so try to keep it safe that means I have to go to amber wood village I mean we're going to Everwood Village later I'm not I'm not ready well but on the matter of more work actually is something that requires a different skill set but I think that you'll be well suited to it particularly you Sebastian and I think that your friends will come in handy with this one are you interested always okay we have nowhere else to be except apparently going to check out the hooded lanterns but I'm in that's not important I like getting paid yeah yeah there she's one of the hooded lanterns seemingly I don't know be color our friend but yes okay she was a prisoner and now she's kind of like a she's like our tent put her up her I haven't had a proper how do I say this servant in a while so it's a kind of a nice survivor I can reduce done just watch out for them they're still trying to collect taxes on people in the city I've heard so if you have all that much gold you might want to keep it say for you're bound to lose 10% of it have to give her my fish in taxes listen the hooded lanterns are crazy they're clinging on there they're like oh I like a poor damn dog trying to protect the quarry or the corpse of their dead owner hmm yeah and I hear you're supposed to kick the corpses it's traditional I'm learning a lot and I have like a I'm have a guide book that I'm adding to that I'm really proud of Cluedo do you think that everybody that we pick up is your servant anybody that's yeah and I mean she's really good she put up the tent last night and she what else did you show her your servants I mean you're like more than servants but less than I mean you know I what's up hey might be crazy but they are also dangerous it's people that fight with too much honor they're kind of hard to predict in my books I'd rather deal with a bunch of crazy bandits than people that say they are still loyal to some sort of nation but that's just me in any case I do have some more work for you if you're interested definitely okay let's get down to business then shall we as you might know Sebastian Drakken Himes been home to a bunch of malfeasance Wizards who have fallen out of favor with the amethyst Academy my speciality one of them has been hiding out in Drakon hime longer than any a man named Oskar urine he had a falling-out with the guild about 12 years ago and we thought he was dead to be perfectly honest but it turns out he's here alive in Drakon hime he's holed up in a mansion called read Manor up along the Market Road in the north end of the city he's survived in Drakon him for a long time and in his heyday he was a brilliant researcher he kind of left the Academy I think because he wasn't getting the funding that he wanted for his experiments so wouldn't surprise me if he's been doing some more work in Drakon hi we'd like an update on his research progress smash it all ideally no no I read that totally wrong she laughs and says what was the last time you read a book hmm how how many pages in a book I read I read this walls all the time don't worry I'm not asking you to read his research but if you can get it and bring it back to me be more than happy to read it for you mm question River how burnt do you require Oscar to be listen the only value oscar has to the Academy now he's what he knows we have no intention of bringing back him back into the fold and from what my higher-ups tell me he's not coming back no matter what but he still might know something whether it's about the delirium the other groups here he's a good researcher well give him credit for that anything he might have is worth it to us so if you want another bag of gold like the last one find out what he knows if you have to kill him fine but he's probably got a lot of information in his head so if you do have to kill him bring you his head bring that back noted just is it you guys can do that we have ways of making people talk neat even if it's just their head to loosen his lips before you have to separate his head from its body that'll make life a lot easier on we would rather you not bring him in alive ville to us so whatever end if you do have to decide that he's not worth killing it would be ideal if he didn't know it was us we'd rather if you do kill him make it look like he pissed off the wrong people not us what's his business and Jack and I'm he's selling or that does it just do research and Wellman's we found out about this lead because we'd heard that there were some there have been a few people selling potions and supplies in the city itself which is insane to me to think that anyone would actually want to hide out in here but it makes more sense when you it's it's him the there's a few complications that the delirium and the haze make it difficult for us to leverage all of our resources at the academy in finding and tracking down malfeasance and at this stage there's enough of them hanging out in the city that we would rather they didn't know we were onto them yet and his research has to do with the delirium and all of all of that the meteor and the shards it wouldn't surprise me if it did but if it doesn't it still might be interesting to us we have a feeling that he might be given that a few of the other Wizards that we've run into before that have hidden up in the city most of them took an interest in in the delirium but Oscar is in another is in another league himself in terms of his capability as a researcher and if he's figured anything out if anyone's figured anything out he's probably got a good shot at it wonderful any other questions no I don't think so I mean we know where he is we know what we got to do we're on it big blue cheese alrighty as I said Reid Manor is in the north area of the city outside the walls you should be able to find it pretty easily there's there's several manners in the in the area and I'm sure they own has a good enough understanding of the lay of the land that she should be able to lead you there I got this and as I said I leave the discretion of what to do with him up to you but I wouldn't burn the house down at first Sebastian I'll do my best to know if he has any okay fair enough I'll get the notes then I'll burn the house down maybe I'll try not to burn the house down how does that sound sounds good I mean you could burn the house down after you've taken the notes it's fair enough waste of a good house though that's true that's actually very true new base camp it it is interesting that he's camped out there so long if the house is in good shape it might make another good staging ground for future operations that might be a little bit more say discrete than the mill now so think about that hmm local Bluto he looked puzzled what's the matter who's gonna stay eerily quiet and just nod along alright so with that River boughs draws her her hood back up and says I'll give you a few days for this one I'll meet me back out here in a few days with whatever the results of your work are wonderful we'll be here alright see you soon be safe Pluto you seemed eerily quiet strange well we I like money and we just saved like the tax lady by the fire but we're gonna go beat up a scientist for his homework like does anyone else have any qualms with this he is a rogue wizard who betrayed the Academy at literally my job to track down evil wizards oh I'm saying is maybe we can find an arrangement that allows us to they didn't say we had to carry sodas research and and and maybe let them live that's the ideal solution yeah okay nice but I mean a jobs a job I'm gonna help I gotta help this this servant if I can't did you give me my servant then I just feel I feel like a bully right you are a bully and since when were you not into fighting I'm down with fighting it's just like I fight big monsters and beasts and I slay dragons and rap people I I feel like we're just Aaron people for the amethyst Academy now and now I feel like we're kind of doing their dirty work have you ever fought a wizard yeah yeah that's worse than a monster well so how do you think I get this dirty look we'll go but I I have my I'm struggling with my personal my it's true I mean this technically isn't in your wheelhouse but maybe I'll learn to trick or two to be able to survive in this city so uh what will get me to read manner sadly this is my entire wheelhouse this is what I do I kill wizards although we won't kill him if we don't have to but if he turns on us if you cast a spell in our direction then we cast spells in his direction well except you you cast swords in history okay with that you uh you set out as you head back down to your camp and begin packing things up Petra turns uh turns back teen says he didn't speak with your friend very long is everything okay yeah we just wanted to see how she was doing and kind of she lives in the area as well so we just wanted to kind of get a lay of the land so we used to live here but we just want to kind of know where where some good places to sightsee were eat to food is important and and sightsee she kind of sightseeing have you seen the city at night it's beautiful they're taking me on kind of a tour I'm new here and I gotta say that it's it's different this place is new to me and I've heard stories of tracking Heim but I've never been here and I gotta say I was probably a lot better in the books 15 years ago but this is neat our Torah books definitely need updating yeah there's gotta be you guys should have like I booked my tickets a long time the first place on the tour list was the rat's nest to go God grab a drink at a dive bar and that turned out great so we're gonna drop you off all right and then we're gonna go to check out some other locations in the city what you know do you have other business there yeah - whirring all right I do all right let's head back we take the Shepherd's Road hopefully we can run into the next patrol of the the lanterns and I can get out of your way sooner than next if if any of my friends run into you in the in the future just let them know that you ran into me and maybe they'll let you off easy do you guys have like a safe word like a passphrase that we can use we change those every day so I can't really say with any certainty whether any of our codes are gonna be from day to day mm-hmm but if you let them know that you know Petra Lang and maybe they'll save her yeah hey no bra like I said look it if you need shelter if you need work if you're sick of scrounging about the ruins consider it right especially you know I can tell you're all probably just looking for money and to pick over the corpse from some next place that you can find and if you're looking for something a little bit more honourable than that working with us it's the way to go mm-hmm I am yeah I mean we'll consider it but I've had my run-ins with the lanterns and they're not necessarily the Freebirds of the county so you know I think for now we'll we'll stick to what we're doing there's bigger threats than just rattling Xan this in the core of the city that's why we've closed the gates down so we really do need help on the inside there and this year brave enough to take on that many rattling you're certainly brave enough to fight the bigger monsters that are on the inside of the city we could really use you we've we've dealt with far larger all right gee I killed the troll that's amazing she as you as you had she asked you to regale her of the tale of how you kill the troll and then it was on top of me but then I got on top of it we were wrestling is that the whole story I wanted to become in like halfway through the story and he's standing on top of my brother Steve and I'm like get out of here but you know that is true Jackson and some like Steve Jackson games the creator of munchkin is your brother that's cannon fantastic so uh as Pluto regales petrol with his tales of troll slaying and his entrepreneurial exploits of the Jackson family in the board game industry dice you come you head along Shepards way until you reach the Shepherd's gate it's within about I shot of it where you can see the the large Barbican style gate with the two towers flanking it and the still flying up over the the towers of the the gatehouse are the library and the flags of Drakon Heim and you can see in the distance as you come down the street that there are still soldiers patrolling this part of the wall and the towers and and you can hear a little bit of hustle and bustle within and closer along the city streets you can see that there is actually a wooden palisade barricade that has been set up outside the city gates here it here in in the Shepherds way that the hooded lanterns are using as kind of a first line of defense and as you come up towards the the palisade Petra turns to you and says you're you're welcome to come into the barracks if you'd like oh I mean I'll go in I've got a had a Joe and Laurie I think it was Steve's birthday last time so I mean another Steve there's a lot of Steven I I mean if they're in I mean I mean if you have no other business you're welcome to stay with us for a couple days at least we've got food provisions we do have somewhere else to be able we could we could stop by and just say hey yeah maybe we can stop by on our way back we could do that too we do have a few days to complete this mission but I don't know what you guys sightseeing sightseeing right yeah we want to go sightseeing and then we'll come back here yeah it's it's not that I want to press the issue but on a day where it's not raining acid is probably a really great day to get a lot of things done all right yeah goodbye then as I mean I hope you don't get killed in the city I you do how my chest Ward's the flags in respect Petra salutes as well and she turns to head back into the city gates and as she turns towards the palisade there you can kind of hear like the horns being being sounded and as you turned to walk away in the in the city you can see that there's a few other people that rush out from the from the gates and there's there's a few other people that kind of like grab Petra and hug her and like kind of like turn up and you kind of just see her like shrug and look back towards the rest of you as you walk back into the city I turn one last time as we're leaving I'm like Petra just remember my name is Sebastian Crowe and and I saved you tell people I also look a little bit longingly at them cuz I I didn't know you know the group of them for a while but you know I also turned my back and start to walk away pretty quickly because I don't want to face that too much so let's get out of here it hurts alright I guess we're going to a manor to talk to a wizard we're gonna beat up a scientist that's literally what we're doing and I'm three of us I think you're the most likely to beat somebody odd I don't do it willing like I just want to talk to him Pluto you're you're you're in it and yeah you can get the homework without an issue that's what I do and we tell him as a dog ate it you're weird delirium duck ate the homework two backs he steals the homework yeah it's not lying I might be giving it already so you head through the the streets of Drakon hime following along the city wall there there's a roadway that leads kind of along from the the Shepherd's gate near towards the market gate and kind of passing through the the areas of the of the ruins it's the the Shepherd's gate in the markets gate are both in the northwest area of the city and they're kind of the two closest entrance ways from that from the direction that you've been got venturing into the city by the area here as before is part of the sprawl so many of the homes are quite rundown and for the most part a little more than a ruin now and so as you head further north along the city wall you can see that the hill that Drakon Heim is built on begins to rise sharply and part of the city begins to rise up over the inner part of the city rises up on a cliff as a lower part of the city continues to sprawl outwards and then as you get closer to the market way the strange thing happens in the sprawl gentrification as you move from a rather rundown area of the the sprawl the part along Market Road is a was a much more built-up part of the city and its heyday and the buildings turn into buildings of stone that were ramshackle drinking taverns and all and tenement homes become rebuilt and renovated ramshackle haha ones and this this old part of the the the city was the well if the farmers and the poor people use the Shepherd's gate to get into the city markets the wealthier people use the market gate and the roadways in this area of the city speak to that as you head up and cross the market way itself getting into the northern areas the city the below the cliffs at the north edge of Drakon Heim are several larger estates and manners these are where the nobles that couldn't afford real estate inside the city walls bought their homes and so you pass by you you head through the the areas this northern area of the city where the buildings are much more spread out as each piece of property has kind of a yard and in many cases the manor houses really bear the scars of the looting and the chaos that happened at the fall of Drakon Heim hurt me passing manor houses that have been many of which have been burnt down many which bear the obvious signs of having been broken into and thoroughly looted but eventually at the end of a longer cul-de-sac you come to the area where Reed Manor is and the manor house itself is a a moderately sized estate it's it's a as I said it's on the north side of Drakon Heim near the the market row and it is this rundown two-story manor house surrounded by a wrought iron fence the yard is completely overgrown it might have once been a beautiful garden but now it's filled with brambles and shrubs these kind of tough plants which seem to be the only thing aside from crabgrass that can grow in Drakon Heim now the the manor house itself has the well it's two stories only the western wing of the manor house actually has a second level the first appears to only be one level but all across the stone ground level of the house are these long thin windows that might have once been filled with stained glass but now most of them have been boarded over or in some cases have very obviously pieces of cloth have been strung across the windows because the glass has been long broken in and salvaged nevertheless you can see light shining from within on the first level off on the other side of the the estate yard there is a collapsed outbuilding perhaps it was once a barn or a stable maybe even servants quarters but that building made of wood has almost entirely collapsed casing around the the manor house itself it seems that there is there is a short cobblestone pathway that leads from the fences to the yard to a short set of steps with central double doors and in kind of the nested in this kind of alcove of the entranceway is a fountain which has been choked through with rain water and as the rain still falls below you can see like it's overflowing like clearly the drains of it have been clogged and there may if there are other entrances to the building it's certainly large enough that there's probably a back door around somewhere you might have to cross the fence and go into the estate to see it what will you do I have a plan all right let's hear it I feel smashing down the door because I'm already fail how good are you at sneaking into places how good is a mouse at eating cheese depends is the cheese in a trap no been relatively good ok Pluto how good are you at hitting things with a sword if things don't go well oh pretty good how good am I at talking to people your heads so I'm into this so far we need the homework we need to try to distract this wizard long enough to obtain his homework mm-hmm we need to be ready to fight our way out if it doesn't go well okay that's my thoughts the homework looks like I don't but research I'm imagining just looks like a bunch of papers strewn about a research looking room I'm sure it will work itself out once we're in there I think I have an idea okay okay Vail mm-hmm first floor is lit up second floor is not correct the second floor does not appear to be illuminated you go in through the second floor then you Sebastian you panic knock on the door and ask and tell them that someone's coming after you and you need somewhere to hide and then I show up and I'm looking for you the old the old the old deceived trigger it's like if they if they decide that I'm like in need of help will they not just then try to kill you I mean my thought was we're gonna knock on their door and I'm going to pretend to be the potions investigator [Laughter] and I'm it over so I heard that they have the best potions and I'm here to look into that and it seemed much better in my head when I thought of it you do have a big bag of gold which I can show to them to say how much I've been paid as a potion investigator or you could buy acid my potion is much more sense salary look at money I make it and they're like I should do that and you guys just start talking about potions investigating yeah you know here's how much I make and he'll be like oh that's cool okay I'll stand there you can back up my story every time I say something you say yes that's true be his bodyguard because you look big and tough and he's got all the gold so you're protecting him in this deep dark strange scary City I'm gonna believe that I'm person is royal as a man it's gonna be a bodyguard I mean currently you're covered in mud you're covering acid and rats okay what are we gonna do potions investigator or help me help me and then I show up fire I guess we let veo decide which one's the better plant fire okay keep it next time we do the other are you sure you don't want me to do is help it's good help okay wait if things go wrong I'll switch throw them at you I'll throw you at them sorry I'll just turn and see you and say whoa who is this guy I'm being chased that might not work as long as you guys keep it up distraction which it sounds like you can away from me getting the homework then we're good keep him at the front door let's track them long enough to let you have an entrance into the top floor you look for anything that looks like investigative notes and you get out of there before you're caught do I take the notes yes oh you take everything it's not treat mental pictures no you steal a spike in your eyeball can I do that do I know know I can't like buggy's place later when we play shadow run we'll just put a bunch of bugs in there so let's summarize Sebastian and Pluto will go up to the front door mm-hmm and knock in a friendly manner and asking to purchase potions mm-hmm meanwhile veo will sneak up the second storey and start looking around what's your exit strategy if fail gets everything and comes out she can probably pop around the side of the house and just wave to us if things go wrong I'll start a fire and signal and do you have like a can you what's your cure signal Baio what's like your ideal signal yell about pork chops we chops it means like abandon they need to get out of there okay and if you yell no wait a few yell pork chops everything's out the window because they'll know you're in the house okay well y'all pork chops of things don't know can you can you make like a bird sound yeah okay it's like mission accomplished yes pork chops is we are fair we cannot fail but we go to plan B which is fight our way through it and we'll try to keep him alive now I got a question is there any reason why we may have to come back here and deal with him again maybe we'll come back to my potions from him for real I'm just thinking like I can disguise myself so that way if I get caught there might be a reason why I need to come back so that way I can come back as myself hmm or do you think not even bother I think that we leave the disguise for if we ever need to come back here then we'll put on disguises and I will wear a must - I mean I don't want to get to Samantha key is that a word how much gold do we have you can even give us like a general idea if it's uh it is a lot you were you were paid delirium market value is worth its weight in gold okay so you've got I can tell you what I'm getting at I was thinking we kind of split it up so we bring enough that's like to buy a reasonable amount of potions you you definitely have a lot enough here that you could buy several potions so that's like let's like put like divvy it up a little bit into like a single bag like one bag of gold like a separate one that's for buying and that's okay yes if you want to separate out like because because looking in the bag most of some of them are trade bars so inside you've got actual like solid like weight to - what you got there and so there brother are gold coins as well so you can easily pull like at least 300 gold pieces out of the bag there you go yeah okay we have 300 gold yeah and that's like your your potion buying money so you can dramatically throw a bag of gold to him like either underhand or drop it on the table that kind of thing cool cuz it feels cool yeah cool so you approach the manor house the two of you walk up the cobble stone steps passing by the the fountain which is again it's collecting rain right like it's raining and as you as you see the the fountain is just like overflowing with rainwater and there's uh there's like a pair of like toads that are kind of like sitting on the edge of the fountain just kind of like creakings creaking in the rain and there's a big knocker on the middle of the left door as you walk up to the doors I gently grab the knocker and tap it lightly on the door cool the you can hear quite suddenly in within you hear the sound of what sounds like several glass bottles being knocked over in shock and what sounds like a man's voice swearing and a woman's voice who replies in kind and basically some pretty awful comments that I won't repeat out loud get repeated a bit between them that culminate in the man agreeing to answer the door as the footsteps sound and I walked towards the the door opens up will shift over to veil what are you gonna do so I am going to start to sneak around the side of the building okay looking for somewhere that I can start to climb up the side into a potential window okay you look around the back Scot it's going around the building the windows on this level are long and thin so the windows themselves are maybe four feet high but they're only about a foot thick right so well you could certainly break through the boards that are covering most of these windows that would not be quiet the second level however is another story you can see that there as UK star on the back you can see UK star on the back and there is a single door around the back and as you come around you can actually smell someone cooking something seems like there's a kitchen door here you can smell what sounds like probably like a stew or hot edge bubbling uh inside it smells good but your bar on what smells good is pretty low as you come around the second level the the on the second level the windows there are several larger windows some of them still have the glass in them but one of the windows on the second level that it looks like the glass is shattered but the window hasn't been boarded over isn't shot enough of a hole for me to potentially get through without cutting myself uh with your care and caution absolutely yes okay is there any way or easy footholds for me to actually climb to the second level the it's a rough stone house and there's several timbers and everything like that you you got about 15 feet to go to get to that that window it's a difficult climb up the stone but not an impossible one yeah there are at least several there's at least five other windows on the upper level but those ones you can see there are thick curtains drawn in front of them and the glass is still in place on those windows do I see anything that I can use as a ladder or is it just nothing in there yes there is over there's enough overgrowth on the side of the house and the stonework is is rough enough that you could climb it as it is climbing it okay give me an athletics check please is my climbing speed playing do you have a climbing speed as a taxi I do in which case then I don't even need it need a check your able o climb right up yeah so you climb up and if you place yourself on the second level of our little set up there we can actually let's uh let's show that set up our window this one yeah so yeah so you're you're at the far set so you can see the second level doesn't actually fully basically the the roofing that covers the rest of it all comes down from the second level where's the front door the front door is right there in front of us yeah where the fountain is and so you climb up along the the second level and looking in through the window you see a dark hallway it the second level is all made of wood you can see kind of you can kind of smell the smell of like dust and dirty laundry because there are several piles of disused clothing piled in what looks like this this upper room this would have once been a very nice sitting room on the second level and as you come over the window you can actually see there's a dusty staircase leading down so the window that you come in is right over a staircase leading downwards you can smell you can smell coming up from the staircase an acrid almost chemical smell but the the the room here is outfitted as a sitting room there's several broken furnitures piles of dirty laundry there's a plate of food on a table across from you and there are two large well-appointed doors leading off of this room can I see any disturbance in the dust around the staircase looking down the staircase looks well-traveled people come up and down the staircase it's just one of those stair like nasty staircases that no one has ever bothered to sweep do I see anything in terms of on the roof any bearings that I can climb across if well you've climbed up to the window if you want to climb all the way up to the roof you certainly could if you want to inside when I look up if I were to go in there are indeed rafters this is this is the upper upper level there is no attic above this although the walls continue over like continue all the way up to the middle like basically the central wall here is the middle of the the peak of the roof right and that that's like the structural thing that's keeping the roof up in the middle okay yeah but there are rafters that you could climb up into so you couldn't sneak into another room through the right units with the door yeah okay doors okay I'm gonna go in the window as quietly as I can I try to be as kinky as possible but I want to grab onto the rafters and at least hide as much as I can in there for now until I figure out a way to silently figure out how to deal with this floor because I'm assuming there's a bit of a creak to it okay it's at this moment that you hear some footsteps coming from down below and this is about the moment when you hear these two knock on the door and you hear the breaking glass came from the room beneath you from downstairs and the two people arguing back and forth were in that room and they though you hear the set of footsteps moving on the floorboards below that thump thump thump thump thump and you can hear another door open up and then Sebastien and Ludo we move back to you as the main doors open up and a wiry man in a beige coat in a beige jerkin in and kind of his hair like grease back with like pigs fat and he's kind and he's kind of got like a five o'clock shadow to him and he and he looks like someone that probably hasn't slept properly in a couple weeks or doesn't take a normal sleeping schedule because he answers the door and he says what are you doing here hello sir my name's Sebastian Crowe and you might be Marko what do you want oh there must have been some mistake I I heard that there was an exquisite potion seller in the area do you happen to know you're here to do business yeah yeah yeah yeah duh you're you're in the right place we got your car you're looking to buy I was looking for somebody by the name of Oscar that's the name I was given yeah yeah Oscar's the one that makes most of the potions yeah is he home he's working if you want to buy potions you can buy from me it's it's raining outside would you mind if we came in and maybe do you have a place that we can sit down and discuss it's one of you he's he's my escort he's here just it's a very dangerous city you understand I'm silent with my armies you understand all right he turns and he he he closes the he says give me one moment he closes the door and you hear a voice and save it stay within gamma we got customers and Turk then opens the door back up again and over the to double doors as he opens the doors up you see in front of you a Foyet it's a it would have once been a well appointed for yeh but now there are leaves and mud all tracked in the hallways whoever's taking over this place doesn't bother cleaning it all there are several barrels and boxes in here some of them are really nicely packed and what you can actually see is that several of them bear the seal that you recognize from the hooded lanterns on it and they're all stacked quite neatly up here they look like crates of just everyday civilians and supplies sitting beside them stacking them up is a massive ogre he is all of his hair has fallen out and his skin is gray and you can see there are a bunch of scars and wounds all over him but he's there like stacking up and as he turns to regard you he turns around and his eyes are completely milky and his jaw has fallen off and your name is Marco Marco turns him don't talk to the zombie and he says come on in okay oh yeah follow I follow and so he leads you to the right opening up another set of doors and so we will now kind of place you in here that did that did okay zombie ogre so he leads you through the doors to the right into a Great Hall you can see a warm fire burns in the large fireplace it's crackling flames send like the smell of amber wood smoke throughout the whole room you can see that there's a black marble mantel place like this would have been a really nice dining room in its heyday and you can actually see that there's a framed family portrait over the mantelpiece but someone has torn out all the faces and then put them on other bodies is that art there are illuminating this rumor a pair of iron chandeliers that hang off the the mahogany woodwork overhead you can see the ceilings and the rafters there's a there's a mahogany table in the center which is just covered in dirty dishes and what looks like last night's dinner and as Marco leads you into the room he kind of like sweeps a bunch of the plates off the table onto the floor with a crash turns one of the chairs around to offer you to sit down to it like funk sit down and sits down in the in the chair and kind of gestures for you to sit down you can see that like all the other cabinets in this room like have collections of like broken plates and like broken plates ruined books there's a few intact pieces that are on the cabinets but most of it is long destroyed you can smell something in the kitchen the next room over that's cooking and as he sits down he says a brain-dead clean that up and a door opens from the kitchen and another zombie comes out with a dustpan and starts picking up the the ruined glasses on the floor and take and slowly takes it back into into the kitchen and he kind of looks back up at you and says what are you looking for you looking for healing something a little bit fancier we're working on a few new things your name again sorry was Marco Marco I'm I'm a pretty high stakes person here I I'm looking for something a little bit better than the average potion manservant place my gold upon the table to show him what we're dealing with Oh oh it hurts you placed the gold down on the table with a loud thud and he leans forward and we'll move back to the [Laughter] so Val you're able to hear the rest of the conversation downstairs in you just hear the words from downstairs don't talk to the zombie as the door is closed and you can hear someone else kind of downstairs below you kind of cleaning out some of the glasses and and it sounds like she might be singing to herself downstairs she's kind of singing a body tune of some kind as you can kind of hear the the the tingling of glass and the mixing and you can hear the bubbling of something below it sounds like it's bubbling stew but it's too accurate smelling to be s - yeah it's not stew I'm gonna eat glory I mean actually be honest but that's not my mission right now focus focus so I want to still try to sneak through the window and make my way towards the door now how how tall are the rafters in comparison to the door the doors are standard door height so they're they're roughly 7 feet tall and then the roof is 15 feet at the highest point okay um I try to get up to the rafters and what I want to try to do is tie rope to the rafter shirt slide down and try to push it impossible okay so that's cool so you mission impossible the door which door this the one closest to you so you mission impossible down down don't want to touch the ground because I can just see that it's an old creaky house and I know as soon as I step down okay so yeah I lower yourself down and you twist to kind of turn turn the doorknob and push the door open yes revealing and the smell of human sweat and an untied chamberpot as you open the doors into this disgusting bedroom there are two beds in here both of them look well slept in and like they have never been well they haven't been washed or the sheets haven't been changed in 15 years they look like they would have once been really really comfortable but like the mattress has like a clear sag to it and like this pillows are covered in sweat and there's two large chests in front of each in front of each bed and what looked like the ruins and remnants it's kind of pushed in one corner of several children's toys but and then there's the two windows leading into this room and there's lamps on the bed stands beside each bed for now I'm gonna close this room because I happen to not see any papers and I back up the rope and I do the same thing with the second door still looking for all that homework boom boom that I'm expecting to see the second door is locked crap hmm I don't have any tools I'm like shiitake mushrooms need to get this door open um mess kid you could agree you could make shift something together with what you have but you don't have a proper set of these tools so if you you can try but you'll do so with this advantage okay I'm gonna try anyways because I might as well be up here and do my best okay so what am i rolling you're gonna roll give me a dexterity check with this advantage I get a nine get a nine okay so you you mess around with the the lock and as you're like pulling around with it you break the doorknob off and it falls on the ground with a loud but you know if I can I'm gonna try to now climb towards the roof to get out of the way okay as scared cap yeah you see here hoist go what was that and the boy she you you hear a set of footsteps coming up the stairs you're on the roof now you want to go in the way I would get out that would go out the window and you leap up the roof okay so you're going for the window they're going to start coming up the stairs so give me an acrobatics check to see if you can pound out the window and up onto the roof before they get to the staircase 14 so as you get to the window you are on the windowsill and you look down the stairs and this bedraggled looking rather pudgy woman is at the bottom of the stairs and you make direct eye contact and she looks and she's wearing all black like she's wearing she's kind of wearing like black leathers and she's got these this bedraggled hair that she's tied back up in a ponytail and she's wearing a big thick pair of goggles that she's pulled up back over her face and she looks you in the eyes and she says hey what are you doing thief and as you what do you do I mean your food was delicious that was on here thank you anyways bye okay so you leap up onto the onto the roof okay and as you do so we're gonna turn you you hear the screaming through the hallways you the two of you hear the this screaming of the thief thief coming down the hallways and Marco kind of perks up a little bit and says sounds like we've got some trouble we gonna I better check this out and he he kind of eyes both of you suspiciously for for a very quick moment what do you do I push the chair back that I'm sitting in and I was like thieves here that's that's ridiculous we're in Drakon hein this place is safe right I go really I coughed out my leash there were thieves on the way it might be the same ones the thieves that were after my gold because I'm so wealthy it's all that money you made potion inspecting I mean I'm a potions inspector as a matter of fact and this that's how I make my living you see you could be a potions inspector too okay make it make a deception check with disadvantage 1818 don't feed me that kind of elaborate the potions Inspection Agency died with his kingdom I'm trying to raise it back up again at this stage I'm gonna have all your roll initiative oh no it went well it went well and then what I I think will do is will this is a perfect moment though for us to take a ten-minute break yeah so we hate to leave you all in suspense but we're gonna take 10 minutes refill our water and then get back in with some serious action oh yeah and we are back we have rolled for initiative as we get into a very tense situation before the break veo had been detected by one of the inhabitants of the reed manner and though sebastian tried to defuse the situation by saying they were potion inspectors it seems the situation has escalated as marco turns to you and says you just sit right down I'm gonna go check the situation out and he her and as he opens the door to the to the room he turns to the zombie and says keep an eye on these two you can't leave us here I'm a customer I'm paying we'll get your money in a moment okay as we flip back to veo now you're standing in the window but Gemma the halfling woman at the bottom of the stairs looks at you and sees you going for the window and she fires a ray of frost towards you getting a 19-2 hits yeah okay you're gonna take five points of cold damage and your speed is reduced by ten feet get back here you mangy little cat that's called skin you alive and make a coat out of you now though it's your turn what are you gonna do she gamma as she fire fires that she's uh you can hear this other set of footsteps that are lurching towards the staircase and gamma kind of is is rake down at the bottom of the stairs I turn around say that's no way to treat a guest and I take my bow out and I take a shot at thirteen thirteen as your as your arrows screams down the stair stairs towards her she raises her hand and a glimmering shield appears in front of it and blocks the shot I take my second attack okay what the heck I already fired once Ted the the second one is deflected off of the shield as well although she probably didn't need it in that case and she she grits her teeth and she says get back here I'll find you and I run away okay so you're gonna where are you gonna go out the window and I want to drop down onto the street or onto the roof you know I'm gonna go up to the roof okay give me an acrobatics check okay as you clamor out the window your leg catches on a piece of glass your your cloak tears and you stumble out the window and start to fall give me a dexterity saving throw to catch yourself on on the windowsill twenty-three okay so you are hanging out the window sill by by your claws dangling there in place okay tough spot hopefully cats always land on their feet okay so moving from veo we go to Marco who starts leaving the room and opens the next he moves into the foyer and Kelly would you pull that level off for me the second level Yeah right cool and none of you can see it's the end of this but we'll put gamma at the bottom of the stairs put our little zombie beside her and we have one more zombie coming out of the kitchen okay so uh Marco opens the door and you hear him shouting to gamma-gamma what's going on and she says there's a cap up on the second level I heard of trying to ruffle around in things up there I but I think she's hanging by the window and he he he turns and says no need to bother Oscar let's handle this quickly and you you see him we have cast a spell and all of a sudden several copies of him appear beside him beside beside Marco as a mirror image mirror images of himself appear and he starts moving more and he that's all his movement for the turn he's in the doorway but you can see that he's ready to like fight it out so Pluto what will you do so uh the big ogre is he blocking the doorway looking our way he's looking at you he's been told to look at you guys okay this is what you were born for I I don't agree with animal abuse and I run at the and I just want to just tackle them into the for yay opening the door up for opening the doorway up for Sebastian okay so you rush in in through the doorway to tackle the over the the ground you want to shove is that what you want to do to it whatever you just want I want to shove them okay running shove give me a strength check I didn't do too well either eleven I got a ten yes so despite neither neither you nor these zombie ogre making a particularly impressive show of strength it's kind of like turn what would normally be a football tackle into kind of like a rather pathetic pulley each other to the ground and do you want to knock the ogre prone or do you want to push him five feet I want to knock comprehend the zombie collapses to the ground with it with with a lurch and Marco turns around it's like what are you doing are you in league with the thief and what would you like to do anything else with your turn no okay so we have a pro no ger and Sebastian you are up next so now that Pluto has tackled the ogre and they've both fallen to the ground I step ludos still standing okay yeah well then I step right behind Pluto okay and I say to Marco it seems you've found yourself in a rather sticky situation and then I cast Webb on him okay so you're gonna web up basically your web is gonna go in the entire Phi a and it's gonna hit him and yogurt both of them fail their dexterity saving throws wonderful and are ensnared in the webbing they are restrained I believe I creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a strength check against yeah it's restrained it can break out but yeah it's stuck there for a bit okay they're flammable they are flammable they are indeed flammable and they are difficult terrain and they so all this massive sticky webs appears in the foyer basically engulfing the entire 48 we've got one of our fun templates too so yeah we'll just fill that hole yeah yeah just full of webbing and the the ogre is restrained in it and so is is Marco so we will actually move to the zombie ogre who is restrained in the webbing knocked prone it doesn't really have the presence of mind to try to like break out of the webbing like it struggles and it like swipes haphazardly towards you at you pollute oh but it does so with disadvantage getting a big old ten to hit your AC as it's meaty fist just kind of swipes out at your legs and you step basically yeah wave it I'm gonna repost okay and I'm gonna just as he's swinging at me I'm just gonna jam my sword right into him alright do it to it do I get a advance to hit yeah yeah that is a solid the ogre on the ground is like hitting the broadside of a barn yes or kicking a dead horse for that matter 412 damage nice so you shave off a meaty part of its flesh and it falls to the ground as you know like most most corpses don't decay in Drakon Heim so there's no no telling how old this zombified corpse is if it weren't really for the fact that like the blood is kind of settled in its feet you wouldn't really know that it was dead and the wounds obviously okay so we also have a pair of zombies acting in our initiative and one of the the zombies in the the room it shuffles into the room and kind of begins moving up behind you Sebastian but it needs to spend all of its movement this turn to get just right up to you so it kind of like lurches towards you falteringly and like it's going to try to strangle you the the other zombie tries to walk up the the stairs and in fact it has such a problem like it's like climbing up the stairs so it doesn't really make any much progress as to some seemingly way might be too steep for the zombie but it tries to play with gamma and she she turns around and she sees all this unfolding in front of her and she's she is shocked and she's like she turns to gamma she turns to Mark Emma turns to Marco seeing him in snared yeah in the webs she she turns around and she eyes you Sebastian through the through through the webbing and she's she's like you're not gonna get get out of this one and she fires magic missiles at you and the three missiles Karine unerringly through the webbing and strike you Sebastian for a total of ten points of damage I cast shield so as they're flying at me I throw my hand up and a glimmering the same glimmering force field appears in front of me and I stare back at her and I go that was pathetic Wow very well played because that would have otherwise been three concentration jacks so she grits her her teeth and and dives behind the pillar slightly out of in the middle of the room slightly out of sight we now go to veo you're dangling from the roof from the from the ledge you wouldn't take it would only take a little bit of strength to pull yourself back up into the window or you could drop down at this point if I pull myself up do I get a certain amount of movement afterwards yeah I'm gonna say you're effectively prone so any you'll lose half your movement recovering from this position okay I'm gonna pull myself up okay through the window mm-hmm because while this commotion is happening I'm gonna try to sneak into the locked bedroom that is now unlocked okay the lock bet to make sure that before you you go ahead you broke the doorknob off you didn't necessarily open it I'm gonna try to kick the door in okay so you guys use get into the end of the hallway rush forward to the bedroom and you're gonna kick the door down give me a strength check with uncommon strength you bash down the door sending it flying off of its hinges into a rather well-appointed room which has a it's a master bedroom and it's slightly cleaner than the rest of the place but it still looks very very lived in probably cleaner than my there is a large bed with two side tables and several lamps and there is a large chest of drawers in the center in front of the bed of the bed and a few other accoutrements and and some old pieces of art and statues that are adorning shelves on the walls but otherwise it's pretty looks like most of the valuables that were once part of this house have been cleaned out there's a broken mirror in the corner as well what would you like to do do I see any papers or any drawers that I could open there is a chest of your there's a chest of drawers at the end of the bed I want to dry how much movement I have made so far well you've definitely used up you lost half your movement from getting getting out from from prone if you're activating your tabac see double speed ability I'm going to use you're basically in the center of the room but all your movement is spent but you still have your action I'm going to ready my crossbow if I see anybody come towards the door okay sounds good nice nice go up next to Marco who is entangled in the webs and you can see his various duplicate images all entangled like all trying to scramble out and working he is going to attempt to clamor his way out of the of the webbing and he actually manages to rip himself free and he stumbles out and he stumbles out the other side of the webbing this way yeah Pluto it is your turn am I in the webbing no it's it's been created right in front of you okay yeah and behind me is Sebastian and there's a zombie behind Sebastian and then there's the zombie in front of you that's in the webbing oh yeah the ogre yeah let's just keep this do it to it let's get this over it's given another big old wallop nice I just drive my sword into him for a 22 a zombie for 11 damage okay you're taking chunks off of its flesh but this creature is enduring an unholy amount of punishment oh I know it's a zombie creature ah it's good for me I'm just gonna stand in that doorway Sebastian so I imagine that I start to create a small flame in my hand but then I look over and is this the same room that those crates are in yes and are they in the webbing yes so creating a fire would burn them yes I put the fire out in my hand and I'm going to hmm I have way too many fire spells it seems there's a zombie coming up behind me yes there until me yeah he's not near any crates no I turn around and I'm like hello zombie and I burning hands okay you burning hands the singular zombie yes okay he fails his dexterity check saving throws spectacularly oh and his engulfed in flames oh that's uh that's freaking great that's a sixteen sixteen fear damage sixteen fire yeah zombie is nearly a limit I'm elated as large chunks of flesh are seared off of its bones but just enough of it remains that it still is animate and like these charred fleshy muscle bits and bones continue to lurch toward you that seems worse is the zombies aren't right next to me at is about ten feet away from you okay I'm going to move into the room betwixt the webbing and pollute oh okay I wedge myself into the corner out to put Pluto between me and my enemies sounds good the zombie the zombie over again continues to swipe at pollute Oh with disadvantage ineffectually it's like it's so respite tied up in the webbing and it just doesn't have the presence of mind to try to break itself free it just continues to swipe at you the other zombies however the the first zombie seeing a struggle going on it lurches towards Pluto as well kind of following Sebastian and it kind of moves forward Sebastian gets that is out of the way so it just goes right for you Pluto and it gets a 19-2 hit that's a hit sorry I accept the charge zombie more points of bludgeoning damage as it brings its two hands together and smashes you in the face and it hits you right in the nose oh the other zombie clamors towards the the mess in the center and it's just right up on the border of the web it looks like it's going to in in the end an effort to try to attack you all it might try to walk into the West look at all zombies so that leads us back to the top with Gemma who turning around in in this situation she turns around through the the pillar and fires array of frost towards polluted eyes she can through the webbing because the webbing is really obscuring obscuring I'm gonna give you partial cover no that'll be a plus to bonus tier okay she's looking for 20 which I get a 20 yeah roll high she found it five points of cold damage okay as she fires the ray of frost through through the webbing sending some of the strands kind of covering them with a thick thin rime and it strikes you and as as you're kind of caught on two sides between the two zombies zombies everywhere valence we're gonna be over to you I you can hear all the commotion downstairs and the shouting from your companions but you're still up here and no one doesn't seem like anyone's come for you I'm gonna make haste and zipper strike okay so that way I can with the speed of the wind tear through this room to see if I can find those any sort of papers whatsoever so I look at that chest at the end of the bed and I'm so well opening the chest will be your interaction yep for the round kick the chest open and it's about eight pairs of shoes men's shoes and several pairs of pants that don't look like they've been washed in a while it's all clothing in the chest actually some of them are really nice I say you know what I'll take the nicest pair of shoes in there and I then use my movement to get out okay and dive through the window okay as you as you do you hear a jingling and a nice pair of shoes and you see inside as you as you go to dive out the window there's actually a set of keys inside the shoe I'm gonna keep both of these and I wonder if there's anything in that room that required a key to open I want to go back in the room and see if there's anything into the hallway there's just this is somebody's bedroom and but all they had here was a set of keys in here like there's there's a few odds and ends that it looks like they're like looking on the bed stand there's there's a book that looks like it's kind of like a trashy fantasy novel of some kind on there and like an extra pair of reading glasses but both of these look like just bedrooms hmm so know nothing to unlock I think I used up all my movement so yeah I'll give you the movement out because you kind of like you wanted the more information about the room so if you want to move out that that's okay we'll say you kind of found the keys and you look around really quick okay where do you want to move to I want to dive out the window okay yeah you do that you dive out the window cool you're out back on the estate having dov'è at the window are you driving out the bedroom window or the window that you were going at going out before the window was going up okay okay so you dive out on land land easily back on your feet that's deep land on their feet are you distracted playing with it like in the street we we now go to to Marco who seeing seeing this the situation really escalate pulls his magic together and can you you see a bit of necrotic energy collect around his hands as he fires a ray of sickness at pollute oh I don't know which goes completely wide landing with a vicious acidic and poisonous glob on the wall behind you yikes and we move now to pollute oh all right what would it look like for me to get I wanna man I want to try to get through this webbing but people who taking potshots at his wedding webbing I'm just gonna I'm gonna finish this over I'm not gonna overthink it cool I'm gonna recommend doing a nine more damage so you slam your blade down on the on the ogre it's severely wounded it's definitely like bloodied but it's still like thrashing ah yep okay and I just stand my ground okay stand your ground Sebastian we're over to you there's still the zombie in the room with me right no cuz you've moved into the foyer the zombies caught in the doorways right has caught with Pluto there's one of me there's one of my feet and then there's two majors in the other room yeah just just a quick question at some point in this battle somebody yelled out the name Oscar yes who were they directing that at they were it was Marco directing it at gamma so gamma he called her Oscar no he said there's no your your your recollection is a little bit hazy there but I'm gonna leave you with it oh darn somebody's all scared no I heard Oscar did yeah somebody's Oscars Oscars here somewhere he's a zombie maybe so I can see Marco through the doors there's still multiple of them yes damn I'm going to cast scorching ray okay at him at Marco through the webbing well I like is the webbing on the ground or is the webbing the webbings through through I'll say that it he's in the doorway he's not quite there I'm gonna say that you got a straight enough shot that there's there's no chance of you igniting the webs wonderful so scorching ray first shot is the natural one my second shot ooh that's better 23 okay let's resolve it it hits him it hits the real him you think let's roll the damage eight damage so it actually strikes him soundly in in the chest and he collapses and passes and it looks like it might have killed him oh so so I shoot first and it goes wide and I was like that was a warning shot this is another and then I shoot him again and he just falls over and I'm like oh I have a third third shot right yeah you could aim it at the zombie zombie or the others on at the actually I'm like okay and then I turned to the zombie that's fighting Pluto okay yeah my third shot that's a 12 that hits that's all we needed this is the 112 to have a cheese obliterated and it's the pieces of the zombie are our fly in many different directions yeah it's undead fortitude doesn't save it overpass oh yeah everywhere all inside just love doing alrighty we moved to the zombie ogre who tries another desperate strike at Pluto which is still going nowhere it's it's thoroughly trap I'm gonna repost it oh my god and I oh yeah I get 14 damage plus 20 damage 20 damage 220 damage on a 24 hit it's like that fortitude doesn't you behead the zombie ogre yes and it's its head still kind of going a little bit but that's that's the end of it like when he's swiping at me I'm like half paying attention and every time he takes a swipe I just swing my sword down at him cool the last zombie clamors into the webbing and is restrained by yes okay gather seeing the situation turning really badly against me you see a shadow mark oh no and she runs across the room to the doorway at the base of the stairs and produces a set of keys from inside her cloak and she starts fumbling with him opening the the doorway and she gets it open and rushes into the next room Vail you're up I start to rush around the side of the house to a window to see if I can view inside I want to go to the back of the front choice North North is that way so north okay just to see the first window so you go up the arched windows around the back these are these are larger windows back here this one actually isn't quite as boarded up as the other ones and you can actually see as you come around gamma opening the door and she you make eye contact again and I the window guys take the shot 19 that hits she won't be able to block that with her shield and 11 points of damage that will slay her what how does it happen can i I want to hit her in a non-lethal spot if possible or is that gonna kill me that with the range weapon shoot her in the knees gonna get her in the knee yeah sure so you you you hit her right in the knee if you screams out in pain collapses to the ground gasping it and kind of does it on the ground eyes but she is bleeding profusely and will die quickly without medical attention because the blood loss probably potentially like it seems like you've hit like a major artery cuz that amount of damage for her amount of hit points yeah she's she's gonna go go out pretty quick it is Marko's to turn whoo moaning on the ground as he's taking his last breath Pluto you're up buddy I'm going to chase after Gemma okay so I'm gonna make my way through the web all right you need a strength saving throw buddy seventeen that passes my decease so it takes all your movement to get to the other side of the web but you're through it smoke the zombie that's in the doorway oh he's restrained right yeah do I guess he's in the webbing do I get advantage yeah what didn't help but 14 yeah four 10 damage cool you want to continue forward like if I can use like I want to get up to him and just hit him and then if I can get past them but you can and I'll say this point was Sebastian going next the two of you are able to make short work of the zombie and you'll be able to to to I'll catch up together in the the next room so you wanted to dismiss your webbing yeah I'll just miss the webbing after I muscled my way through and I'm covered and I step into the room and I kind of kick gamma over so she's facing up and I looked down at her and I say you used to be an adventurer until you took an arrow in the knee so you passed through two rooms in the process now that you have time to actually take stock of your surroundings this large room here looks like it was once the parlor there are several old bearskin rugs and several animal heads that have been hung in trophies throughout this room but all the animal trophies have been have a second life now as coat racks or have like clothing hanging up to dry on their antlers and several large tables have been set up in here the remaining furniture has been pushed to the side of the room because this whole room been turned into a makeshift alchemical lab and several Olympics and alchemical materials are all laid out on the tables here and a large cauldron burns in the oven here filling the room with the acrid smell and there's a few books that are open on the table with that appear to have all chemical instructions in them and and a few other things have been disturbed in here there's looks like the remains of several meals and a few other things here the room that gamma is bleeding out in however is very moldy smelling because it's filled with books there's several there's a large mahogany desk in the middle of the room between the arched windows and it's covered in crumpled paper and open books and there's this kind of torn up leather chair up against the desk the whole of the rest of the walls are lined with bookshelves and one of the sets of bookshelves though to the east side instead of being covered in books is covered in the statues of small collectibles of various fantastic creatures the the books do not appear to be very well kept in here many of them are definitely smell like they're molding and there there's even books strewn all over those floors but there's a pathway that there's a clear pathway in the floor of the room that leads towards the desk but also towards the furthest most bookshelf yes yeah I think you've all gathered together and gamma is like screaming and waiting it I want to tie yelling obscenities at you all on a tie off gammas leg with a rope okay she'll live law and Intel like it'll starch the bleeding she'll live for now and I say if you want me to keep this rope on here you're gonna tell us a couple things she said she she kind of spits up some blood and says what are you here to rob us I mean yes where's Oscar he's working working where I want to get you would you like to make an intimidation check I get a 12 in his lab where is this lab see this can be easier this can be hard you're going to die or we can try to help you live I'm looking for Oscar I have no business with you I want to go grab Marco cool and I'm gonna bring him in to the room okay how dead is he very recently I'm going to there's a large burned hole where his chest was I'm gonna look on the shelf for a potion I'm not too concerned which one it is and I'm gonna say here feed this to her yeah there's a few finished potions on the desk I'm gonna say there's a there's two finished potions in with the alchemical equipment they haven't been labeled yet what if it's a healing potion or like a potion that makes her invisible or like something we'll see what happens here give her this thing I don't know man pull the rope tighter she screams so just tell us where the laboratory is she looks she sighs you let me live right yes I wouldn't be tying your leg up if I wasn't gonna let you live you could just make this a lot easier and less painful on yourself if you just tell us where it is statue of the dragon on the Shelf rub its belly I I go over and I look back at you guys do it do I do it do it okay do it with your right you do with the hand can't you do with your weird hand oh yeah I step back and I cast mage hand and it rubs the Dragons belly there's a small click as the the dragon kind of looks like it it is giggling it moves a little bit and the bookshelf slides out revealing a secret dusty rooms with a large hatch in the middle which has a lock in the center we'll never get through a locked door she kind of looks just hurting she's like I didn't know he kept an extra set of keys yeah well we have them thanks for the advice we should probably keep her alive anyway I open the door just like you're gonna let me go now right in a minute and I start to drag her in the rope actually sorry here let me help you up I do help her up so that way she from limb okay the wizard yeah I opened the door okay there's a ladder leading down about 15 feet to the building's foundations to a dusky torch-lit room I yelled down the ladder Oscar were the potion investigators we're here to do business you hear a voice shortly afterwards come up from within and he you know say ideas this is low like blustery voices and he swears a few obscenities and says Marco I told you to stop messing around while I'm working leave me be how did you get through the locks my name's Sebastian Crowe and I'm here to do business with you a moment passes says whereas Marco comes the voice there was an unfortunate incident incident where is gamma she's here poker and gonna say hi I poked her in the leg she screams she's here [Music] [Music] you up there I don't know who you are are you with spells do you have weapons all of the above he kind of uttered he swears under his breath you can hear it he he calls back up from the echoing below what do you want we hear that you're doing some interesting research and I myself am interested in the ongoings of track and I'm involving delirium and the meteor and I understand that you were the person to talk to I came to do business with you your employees were not very forthcoming with the information I desired and then they attacked us and we retaliated and now here we are all right make a deception check cuz it kind of went south on both ends I know oh no oh dear that was a seven sounds to me like you were roughing up my apprentices that's one way to put it [Music] no-no-no give anything that I want to uh I'm gonna throw Marco dragged him to the edge and I just I just toss him in and I and I and I yell into the pit now listen up you you scientist I don't wanna we're after your homework and I don't want any trouble it's just I don't want to have to do to you with this when I what we had to do this wizard this is not the initial intent we came in here wanting to talk slash sneak around but talk nonetheless that's true right now come on white hockey you can come down here you can come up here no you want information you can come down are you going to kill me as I come down I haven't decided yet but I'm sure you haven't figured out you're thinking about the same thing I want to grab the two potions okay and I Gemma I want to turn to Gemma I go what did these do she says poison no she's lying through her teeth yeah how dark is it like if I descend the language black I want to use minor illusion to make the sound of somebody going down this the ladder and dropping along to the platform okay and then can i minor illusion my voice yep so I want to do that so that it sounds like I go down the ladder and into the darkness and then I want to say from the shadows okay I've come down my arms are in the air don't attack me you hear the sound of a what might be a door or a portcullis being raid or like open or raised his voice was quite muffled he was definitely talking to you from the other side of a doorway and as light and light now fills the the tunnel and you did footsteps in your voice but as the light opens up he says don't play games with me I had to check to see if there was a trap you have to understand we're both people of intelligence here fine calm down let me see you in the light if you try to kill me I'm gonna be upset and then I do climb down the ladder and drop to the platform what about the other two of you I I could have gone first but I'll I'll go second okay who's gonna I was gonna be like now that meet demands servant it's a 10 feet down 10 10 feet wide yeah I'll show y'all gonna grab the next part oh you guys want to slide that just forward yeah I'll just make Joe do at all Jeff do you need a hit I think this went well three merry adventurers killing people we just invaded a chemistry lab we just started killing everyone I mean that wasn't our intention things went poorly because feyo dropped a doorknob and I like to think that there were zombies and they were already dead and so technically I didn't kill anyone killing Marco was a complete accident I shot it I haven't killed anyone yet yet as you can you poke your leg a little more well that's a nice lab where are we right here that makes sense I is there any way that Gemma can go down the ladder with her leg as such you could push her I don't want to kill her and there's mercury club body at the bottom but I definitely want her to go first before me cuz I don't want her running off anywhere where she can get help so I make her try to go down the stairs so see if she doesn't just shuffle around some of the Dwarven forage we're gonna make it all pretty for everybody watching at home nice looks good that's okay there we go yeah scene change scene we'll figure out we'll find it we'll find a good methodology I think but the Dwarven forages terrain Trey's like for switching stuff out like this just as an aside like no marketing like thing all the all the setups are on their terrain trays and it's actually really easy for switching stuff out like this so yeah they look really good makes it work really well so you head down stairs into a rather dusty basement where a torch has been linton and a set of double doors leading to the south have opened up and a man stands in front of you he probably weighs about 350 pounds he's pretty obese and he has a long kind of coiffed hair cut and a [Music] a goatee that suggests he's trying to make himself look like a noble and he's wearing clothes like Nobles clothing that he probably found upstairs and is a little bit too small for him and you can kind of see like his belly button poking out from his shirt and he everybody's carrying a staff that he is tipped with a piece of delirium and as he he comes around in in the the darkness of down here in the in the torchlight you can actually see that his eyes are glowing purple with with the same purple glow of a shard of delirium and he kind of speak like he kind of waddles forward at you he's probably about five eight so he's a short and really wide guy and he says what did you do to Marco and Gama well gum is still alive she fell on this arrow that we that that video had you need to train your apprentices better I cast a spell at Marco as a warning and he died it was it was really quite pathetic and he's hoping for a fight buying buy some potions in any case if you didn't get them the city would have got them in another couple of weeks still it's hard to find good help out here are you looking for a new recruits not better about to hire you lot for anything we're clearly better than the last lot you hired I got plenty of help I'll figure it out mark will make a good enough servant or at least for the time being what do you want you say you came here to do business yes my potions I'm afraid I'm gonna have to mark you up quite a bit for killing one of my apprentices no I'm actually here for information that's the sort of business I'm after you see we've come to Drakon I'm looking to solve some issues that are happening around here with delirium and with the crystals and we understand that you are a great resource for research on the subject we actually heard that you were the best huh who told you that sources that we need to keep safe what sources secret sources you see there's a lot of scary people in the city there's who you've been talking to you I mean we've met up with the silver fire paladin's we've met up with the hood Atlanta in the amethyst Academy we've seen them all they all are after their own things here and we're after ours are those your zombies the mine yes okay I'm gonna just walk right up to Oscar I'm gonna grab him by the scruff of the neck okay and I'm gonna push him against the wall I go listen nerd if you don't want what happened to Marco and Gemma to happen to you you're gonna give us all your research right now yes manservant and there'll be no pricing and they'll be no there'll be no negotiation and you'll be lucky if you get out of this you you necromancer he turns back to you you best not manhandle the merchandise you're after that idiot and he points to his head most of it's all up here hmm it's not like I'm looking to publish a paper with the Academy anymore this is all about me down here you see this and he opens his eyes see what long it's taken me years to get to this point just this alone all guys it's inside his head and I pull out my sword my friends a little abrasive he kind of pushes you off for a big guy and a short guy he's surprisingly strong look I had my cool I had my doubts about beating up a scientist but this isn't some kind of pushover he's a he's delving in the dark arts he has no well I'm wondering he has no moral compass we were here to get some information but I'm wondering if paying you to continue these researches might be a better way to get more information from you at a later time rather than just wait wait wait man with what you have fish you're talking about our goal this is worth a lot especially salmon supposed to convince him to give us his research without oh you're standing right in front of them there's no place for this kind of discussion fair enough oh we're gonna I'm listening there I think if you want to continue your studies you need finances do you not I got a provider material everything I need to keep living and working here yeah but we could ruin that and go two seconds flat I don't think you could we could ruin you you pay the price for it we have ways of extracting information I'm sure you do you see those crates upstairs yeah the ones about the hood lanterns yeah who do you think's providing their potions this is a conundrum um if you you can't touch me idiots do you want to keep working in Drakon hime hood lanterns get wind that I'm I'm out of here they'll find out they'll know they'll hunt you down they're like bloody crazy bloodhounds and I'm the one keeping them alive with all my healing oceans there's got to be other sources of healing potions you can't be the only one I'm interested in your research on delirium and I'm hoping I could borrow your research just to study it and then I'll return it you want to stay here you want to work you want to earn your keep you want to place one of my apprentices how good with you with a spell book hmm you learn new spells fast all of my spells kind of just happen Oh your blasted source around I'm sorry you had to you had to study to learn your magic I can just do it so I'm gonna walk past him and I want a hearing spell I want to start looking in his his laboratory so as you walk up to him and you kind of look into the lab you see it's a it's a large chamber and the foundations of the building looks like it what a 1-point looking down you can see that this room reminds you of the personal training rooms that many Nobles in caspia might have created there's actually the the the bearings of what would have been weapon racks in here and it would have been one so a well-appointed training room you can actually see by like the the you recognise it because like a training room typically has like a would like a good floor and like the remnants of that or on the sides but now the bare stone is visible and he has several racks and surgery tables that are set up as you I threw into the room and on two of the racks are very clearly corpses but on another pair of the racks are almost certainly a the and you can tell that there are corpses on the two racks because they're splayed open they're either insides but there are two intact bodies on two of the other racks whether or not those are dead bodies or not it's difficult to tell this is Drakon Heim so they wouldn't be decayed but they are intact bodies of a male dwarf and a human man and both of them have been shaved head to toe all three of the corpses are shaved head to toe and their eyes are closed they appear to be unconscious there are several vials and syringes and bits of alchemical liquid on on shelves all throughout the room and in the center of the room is actually a pile of several coffins any features like tattoos or scars on the dwarf and the yes they are both covered in tattoos hmm right and looking them over they look like gang tattoos maybe from the blades to do who are the blades are the thieves the thief people is that what they're called the Queen of Blades queen of Thieves something's the queen of Thieves bad lady I'm not sure I'm not sure how to convince this guy to give us his research I mean Pluto I leave it in your capable hands I want to look at any delirium in the room yes there is there's several shards of delirium on one of the far shelves you can kind of notice it's faint glow but nope arch it mints like no scroll there are yeah there's there's definitely like notes and research down I mean let's just start picking it up you're just gonna walk into the room yeah he's like he turns to you he's like any as you go towards the door he grabs the door and like pulls it closed this is what are you snooping about for that's private I want to impose myself between him and the door and I just start pushing the door open I'm fighting my way through it alright he's not happy about that and he's it looks like this situation is turning aggressive a Sebastian what do you guys want to do hold on a second before we get a little bit hasty I just want to take a moment so you're supplying the potions to the yeah the hooded lantern manners are paying me and they leave me well enough alone how much are they paying you they pay me by the potions they're paying me and enough to keep my operations in here and they bring me the odd bit of delirium but how much they're paying me can you bring me delirium well I'm actually one of the best delirium finders in the city so and can you keep me protected obviously they can't do a very good job of it if you've got got this far but I don't want to not provide them with potions but I want the information so can they keep providing you with gold but can we provide you with enough money to go above and beyond with your research what do you want from my research what do you want to know hmm well there's not a lot more you who are you working for are you working for one of the other malla fans in the city is it more Dane is it Kenan who is it I don't know who these people are were just here because we all we all have our stakes in this city I I was born and raised just I'm here looking for a reason I was there I was inform do you want knowledge you don't want just power to be honest I'm more interested in the fact of why the Delirium doesn't affect me that's the kind of knowledge I'm looking for and I want to know about willing to volunteer no I've heard about it I want to look through the knowledge and see if tell you what the chains we want to tell you what I know if you let me perform a few little experiments on your cat that's out of the question what kind of experiments life-threatening I won't kill you I mean I'm not opposed to it if we can get what we want I've survived worse I don't know what that means though you could turn into something unnatural turn into something unnatural I can't promise you that I'm but if you let me if you stay with me for a few days how about this I'll give you some of my blood in exchange blood would be useful that's the payment you're looking for that's the payment I'm more than willing to give in exchange for your research one vial of Taback see blood and a hundred gold I'll give you some fur - you can play around the fur as well - maxxie blood that actually might be something interesting and I will actually not just fine oh let's entertain this maybe we can be useful to each other let's uh come into my lab and have a seat just need to ask nicely sorry my manservant he takes his some stools and fishes out from his equipment a very sharp surgical knife and a metal bowl and he turns to and he he turns to veo and I'm petting you veo and night did you try to calm you tonight it puts the bowl on you and puts the ball on your lap and says bleed and we can't start talking I take the knife and I slice my hand and I just start cool and basically as he as he talks he he holds hold your arm and like kind of coaxes the blood out into the end of the bowl and he begins speaking what are your names I'm smashed and crow right right Jackson but I want to be walking I'm gonna walk around his lab I'm gonna do like the the the nonchalant tour where while people are talking and and he's occupied with Bao's hand I'm gonna start looking at the shelves and that the parchments and stuff they owe the man is as as Oscar bleeds you you can tell that he's definitely like medically proficient but have you ever had one of those doctors that's good at their job but isn't it's still rough with you like they're precise but like he doesn't have a good bedside manner and it's just like direct about the whole thing it's pretty unpleasant and in the process of this because he's bleeding you medically as this process starts you're gonna take seven points of damage and you now have a level of exhaustion because you're effectively giving blood it tired guys but he he turns he goes to one of his shelves and rifles through a few things and pulls out a jug of milk and a hunk of bread and puts them besides start downing the milk stuffing the bread in my mouth thank you you're with one hand obviously cuz he's got it's like hold still and he says you know what I've been researching I've been trying to build up a resistance to the Hays over the past couple years I've been exposing myself to more and more delirium and it's done this to me any gestures to his eyes I can drink small amounts of it and it restores my spells now I've been looking into some of these interesting things and I think I might have something this might be very helpful your blood because a few of the many of the creatures of dragon high to back see the nobles the Minotaur's other monsters they're not affected by the haze why does it poison humans why does it cause elves to wilt like leaves it's strange thing some creatures are resistant to it some art there's also strange plants growing inside the city some in the Queen's Park Gardens where we started calling them eldritch lilies and I found that by getting one of the lilies mixing it in with some of my other fluids and imbibing it as I drank the delirium fluids it wouldn't make me quite as sick but I haven't had any of the time nor the skilled apprentices to get further into the city to collect any more or do any more research or actual field testing but I think that with a bit of blood I might be able to figure out what it is makes you resistant to the delirium and the haze and make something of it that wouldn't mean benefit me because I've always been curious about you know why why I'm resistant and everyone else isn't so this is very interesting but most importantly it restores spells you're addicted the delirium itself yes you see delirium is strange I've observed it for some time when I could it grows people think that the delirium is like a mineral or a rock but it's not it's like wood it's like a plant it grows and like any piece of wood if you chop down a tree you're not going to make any bigger plants than what that tree was makes sense that's why it needs time to grow and so I think there's bigger pieces of delirium now in the city than there were when the meteor first fell interesting do you think there's more here than when it landed yes well that's interesting this has been very helpful hmm is this basically the summary of your research it's most of what I found I its the delirium mind you it doesn't grow very fast it's taken me about a decade of observing it to watch it and I found that if you remove it from the city it doesn't grow any more it's like a fungus that needs the right kind of humidity there's something about the air here now with the haze that it only grows here that's why I've lived here for so long because I had easy access to it I've gone through my fair share of apprentices trying to try various ways of resisting it or using it so I suppose do you think there's a an immediate threat to the city that if it stays here it could eventually take it over he kind of looks at you like he's never thought about that before like yeah and he says its power will just harvest it faster have you done any research into speeding up the growth process nothing that's yielded any results sorry again about your apprentices but the next time that you hire some people you might want to tell them to be a little nicer to guests where's Gama we did tie her leg but she was bleeding out pretty bad so do you have a potion we can give her to help her out a little bit he fishes over for one of them a healing potions and and what does it look like it looks like the ones above the other ones are healing potions why would you lie to us we could have given her one okay they were loyal kids they're only useful as long as they're loyal well hopefully one of them is still alive and we can leave you with one loyal subject but I think that in the future if you ever need a little bit more to back sea blood there might be more that we can find out if you do more research if you make it deeper into the city you find any of the eldritch Lilly's bring them back to me you understand keep an eye out how did you find out about my research how did you know I was working here I mean we've been in Drakon home for a while she's been here since the collapse of the city you don't think there's whispers in the streets about the guy who's doing all the research on delirium I mean yes you have very tight-lipped group of individuals but things get out and we find those things out that's our job just keep it under wraps front you're a sorcerer so you're probably not one of the Academy boys and those wells they're scum in the Academy they get wind of what's going on here they're just gonna take everything over they're gonna it's been a good riddance that they haven't made it back into their tower too many rules and regulations with the Academy I I tried out for them once and didn't quite make the cut I like you I agree they as long as you've got the favor of the higher-ups they'll let you do anything you want but as soon as you get it you piss off the wrong people it's no good yeah you send one girl to the depths of hell and I mean it's all downhill from there you just try to practice honest necromancy raise a family in a good old-fashioned honest way and they have a huge problem with you raise a family or Risa yeah raise a family like like a ogre and a couple of heat people like humans like a family yeah thank you this has been extremely helpful and thanks for being so welcoming to us even after we pushed you against the wall murdered your apprentices one apprentice by the way we should I'm sure run up the stairs and get the potion up to Jemma okay and she she she turns she just looks at you with utter contempt she's like what is this for well I don't want you to die that wasn't the point you're trying to rob us blind it doesn't mean I want to do dead I hope you got what you wanted I respect those that can survive in the city so email make the most of this life Marko was my friend it doesn't mean he's not gonna come back did you kill him Oscar no downstairs you can talk to him afterwards all right probably won't be the last time we see you so see you soon Jemma she just like looks at you with hate like she asked ourselves all right get out of my house he come back bring me blood and delirium and I'll tell you what I've learned you wanted the Eldridge Lilly's as well yep we take our leave walk out the front door yeah all right oh yeah and your bedroom door lock is broken there scorch marks in the dining room as well sorry there's a few dead zombies that you might have to clean up one of them's chopped to pieces apologies I I took those two potions for sure but she would grab some of those supplies on the way out from the hooded lanterns I gave look if we're gonna be labeled views it's like we might as well I think we should leave them because if the hidden lanterns know either we give them to the more that we stole them like we don't want to be in their bad graces and dirty in the bank raises because we left everyone alive well see I think they know her name no the confusing part here is that we're like distance as we're walking down the street the hood lantern seemed to have given them the supplies in exchange for potions yeah so we're not in anybody's bad graces we got the information for the amethyst Academy we left him alive for the hooded lanterns we now have a deal with him to continue his research so we can learn more it's a win-win-win there's no way any of this could backfire no yeah we 100% need to go to capitate that scientists kill Jemma and and burn that place to the ground I'm some friends in the lanterns I don't want to completely devoid them of healing potions they need all they can to survive in this city we're gonna have to talk her way out of this Iran that's what I do best we talk their way into and out of this entire situation with only a little bit of murder my body pieces I honestly didn't want to hurt that guy but after I saw him I wanted to kill that guy why because he's a necromancer so my shadow things he brings them back to life what you do is natural you toys fires are natural later this is totally weird this is weird it's gonna get really weird if I stake some necromancy spells as oh yeah like that freaks me out I mean I don't I don't have control over what spells I learned they just happened so I mean I'm sorry if I raised some dead I'm just glad that I have another person that doesn't necessarily want to kill Paul doesn't wanna kill me in the city is a friend made by the way fail you've survived in the city of 15 years and what two days of knowing is you've you've I mean I won't say it was your fault that the whole thing went sideways I didn't say I was going to say and I didn't say it but I also gave my blood so that way you didn't have to kill the guy true true we did it let's think positively in the city each other as we walk we leave the door open wide open oh by the way I'm gonna continue to call you man surface I'm gonna continue to detest it well I think that that's where we'll wrap up for for tonight after some very interesting things went down that was unexpected the way that that worked but I do wanna as we wrap
