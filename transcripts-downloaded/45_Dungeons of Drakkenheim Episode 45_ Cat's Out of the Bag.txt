bathed in Elders fire Ahmed Wolf believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon hybrid cottom its rival factions struggling to rule the rumble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Dragan Haim when last we left our heroes they were far beneath the spokes the outer ruins of the city of Drakon Heim where the queen of thieves and her bandit gangs have their underground stronghold having invaded with the assistance of the rattling horde led by the rat Prince our heroes infiltrated rather forcefully a delirium mining operation happening far underground and the swarming rattling zhh have propelled our heroes deep into the chaotic midst of the queen of Thieves stronghold we're in the midst of all the chaos from the attacking hooded lanterns and Caspian Zebub the gangs are in disarray led through the underground fortress by a chance run-in with their old friend blackjack Mel our heroes were led to a pair of double doors in the midst of the under tavern the great casino underneath in the queen of Thieves fortress amidst all the disarray our heroes paused for a moment for Sebastian to activate his new goggles which he hasn't brought tonight well I mean I'm in costume of classic classic Sebastian okay so that means you can't use the goggles right no Sebastian game Sebastian's looking great great well in there okay but having said that Sebastian activated his goggles of true seeing and was able to reveal that blackjack Mel was in disguise and actually was none other than cat or Katerina von Castle after a brief exchange of very sharp words our heroes now stand in the midst of this chaos ready for what comes next what will you do ludo you're ready for this imma kill a mage tonight me too I'm gonna talk to her no you don't get to talk to her there's no diplomacy you are standing now in front of a big pair of double doors that are just to the side of a large bar in the midst of this huge underground casino whatever this room was before it doesn't look like the basement or under structure of any building that would have been up above it's too large for that in fact it almost looks like a buried palace underground here the entire room is in disarray as the various patrons have run out the stairs and the doors leaving this space entirely leaving playing cards dice a roulette table various other gambling games all in progress across scattered across all the tables although as you continue your dialogue with blackjack Mel you see that there are several others that we're running about fleeing in terror the attacks from above and below but several others now are watching are starting to stop and watch you all intently and Sebastian as you turn your gaze onto them as a few of these beings approach you you can they're your goggles pull away their skin revealing this faceless revealing their faces are in fact faceless they have just two specs instead of a nose and no mouth whatsoever and just these milk-white eyes and their skin is translucent and you can see the bone underneath their skin which is itself more like a cartilage sort of material that's translucent you can actually even see looking at like their hands they hold them up as they rest are weapons on them that there's their bones and blood veins are all visible but you can tell that you can only see this because of your goggles for veo and Pluto you just see more members of the of the Queen's men there's at least four figures that are like this that are circling about the about the room and finally as you look back upon Kat herself the the best way to describe her is that you know she has this very thick and wavy light blonde hair that is very different from the complexion of her mother and reminds you much more of the portraits of her brother and the portraits that you've seen of the old king and fur for you pollute oh it's like the same exact hair color as George right socially Jacmel yeah her her she the best way you could describe her as striking but not beautiful and her eyes regard you coldly and you can see as you look at that the illusion of black Jacmel still covers her because you can see that through your true sight but it looks like illusions are weaved upon illusions on her person because well she is wearing this tightly fitting black leather armor underneath the the illusion it looks like she's actually wearing an invisible cloak an invisible hat and an invisible amulet and all of her weapons which consist of a bunch of daggers all up the inside of her jacket and her rapier itself are all invisible as well he can see this he can see this like but you guys hurt her but both of you still say see Black Jack now [Music] we still on this channel she's got a ton of daggers she's got layers of disguises and the people watching us behind us are not people they look really weird what are they I don't like me weird or like you weird they don't I don't know what they are but I don't want to look back at them because they're freaking me out are you with us right now are you with her what do you mean are you I'm with you guys you're with us yeah what what do you mean you know what I mean I'm with you she's listen we've been dawdling here for a little bit too long if you want to talk about the next steps we can come on through step into my boardroom I'm not going in there I feel very uncomfortable about going in there we can talk right here Kat send away our minions to central air minions I don't think so I do if you want to meet privately the doors right here Kat you're running out of options here your people are fleeing the rats are coming down from below what ground do you think you have if I didn't have ground I wouldn't be standing here in front of you right now that freaks me out I'm I'm pacing behind I keep my eyes on on the for while while Sebastian's talking to black Jacmel one of them has taken it is that Sebastian identifies all of them look like they're this there they taken the roles of the server's of the casino so one is a car dealer the other a bartender the other two our servers and they all are like one of them is just behind the bar picking up the glasses that that got knocked over the other is kind of picking up shuffling one of the decks of cards the other is just pocketing the coins that have left behind from one of the gambling games and the last is stacking up so the plates left behind from one of the tables but all of them don't take their eyes off the three of you it's creepy super creepy cat I don't want to go in that room because I don't trust you but listen here I'm giving you one last chance you can come with us we can go back out of here you can give up the queen of thieves mantle and we can figure something out we can get mouse back I'm giving you another chance to get Mouse back to get control of this whole city and to get everything you want how do you know what I want sebastian you just want to be a hero you want respect you want people to think that you're not a disaster that you won't mess everything up this is your chance to turn that all around everybody here they're all disasters they're all mess ups and together we make one hell of a party sebastian you already are a hero you already fixed your mistake and are here doing right yeah don't let her get in your head this is just a trick like all of her tricks she won't even show her true face you have to buy goggles and as for you veo as you you want to restore the royal family isn't that what you want I'm already doing it are you I am by backing a usurper he is a he has Cleo I mean she eyes you up and down [Music] we could take care of your wife and if you're interested you don't talk about her you leave her out of this you could have everything you all want we could work together and do it I'm already gonna get what I want today and that's without you you seem to think that joining the Queen's men is some sort of prize you and I are both disasters I'm not asking you to join the Queen's men these people they don't join me they don't join anybody they work for themselves and they get paid for it they're all here because they want to be here no one's forced to be here and I'm not gonna force you to work with me I don't need you to if I wanted to force you to work for me I would have done it already but you're far more useful when you're working willingly I don't see that happening cat the way that I see it is you're just a problem that needs to be solved out of the two of us I will admit you're the queen of thieves and I'm the king of a rat problem and we've we've both done some prepaid some bad choices but we need to work together to solve those problems the problem is I'm asking you to step down right now because I have friends and these two right here know they're not gonna listen to anything you have to say this might be your only chance Sebastian if this was my only chance I wouldn't be placing bets [Music] all right do I stab her now or what like a wheat honey Atta what I don't know I don't want to kill did you ever think for a moment how you were going to find any of the badges did you ever think for a moment how you were going to get the box did you ever think for a moment that they might already be in a place completely beyond your grasp as if I would be carrying them with me wherever I go [Music] that's another problem on the list we have a little if you even want a chance at any of those things what are you gonna do did she just talk to me in my head nervous are you okay [Music] you've got nothing you came here you made a huge bet on nothing guys she's calling me out project operation mayhem then call her Bluff the only thing that's keeping her the only thing that will keep her alive is that and if she doesn't tell us where the stuff is or just go find it just like we did before exactly what does she's the only one who has access to it then it's sealed away forever what if we don't kill her what if we just I definitely am the only one that has access to that information by the way what no stop this is a private line this is a private line can you not use you this is Road hang up I can hear you breathing this is fun you three have such a wonderful internal monologue fish fish can speak as for you I love you he used to be cool I'm still cool cat what happened what you know that you can't take the throne you know that the last time we had a spellcaster on a throne it was a problem and that problem caused Wars whole armies fought to take down a mage on the throne what do you think is going to happen if you take the throne okay so you win here so you kill us you and your Queens men take the castle you sit upon the throne evidence will come out I'll make sure of it so you say a mage can sit on the throne and I say I want the throne for myself and I'd like to just tell you that two things can be true you're a mage I'm not tracking you're a member of the amethyst Academy there's records of that in the amethyst Academy of course they're adjectives on --ts to just put like a like a puppet on the throne is that your play oh you're just gonna use your your shape-shifting abilities right just be somebody else on the throne seems rather predictable doesn't it yeah that's kind of why I guessed it well the cute ones are always so dumb all right I guess we're done I want to I want to pull out Ignatius and I go buddy but I need you now more than ever and I won't and I want to see if the the zone of truth becomes active the Ignatius says back to you you know low rumbling voice but he's just build the blood of a valiant man you would you will repent you will atone you will prove your faith and truth and then my light will shine for you but not before how can I do that how can I prove to you what do I need to do see yours are for the first hand before the flame seek atonement and then then my light will shine for you again you were no help and to be fair though I haven't given a good apology so like I can understand where you're coming from magic swords men so testy if we're done here then I think I'm going to be on my way before the rattling is completely consumed this entire fortress you're not going anywhere try and stop me I just like wave my arm behind me I'm like is she behind she I'm keeping my eyes on her now or a blackjack Mel are we still looking like two backsies no I left that down okay she's gonna move to leave I'm going to go to grab her arm okay let's roll for initiative you stop lady listen lady the big

at you as you reach out to grab her and she is going to cast a spell and she will start off okay but let's let's start things off nice and Simran didn't roll those saves okay she is gonna cast about does that trigger your mage flare Oh baby oh yeah okay so go for it Oh Oh actually I think it happens after I've always considered it a unless it's gated it stops this beat the arcane energy as she she basically puts her hand on her rapier don't reach for something and the arcane magic comes forth you feel this force racking through your body and Sebastian she didn't even move or speak she performed no somatic or verbal components but you can tell that a spell is happening because she has just cast power word pain uh on Sebastian and Vale oh no depot do you guys have less than 100 hit points yes and we're both affected with no saving TRO I guess a what yep and go ahead and mage layer it okay just really bad I get a is it worth it I get a 15 um I got no there's not nice you bring her your sword down and she just steps forward like almost like she wasn't even there to begin with ah and as she she does so she looks at Sebastian and veo and she says you want to know real pain feel it and this wave of wracking pain strikes through both your bodies and it assails both of you since you both have 100 hit points or fewer you were both subject to crippling pain you your speed is no higher than 10 feet you have a disadvantage on attack rolls ability checks and saving throws other than constitution saving throws and if you try to cast a spell you have to first succeed at a constitution saving throw or the casting fails and the spell is wasted at the end of each of your turns you can make a constitution saving throw to try to shake it off whoa excuse her okay though it is your turn I push through the pain and and then she's gonna move over to the bar and she leaps over to the bar and begins bolting all right back here she's bolting yep she's running how far away is she from you just like disadvantaged on a bill you have disadvantage on literally everything she's like 15 feet she's got a speed you only moved her 20 feet she's like I removed her 31 2 3 but her speed isn't 30 feet her speeds 40 oh gosh okay we're gonna get her I am going to I'm gonna go for the attacks okay you got this veil 17 the the arrow comes forward you push through the pain and shoot and she literally cartwheels around the the she cart wheels as well as you start firing bullets at her nope critical mass critical miss load the dice and less than that okay so I'm going to use my bonus action mm-hmm to - cool your speed can never be higher than 10 feet under power or pain so dashing does not increase your speed so it's still 10 feet yeah my feelin agility is all your cos feline agility is a bonus to your speed yeah and your underpowered Payne your speed can never be higher than 10 feet okay I move 10 feet sir okay okay and now you can make a constitution saving throw it is with no constitutions that would be this spell would be brutal if it also made its yeah it's Constitution to get out of it nope what you get for okay still okay it hurts okay she is going to spend her first she is going to spend her first legendary action and as she does so she pulls two of her invisible daggers out and throws the match Aveo hey she gets a 21 and a 15 to hit one of them hits okay that will be ten points of piercing damage okay the queen of Thieves lair opens a there is a rumbling as as two of the walls though they open up in in the room basically the the walls Rumble and shake almost like they for a moment Sebastian you see this it's almost like they flicker out of existence become illusions don't become illusions and flicker back into place and as they as this flickering occurs two massive feline creatures walk out of the walls they have six legs and rippling skin that is flickering with all all these but with all the spectrums of color and so they're they're almost like a prismatic dazzling beast but up from their backs are are waving these pair of long tentacle limbs that have delirium tipped barbs on the on the ends of them so they come out of the walls where that where the doors are being flanked so one from the from beside the staircase and one from beside that the devil doors [Music] there yeah and then they won moves forward and it's going to lash it's their turn next so one will make two two attacks against veo and one will make two attacks against pollute oh hello so against pollute oh I get a big old 6 and a 9 and against veo I got a 14 and a 23 ok they owe you take 7 points of bludgeoning damage and 5 points of piercing damage as this raped barb lashes against your back Oh her or us Pluto why is your turn stop her or save us get her did you do so cat came out of the wall yes president and he has to flicker this this prismatic cat it flickers in and out of reality almost like this abrupt change as it as it's all of a sudden just 18 inches in another direction or forward and jolting in and out of reality neat I'm going to take a big old step back ok and just try to and I actually I'm gonna try to run over here towards video so I'm gonna take us take a swing from it ok it is a reach of 10 feet so when you leave its reach for proper it gets a 24 2 hits that hits so that will be a grand total of 13 points of

down on her nice catching her for [Music] 23 damaged okay now is powered pain concentration it is not darn it yep as the blade comes down on her it crashes into her and she cries out for for a brief moment as as she crumples and drops to the ground split open what it's a trick Sebastian is she is this her I don't even know what's going on anymore guys you look over it's an illusion and she's standing 60 feet by the back door oh oh oh gosh did I not see that did she just I fill my hands up ludos blade came down on her you you watched as in the moment the blade hit her she disappeared and became an illusion and she appeared over 60 feet feet away and the illusion died does that trigger my mage Slayer it does not oh so I'm standing over her body victorious proud of myself yeah I really did it guys well that was easy other night porn it was a little [ __ ] Pluto she's over there I don't understand she's right here and she's dead I'm standing on her corpse the want the version of her that is over there is invisible well good work on me and I pat myself on the back she spends her legendary action and you also all of you see the door open up and close back back behind you what was that what was that just that this tavern door link hurt Sebastian it's very windy in here she just got away Pluto oh but I thought I could didn't you I didn't I didn't even it's so many things ready it's the gangs turn no the gang's all here okay they leap forward and one of them I'm gonna have one of them leap towards each of you and yeah so one to Sebastian one to veo and then two will leap to pollute oh hello and they will surround and the two and the two on Pluto one gets a 18 hits no the other gets a 25 to hit that's good okay that's good for it they will sneak attack getting a total of team of 17 points of damage as they come and encircle you and well they make a bunch of strikes with the rapiers that they draw only one managed to find purchase and stab it deep deeply into you the other to attack Sebastian and Vale against Sebastian I get a 14 and a natural one and against feyo I get a 19 of a 23 both hit like a shield okay I am sure I cache you okay both of you need to make Constitution checks to castle spells because you're under power word pain oh no 25 you successfully do no survey oh you take you take [Music] 8:14 points of regular stab damage and then I got a help I got a help bail another 20 points of sneak attack you need to figure this out from the to basically oh sorry not 20 points it's only 10 points and sneak attack because only one was attacking you and you only get sneak attack points my bad so yeah he comes around and basically stabs the rapier into you and follows it up with a dagger dagger into your side hey that's my move okay and finally Sebastian all right seam the door open and close I kind of grit my teeth through the pain and I start mumbling some incantations and suddenly there's silence around me as you hear all the sand go and then I will try to attempt to cast sunder step okay nice okay make that Constitution saving throw it's not with disadvantage it is not you don't you get disadvantage on everything private like at a 10 okay you do not cast understand waste the spell slot anyway thanks thanks magic yep yep Oh guys I I size her up earlier I think she's way stronger than us that was such a letdown I'm Sebastian I mean if I move I get opportunity attacks and I can only move 10 feet so no I'll just make my Khan save to try to not be in so much pain [Applause] now that's gonna be a 15 that is a failure cool cool cool cool cool fifteen failure yep she's strong thanks does she lot stronger than I did I plan with the dice giveth and the dice taketh we do indeed we go to the top of the round the queen of thieves is not on the board currently veo it is your turn self-preservation I'm gonna turn to the guy in front of me emotional or physical I am going to take one of my potions of invisibility oh okay you drink smart invisibility oh and I'm going to after doing this move ten feet towards Pluto come on over water's great are you staying within the reach of all that you can in a bonus action cunning a disengage using my cunning action and get ten feet away from my current spot nice I'm gonna roll my con this is it twelve no I would okay sending dice everyone sorry BAE oh okay the queen of thieves is off the board so her lair no longer applies I can't use the same one anyways so the just the are my cat's well one of them is going to I think they're both gonna encircle Sebastian oh god oh no one gets an 18 and a 9 and the other gets a 16 and a end at eight okay I'm gonna make a con safe to try to cast shield nice I love power word pain I not my favorite okay I get on twenty that is a success I cast shield blocking all of those attacks so as they come around basically the they all try to lash lash you ripping at your legs and your sides but you managed to block and deflect all the attacks with with your shield the the complete envelopment of the shield protecting you from like the distortions and snapping of all of their their various limbs basically like hunched over holding myself with my staff in my hands like a little running on my staff and there's just like energy coming out of it just enough that they'll smash up against it pull it over over to you I I'm just gonna start swinging at these the bartender and the cans and the gambler guy like the staff the waitstaff are stabbing yeah this is the worst establishment I've ever been to crit that's closest dude I just turn around I go stop stabbing me I have money to spend I'm a paying customer damn it I could get a a big old sorry the math is hard 21 21 that is 21 damage that leaves them bloodied and then I'm those taking all the dice luck for me too I know yeah turn pause and I hit him again for a twenty six that is a hit for fifteen damage fifteen damage is he's no but he still stands and as he does his face twitches and contorts and and for a moment like from the crit like his face changes and kind of goes back into position like as if the damage knocked off his face and he and actually on that second hit I'm gonna use a battle master move and then I want to I want to do trip attack okay so he's gonna take an extra walk she first make your strength save 17 he fails he takes another 8 damage he takes another dead damage to the ground forever I stand on his body be proud of your trip you ain't getting up and I'm still really proud of myself thinking that I've killed more than him ok the gang unperturbed the the one of the gang members rushes in towards Sebastian I still have my shield student still this dude watching it he's running at you it was coming at you getting a critical hit critical ash is the shield a magical shield shatters apart what I imagine actually is that he comes in low and you're pulling the shield energy down and he comes right up and stabs you right under the rib cage and like slips underneath the shield the energy of the shield so that will be a grand total of 28 points of sneaky that sneak attack critical damage plus another so 38 points of damage from the sneak attack critical you good cool good you've been maxing your crits right yeah yeah I do max I do damage plus an X we use in that new fun role cool so that's that's him the one other veil is invisible so the other to encircle Pluto come on over getting a critical hits on thanksfully top and the other one is a is a 24 this time I'm gonna cast shields and the crit doesn't count but it still goes through but I don't get crit anyway ok and then I also get a 24 and a 22 so they both miss because of the shield but the crit comes through but regular damage yeah spring of spells storing yeah so they go up so the regular sneak attack then is merely 16 points of damage I accept man that hurt they hurt me Sebastian it is your turn can i telepathically just wait did you roll your save against our paint anything yes can I quickly just like send a message to everybody on the channel just being like the Queen is escaping and all eyes out and then still take my turn yeah ok so I I do that I

power pain yeah yeah the pain feels like it's going to be forever that's what the pain feels like all right with that we go to our cats who are very confused because they don't have any targets anymore they wink and blink and their displacement fields come back into place at the end of its next turn okay and they move one moves - I think you know what both of them are gonna - towards Sebastian how far can they go they have speeds of 40 feet so they're gonna move 80 and and they're gonna leap over the bar to do so to avoid avoid the melee we gluto no come over here I'm really fun I'm technically - I think I'm still under shield so I have no reaction anyway I appear at the other end of the room and I'm like I feel much better and there's for a moment yeah okay and now we go to political they are are you okay I'm here I can't see you so you're not dead if you didn't just die no okay cool I'm gonna keep killing her you need help I'll be okay well 27 to hit dude that's closest to you I just I'm just I'm just like turning around cleaving and like they're trying to there's they're circling circling circling checking out their opponent and you managed to catch one like with a brutal blow for sixteen damage and then I also want him to make a strength save he gets a 13 and he's gonna take an extra five damage and he's prone nice and then I'm just gonna hammer a guy again arrived at home getting a twenty nine to hit yes oh sorry I get oh it's still 1929 it for 14 damage he is bloodied but not dead how am i okay okay action surge I'm just gonna keep nice I gotta end it 21 to hit also hit for 16 damage you knock him to the ground stabbed him again and hit him right in the face and as as the dies they go back into the front and they their corpses basically melt into these amorphous blobs as if they didn't even have bones oh it's on my shoe Oh get it off and then I finished killing the blob man I turn around and I just I just take like an overhand swing at dude beside him for a 60 26 to hit hit 10 damage nice and actually I want him to make a strength save he gets natural 2000 he still actually I want to just check he still takes 5 extra damage but he's not not perfect okay the two surviving doppelgangers look at each other and the one that's standing by the table that talked about the damage from thunder step bolts up the staircase now the other one disengages and tries to bolt but it's gonna provoke enough excuse me I get a 29 to hit for 14 damage that leaves him bloodied and he's just gonna stand there yep as he gets caught in the blow and count I stabbed him in the shoe cries out stop it okay and running Sebastian I feel really bad about this guy just collecting coins but I'm looking at options is wrong gambling is wrong and he should have known that and that's gonna be from the staff of power I just like want to end this I'm just like I'm running at me and just as they both jump I go yeah fire and I just explode the room with a fireball that hits both of them from the staff of power okay so let's roll a wild magic surge the displays rubies fail their dexterity saving trust good good again in 82 and 82 it's the worst thing on it but you can take one additional action immediately power stab how many charges is your staff have remaining that took let's find five you use it for one other thing earlier I said I'm not I have nine charges left as a fifth level stuff spell so it's 10 d6 damage and you'll be able to take one additional action immediately man that 82 right save that bank that thang that 82 we can shoot out on 82 yeah so as the fireball goes off you feel this wave of arcane energy take through you with erratic energy and it's like at the same time time and tracks and expands for you I think we're gonna stick with this yeah I'm not even gonna use okay so there's so many dice so many forty-three okay they are both rendered visible they are not destroyed by it but they are very very badly burned they're not they're not dead no but they're very badly burned on the other hand the the gambler is nothing more than a charred husk as are all the tables and chairs as as like a few alcohol fires but it was so superheated that it consumed all the alcohol immediately bits of gold that are melted to the ground you just hear me yell is like the fireball explodes on that like centered on that guy I'm just like he was a bad guy too was he I don't know it was a changeling you just tell us it's a changeling and we believe you or a doppelganger because we don't know oh man I'm running out of notice staff his name was I don't want to know his name oh he can name was gamblin Gary this was his last big job before he went home to his family he was collecting all of his coins because he just won the big score to pay off the debt to pay for her his stones daughter's University man you know and is his little son was gonna be able to get the operation everything was gonna come together he was gonna go show me yeah I'm gonna things that he a to do to get the money and play at this table you know the sacrifices that he made but now all the gold that he had was all melted to the ground oh man does that make you feel better it's for him I'm gonna I'm gonna cast darkness on myself okay you can start and you can do that because you haven't cast a spell as a bonus action take two actions you can test cast I got an extra action immediate yeah oh yeah yeah and that's that's an ability just for all those who fall in long home and this is why he can do this to sorcery points okay now I'm surrounded in darkness hopefully that the the the cats can't see me okay I hope I don't know vo it's your turn I'm still hurting real bad I can move my ten feet forward towards Sebastian I know he's trying to run away and I must be from the photo shoot really there's a bird here yeah I actually looked over it stop it a bird on my back i take another appointment because i'm like i'm still yeah I'm stabbing you're crawling towards I I'm still crawling towards you and I Drive icon just crawling you know like when your cat is in pain its meowing there and I like here is that I don't see anything but I can miss shoes and I'm like against the wall too like Morgan so wall only cuz like you know when cats like they don't want to be around people and they hide without hurting my heart why are so sad this is like this you've wounded me I'm gonna kill the Queen right here next no hesitation yeah guys next time no hesitation who hesitated I swear the displays are cats Wow they whip out their tentacles and one gets a as cats - yeah they with other tentacles as cats do and one with the disadvantage gets a 21-2 hit and the other gets nothing good but what it doesn't wanna get with disadvantaged disadvantage what are these he was 21 these are beautiful dice that I bought at origins and they were very expensive I don't know them because there may be there I spent equally amount of money on these dice and they've rolled so many ones for me well that's because you only buy something you need to buy solid colored dice I like blue and pink we're gonna take that away from me it just means that they have a split personality you can't trust this oh do i because that you know they're it's like either two colors two-faced dice they betray you do your damage mine are solid it's 10 points of blood I accept I'm I'm starting to bleed a lot there's a lot of WOD Pluto you're up I get a 13 - hit him 13 - hits not a hit okay so I'm an arrow what you you lift the sword out of his foot and he uses it to get a little bit of momentum forward and so the first hit is a minute I go up no stop it I have to kill you and I get a twenty six how much damage I've 16 what happens to him I go no no no and then I just cleave him in the back and it's one of those like nasty like from the back right shoulder to the bottom left of his but he collapses into a puddle of cartilage and flesh yeah and then I I start be lining it for the cat's okay as close as I can get can you help me there there the doppelganger [Music] Sebastian it's your turn cats oh man spell slots what are those I still have a queen to fight come on she's gone delirium potion that's true lots of local you okay from my darkness you know what because I'm in darkness I can use my super cool super advantage and I'm just going to how are they looking are they looking hurt they are looking like they're in there they are vicious animals so they pursued their attack but they are very badly burned and also slightly electrocuted or not electrocuted thunderstruck from they've been thunderstruck yes okay I'm just going to fire bolt the one right in front of me cool because I get super advantage on that and I'm just gonna rely on them having disadvantage cool I didn't realize what my bonus was to attack Thank You staff of power I get a twenty eight that is a hit yeah I thought so well and that will be nine damage nine damage that's actually enough to take when I I killed a man with the last blast of flame it collapses into a puddle and and it and parts of it start winking out of reality like the reality is still winking around for it but I yell for help oh I don't have power word pain any more than I have real pain failure all right I'm still in pain but you know what I'm gonna attempt to help out a little bit and I'm going to shoot two times at this cat thing becoming visible are they in my darkness they are it's just as a commanding question for the ointment does it do anything to the power of pain or no no that's ugly right now a veil has disadvantage for being power obtained disadvantage for the darkness and disadvantage because they're displacer beats displacing so she's super but but you say yeah she's like go for it you stand at my right shoot to my right 13 so a Sebastian is like oh no this thing's gonna smack me then I was like I imagine that like I can see veo and I'm like she's pointing the bow and I'm like no more to the right more to the right that she's like pointing it at me yeah yeah you're like okay and you're beside it right you're beside it yep so I get my sneak attack yeah the 3d6 do you want one of mine sure let's see [Music] 27 it is shot in the jugular and ace and a spurt of displacing blood comes out and it gurgles and collapses to the ground there's one last gambler that is under one of the tables in the other end of the room that's still scooping up coins and being like I don't mean no man ever mind I'm just kidding my money where what the Queen go from here I pointed the shaky finger oh wait actually I got my Constitution 13 I pick vayo up he are the guys at the north end of the room and he's just trying to run right up the stairs as it collapses money guys so not those stick guys we gotta go we gotta move carry my high pick up veil me yeah we don't were in no condition to fight the Queen we have to catch up to her what are we gonna do if we catch her you see they walk shows there's four exits from this room there are the double doors the stairs leading down in in here and the doors that there's another set of doors behind the bar and a set of double doors across from the door so there's five exits in this room the set of doors that you came through was the set of door was the door that the queen of thieves exited I'm in no condition to even track the only concern I have is that she could be anything and like if even if we've got all our eyes on the street looking for her she could be anyone I have I have the ability to find her if she's on the street that's even better we have a whole army up there are we gonna let her get away again Sebastian we can't let her get away again Pluto let's do it you kind of let her get away it's true actually and now you're gonna put us in jeopardy because you hesitated and I don't know how to explain this to you but your cat is like dying and all you're worried about now is catching her you had an opportunity mom and you made a choice I was just talking I didn't I didn't know she was gonna flee what did you expect this is what it's not your fault but what you're asking us to do is now far beyond suicide we need to find a way we she has the bombs she has all the cards we need to regroup she doesn't have them she told us she didn't have them well you know what guys maybe if we'd gone in the room and talked to her we could have figured something out you guys were gung ho about us we don't know that she's talked to us before she's had every opportunity to kill us and she hasn't yet were the ones who pulled the trigger and she fled so you're saying it's on me what if we had gone into that room and talked you can't just decide that my actions are the only ones at fault here no you're right you're right but then if what you're asking me to do is is that then I'll I'll do it I trust you but if we need a rest then we need a rest but we need we need nobody can let you know what nobody can let anybody escape we have all the exits blocked right eyes honor is what we need she III actually I go in and I'm like guys just jupiter Ansem hey what's going on we're fighting pretty hard up here but most of them are running away you can't let anybody through the queen of thieves has escaped we have all exits blocked as far as I know there's no possible way that she can get out of here she could be posing as anybody jupiter says we knocked over this tavern up here there's a really awesome fighting pit downstairs and they were all gambling it's a it's a really cool place we should have duels down here sometime yeah let's block the exits block the exits this is code well ed I strangled one of them and he admitted to me that there was a passage into the sewers down here don't go into the sewers we have those blocked as well do not go into the sewers do not and some checks in we're we're doing really well up here we've got we've got all the major taverns that we know the Queen's men frequent blocked off the streets all blocked off a lot of them are holding out and we're we've got they're taking shots at us we're taking shots at them but no one's getting up and down the streets of the city unless we handle it we just but Jupiter says that they've got entrances to the sewers down there and we don't have anybody down in the sewers we have we've blocked the sewers when we were down there we've got this covered okay listen Ansem we came up through the sewers there was an entire I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have guys I'm gonna have truth this I'm gonna have truth is Ignatius isn't listening he's never as we were going through the sewers we found that they had a bunch of Tabac see keeping rattling zazz slaves what they were doing a mining operation down there we disrupted the mining operation and now it's utter chaos and rattling czar flooding the sewers rattling x' you say pathetic killed rattling kill them on sight but the sewers are flooded with rattling she is not getting out that way Ansem I've got one more thing for you you need to send somebody back with a message telling them that rattling czar coming through the underground they've been digging this whole time wait what we found this out I need you to get everybody to safety now wait Lord Commander are you telling me to retreat or are you telling me to send a runner back to centre runner send two runners make sure this message gets back to the hooded Lanterns barracks immediately is river still on the line yeah River is and she's back at the hooded lanterns yeah we don't need to send her on a river hey what's up how's it going uh lord commander needs to tell you something get everybody out of there now there's an attack coming from underground and it's gonna take so many of our troops out wait what who's attacking us from underground fiends animals Rawlings we found this out they've been slaves to the queen of thieves and they've built tunnels all the way around the city wait the queen of thieves is using rattling to tunnel underneath the city yes yes yes after it's after the queen of thieves had a mining operation with many rattling we have set them free also there are tunnels below the hooded Lantern's base and the rattling is plan to use them but the rattling numbers have been swelling ever since we killed we defeated the Lord of the feasts it's because the mean of thieves is controlling all the rattling x' the this is a huge problem the rattling tsar out of control nobody is controlling the rattling x' anymore except possibly a demon but that's a story wait another time wait are you saying the queen of these is a demon no there's no time to explain the rattling czar a problem there's problems everywhere just be aware that there's a tunnel underneath your base look you just have to know this and we have to deal with her incident and that's where we're gonna take our break and we are back from our

broken glass a tankard that was smashed by a warrant by a splintering piece of timber as the fireball went off earlier spilling out some watered-down beer all across the floor muttered entity and you are here by the door where the queen of thieves ran out I know we're hurting guys but we can't let her get away I don't want to let her get away again look Sebastian I was upset she tricked me I thought I murdered her and you know me I love I just love killing and the thing is is that we got here together and there's no blame not on you we share it it's on us they on the other hand is blameless because she was she's just crawling still less on me more on other so I walk over cuz Vera's visible in that right she shot her but I pick her up under my arm thank you and I go what do you want to do there you can roll you can roll a couple saving throws 20 20 okay okay and then you scratch me to put you down so actually I'm afraid that is not the case they oh you have no memory of what just happened well she got away snap out of it she got away you you're hurt she got away she's right here we're going after her guys we're going after Pluto do you trust me to clarify there you have no recollection make a saving throw what con intelligence Oh nein okay so you forget everything that occurred from the moment the spell took hold of you to this moment how do I even get on this side of the room she cast a spell on you well I mean of course it's magic that's the only thing that makes sense in this scenario do I still have all my stuff and I start to like Pat my pockets and thank goodness one of your potions has been has been consumed so you're somewhat expired your crossbow with your fish guys we have more important matters you're fine you took your own potion you took your own ointment that's your fish stop spray with water spritzer fine I'll take your word for it but Val do you trust me yeah Pluto do you trust me yes we have a queen to catch then let's get her don't you go now that's our moment I burst through the door you burst through the door and you're in the short hallway from where the spiral staircase that led up from the level below was you recall this is a t-shaped hallway with a door at the end of it opposite the stairs the stairs are ones that lead down to where the fighting pits are under where the arena was where you battled big Linda do you guys think that maybe she's down there waiting as you as you open the door you can hear the sound of jingling coins and rustling metal and some yeah and coming up the stairs is blackjack Mel pulling an over Laden sack of gold weapons and other and other things from from the lower levels any seized units like hey I'm just taking this out for the Queen you understand it's it's definitely not for me I don't ever think the other blackjack Mel was yeah we really get behind man this is the it's refreshing to see you but I also want to murder you yeah it's been less than 10 minutes because you guys didn't take a rest it's the real blackjack Mel Mel Mel Mel did any that the Queen run past you or did you run faster I've been well I just been here trying to pull this bag up these stairs I knew she was in because I mean no one else has gone past me it's just been needed I think a ton of people are dead down there Vera can you track I can try but I don't know what else is there is much to track is there any footprints you can see on any like we we hit Pluto what are you doing it down here you critter right I create an illusion of her was she wounded at all she was not uh no blood we're that we're on orders to meet with the Queen but we don't we don't know where she's gone to we need to get to her oh well I mean I would imagine she's probably booked it by now but if she's gone one or two places she's either gone to her meeting room or you can go through there to where her her office is I have trust issues with Mel's so I do kind of grab them by the scruff yeah and I go you better not be lying to me right now I don't know I'm just guessing we're at the end of our yarn here I mean all all's I can tell you is that the queen of thieves leaves by any door she chooses she could take it all of us here are always weirded out by her because she goes through a door to a 1-1 room and comes in from another one whenever she's around you never know what directions she's gonna come in and everybody thinks she's got the whole place rigged up with all sorts of little hidden twisty passages that only she knows about I think she went up but I don't know she could literally go through the door and not end up in this hallway I think I have an idea yeah what do you think Pluto if you carry me mm-hmm and hi this is just a trick to get me to carry I mean I'm not gonna yeah if if you carry me and I go in to Crowley so you carry me and the three of us go in one direction and I said and croley up the like in another direction okay we can cover more ground okay let's do it this is the top level of these stairs Oh so the stairs from here go down only what about secret passages do you see any can you keep your eyes on the walls with with my goggles I start looking around at the walls to see if I can find anything nothing nothing here is illusory but whether or not but again your true sight only reveals illusions it wouldn't reveal anything that had been been mechanically hidden okay mell where's her office well she has an audience chamber right through through that door but and then there's this hallway that she goes down where most time people say that's where her vault is I guess we're going the vault should I bother with the curly or should we just head for the vault would curly see her if she's invisible no you would those goggles is more valuable than Crowley yeah that's fair but keep crawling ready sorry buddy I got I think we go down to the vault everything's if you're going to the vault what do you want Mel just said and just saying the information is valuable and I deserve a finder's fee Mel I'm gonna kill you in a second if you don't give me that bag of gold right now and I just take the bag of gold from him all of his stuff he's loaded about a hundred pounds worth of gear and equipment and other things into this bag so there's gold and I literally just pick it up and I just dump it into the bag of whole thing finder's fee Mel and if I ever thought you guys were cool we were great ever catch you and being impersonated by the Queen again wait what the Queen was impersonating you why don't you buy associate I am aghast and offended good that is identity theft yeah why are we robbing personation definition identity theft I'm very impressed but ultimately you know it takes she must have been amazing with but like it was convincing right mal you have seconds before rats are gonna eat you Mel very good point I take the as you're pouring the gold into my bag I take like my a littler bag and like fill a bit and I hand it to blackjack mal and I'm like sighs sounds a chunk of money in it listen I can't give it all to you because Pluto just literally stole it from you and we're in a hurry sorry that's all I got love you mail by cool he runs back up to the door that you came through and runs back and you hear him run up the stairs out of the are we after the Queen or we say are we friends with Mel both can we just can we put our he's literally the nicest Queens man I've ever met sure I'll have to stay on target yeah let's go let's go you're the one Robin do go to the vault let's go on the way can I drink a delirium potion yeah go ahead delirium potion one you get two levels with the spells back yeah that doesn't fully help me okay so you were at the intersection here with the door to the Queen that now pointed you at the door back to the under tavern and the stairs down to the Queen's arena which way will you go do you guys want to go to the let's go to the audience chamber and then take the hallway to the vault yeah let's do it okay I'm taking a potion and some I'm rubbing a bunch of ointment as we're running okay on my you open the door and it opens up into a large octagonal chamber supported by several pillars throughout the room are several barrels and boxes and various and all hung up along the walls here are stacks of valuable art paintings all in gold frames stacked up all along the walls and all are all through through the room so there there are immaculate paintings by the old masters of Drakon Heim paintings by famous Caspian and illyrian painters even some small works of sculpture that have all been hung up and preserved in this room can I tell if these are from the castle looking at these paintings there are none that you would recognize from the castle but also you're not really an art historian so just not sure how like may give me an intelligence check and let's just see if you recognize and maybe maybe something from you recognized that some of the painters here you recognize one of the paintings which is a historical painting of the one of the great battles that led to the that was a battle fought between Devon castles and a caspian army years and years ago and you recognize that the painter of this is likely a painter that painted a bunch of paintings in the castle about 50 years ago and is long dead hmm yeah so paintings in here at your best guess you recognize some of the paintings you might have gone to other nobles estates as a child yeah and some of these paintings might be familiar like be like I think I saw that hanging in someone's estate once yeah yeah but definitely none from the castle really been racking up all the valuables from around Rackham time at least we know where they bought I don't see her in this room though do I know there is a set of double doors there's actually two sets of double doors here one that you can surmise connect directly to the under tavern and another that lead out of the room as well the one the other ones are probably what Mel was talking about I mean the one set of doors very clearly go back to the room and go back to the tavern you guys want to do the other doors let's do it it just a thought real quick is there a chance you saw her leave the room right yes is there a chance that she left this room and just appeared in another room yes yes okay but I don't I don't know what to do with that information I don't I this is our best the streets are covered the sewers are covered we she she could escape but I feel like there's a chance that she's still around here somewhere okay let's go for it all right we go through those I'm gonna mage Han to open the double doors and I'm staying near you you got it you got to be my eyes you're my eyes push the doors open and it leads to a short hallway about 30 feet long at the end of which is another door I float the mage hand over and attempt to open the other door the door opens up right and immediately the corridor heads to the north after the door I feel uneasy about this hallway I reach into a tan bag and I Huck are we doing animal testing on these fibers I Huck a black bear into the hall move only you can prevent hallway its death how isn't good that I was trying to like a smokey thing I got it I mean I know you got it but I didn't like it it's a brown bear specifically what's his name JK growling thank you okay so we saw it so you're gonna get JK rowling query where are you guys standing then I'm at the doorway in the double doors okay JK growling is going to - and and through to the other side and go through the door yeah jakey growling does so and the standing at the door we did it and then I run it and I run the length of the hallway okay you were through the second door pollito ahead of you ahead of you and jakey growling is a hallway that extends down about sixty feet before coming to a staircase that leads upwards and out of sight right before the staircase though the hallway Forks off into another hall I want to use the Bears keen smell he relies on smell and his advantage on smell checks for perception can he smell the Queen nobody smells your putt nah stop it Jake a grilling focus the mayor also isn't smart enough to know what the the bear has never smelled the Queen's the bear does not know what the pair of the Queen smells like putting a smell of a guy oh it's me or its veil it's probably a veil is there still that like fake Queen body lying on the ground or was that an illusion yeah it's still there I smell the body oh my go and ice no I said yeah I say to shake a growling to the body okay it's an illusory body and it has no smell and it's but the illusion is still there can you pick it up no you can't touch it it's just there like you like the image of it is just there and you can put your hand through it but it's intangible I get up on the a mental walkie-talkie and I say River got a question for you yeah is there any way to track someone who did a spell and left the residue of it behind an illusion do you know the detect magic spell I do not that could be useful detect magic can be very useful in detecting visual illusions as can spell like as as can spell that allow for true seeing or otherwise we know we know that it is an illusion and we're just trying to track the person who did this bill mm you'd require powerful magic indeed to find a spell a spell caster by their spells okay thank you stay online please hold please hold you're forwarding your call I have a ritual to detect magic okay I do the ritual okay so you're gonna spend ten minutes to cast the TEC magic as a ritual I mean can you keep your eyes open cuz my only concern is that she's invisible she was walked past us if you're not looking I will read from my book and look up periodic I really you need to be basically stationary to cast the spell as the ritual yeah I mean I guess we don't my choice do you want to try might I be able to detect a Palika would do I know that using detect magic I might be able to pick up a trail of illusion magic you wouldn't be able to pick up a trail of illusion magic because the other thing as well is that detect magic only allows you to see detect auras on things that you can see so something that is invisible isn't detected right now you could conceivably combine truesight with the tec magic and then you'd be in business I have the truce like goggles yep so you need to activate them again and then and cast detect magic at the same time but but again it's a spell caster doesn't leave a residue behind after they cast a spell or a residue behind after they they so I can't like something horizon zero dawn this and just follow a trail no no I like where there you're under you're up to something I like it should we just keep chasing her or should you follow this I mean you could inspect and see if you find any passage of trace trace of passage as you do it okay she's using those two items are you gonna use your spouse or are you gonna what are you gonna do or are we just like you I could I can search for a passage of trace just know but with my truesight goggles still on okay you want your truesight goggles on you want to activate them if I'm not doing the ritual then it's still within 10 minutes of the first casting is it not yes yeah we'll say it's only yeah you're true site is still active okay yeah so with the goggles on I want to investigate this room and look for any traces of passage okay so looking through this room all of the paintings have an aura of aberration magic on them [Music] what does that mean I walk up and I touch one of the paintings oh but you're just true seeing them you didn't detect magic I was confused okay I'll pass no I I guess I'm giving that one to you but no let's say I use detect magic and I'm gonna reach rigor my chance seeing just because now you've given me that information and it seems it makes it our kana check touch it [Music] 23 the paintings have all been magically preserved without your abjuration magic I look to you for answers she wants to keep them nice I'm like touching one of them is it just a normal painting yeah it is but as you go to touch it it's almost like there's a thin layer of magical force that is protecting the painting itself this doesn't give us any clues to where she is but these paintings are well preserved with magic we are in the paintings are there any people there are paintings of famous battles there are paintings of their religious paintings there are portraits of various famous people from the history of the city this is just a very impressive art collection right and what what is in some cases what is notable about the paintings because you none of you have really really knowledge about anything but you could but lesbians have appreciation for art this be as Caspian sand as a noble what is notable about these paintings many of them is not what they depict but who painted them are they all painted by the same person no they are not but looking at them and looking at the signatures on them these are paintings by some of the greatest artists of the past 100 years I take my longbow with one of my magic arrows I shoot my paintings the painting deflects off the arrow defects on the wild wild shot I'm gonna just take off one of the paintings off the wall it comes off the wall but then so does the that little sheen over it's as if the spell that's on it is baked into the frame not the pan that I'm protecting the paper I don't I don't think this is a clue guys I think these are just nice paintings I'm gonna take one with me okay most of these paintings are between four feet and five feet and like these are large paintings there are some small ones I want to take one small this is like 2 feet by 2 feet I'm gonna take one of the portraits it is 2 feet by 2 feet in size do you have much to take it yeah okay it is a portrait of a woman with a very curious smile it's just for my dad trying to put it in the bag no okay I want to keep it can we should we keep going let's go down the hallway go Jake you okay growling onwards okay JK Rowling proceeds further down the hallway and gets to the stairs and goes mom does he's hungry I mean that he smells it I don't he's not helpful at all I thought there was just a trap in this hallway but guys do we go up the stairs or down the other hallway just fine I'll be our scout I guess Vale and I walk forwards we're letting her get to us we have to go back into team dragonforce you're right Dragonforce huddle she's tearing us apart team Jack and force huddle I love you guys I love you okay we're on the same team more than you know thank you what huh okay I get to the end of the hall and can I like looking around with my magical detection okay you get to the end of the hall where JK Rowling is place yourself Oh actually as we're going down the hall I want to be checking for I'm gonna be pushing my hands on the side and as you come around the next door Sebastian your truce site lights up because the next door and your mage site effectively will call this mage site the combination of true seeing and detect magic the next door is covered in AB duration and Eve occasion magic that JK growling open that door actually hold on I strap the painting to his head and I go onward yeah he's gonna be protected he's warded it's fine he's got the observation magic that protects the painting is good okay sure okay and he runs forward okay JK Rowling runs forward and as he does so there is a click as the floor gives out under JK Rowling and he plummets more our distance and then you hear this just squash spike impale thud I'm gonna get Boyce's jakey growling yeah probably not enough I throw a new fuzzy ball over the pit this time it's a tiger the the fuzzy ball is about the pit is about 60 feet deep and it is lined in spikes Wow Weasley snipe no it's a tiger michaël stripe guys big shout-out to Kyle to secure now and he I throw it over the pit and I go onward I'm my dad's gonna mean want that painting more spikes no throw is another it opens up for those of you watching these are fake creatures they come into existence and disappear just like you would like kool-aid like don't even think about it I'm not murdering a bunch of animals and then I Huck another one and this time it's an axe beak ooh oh I don't have that mini that's why use the Bert yeah Billy Talon a spring scent like you gotta give him props I just keep prompting him now can I want to throw them over both at the door I can throw it up the cheese can I can throw it up to 20 feet you throw him you throw Billy Talent at the door he hits the door and as he does so a fire this might be the hallway so after the fire ball explodes and we don't even get to see what the furry ball was you just like baseball because baseball the national sport of Drakken hi that's that's that's Cameron that's cannon we you you just like wind up and you throw the ball straight at the door it hits the door the door explodes still guess we don't have to name that one is it still you know what I'm gonna fly my mage hand over and try to open the door your matron pulls at the door and as your mage hand touches the door the fireball explodes again there's my mage hands still there yeah cuz it doesn't take damage so is it still can it open the door no it can't your mage hand can pick locks can't it yeah hey you guys want to get on the other side of that door yes we can teleport you can only teleport one of us yeah behind step you have to see the spot right yeah yes same way there is this there's about a two foot landing at the base of the door before the spike pit I kept it also fireballs and you made you end it hey hey magic dude yo and also could try the stairs no I mean excuse me were thinking I could I could dimension door on the other side and with one of your help we could try to open it from the other side hold on or will we just well I also catch on fire I have a plan is there any cracks under the door are there cracks under the door make your perception check can it be investigation Shh no because you're not right up to it okay I got a four it's not it the it's not like hermetically sealed if that by by by any stretch it's a LIF there probably is a crack under the door though but you're not sure from this distance I also kind of noticed like a mechanism that might be a keyhole or anything like that there's a there is a latch but there is no there is no actual keyhole well guys I think I have an idea Pluto maybe they oh I don't think I will I'm betting on it I'm sure this is a magically sealed door though I can turn into wind or gas or Cass yeah and then I can fit through small cracks so if you guys could try my mage in first so I send my invisible mage hand over and I want to see if I can go under they meet the door your mage hand can't slide underneath the door but there is purchase underneath it the fireball goes off again when your matron touches the door but you can tell that there is like probably like two millimeters underneath the door like it just enough that it because the door needs like just a little bit to slide right I mean we could just walk the stairs no we can get past this door but yeah beyo do you want to run up the stairs because you're the fastest to see what's up there yeah and then me and me and Sebastian can go on the other side of the door from the base of the stairs you can see the stairs that go up about 50 feet before coming to a landing all right I'd book it up the stair shaking house smells okay I like oh you're back guys as you get about 10 feet up the stairs one of the steps depresses into the floor oh oh I'm sorry yeah and a massive stone boulder drops from the ceiling about the stairs down the stairs roll for initiative no Bayon sorry sing you to your death I fell for it cool cool what you got 18 18 21 10 okay you all beat the rock yay okay so who 21 Johnson do it okay so Pluto what are you gonna do do it what Boulder is careening down the stairs at rapid speed towards Vail is vo close BeOS 10 feet up the stairs you're right beside Sebastian I run up I grab Baio okay and I dimension during the other side of the door okay there is a loud pop and you appear on the other side of the door BAM and I'm like and I just disappear and I'm a student your turn oh and then I like pull out the scroll of gaseous form and I just run and I read it as I like leap into the air and turn into gas you turn into a gas your speed becomes 10 feet so I jump into the air and I go and I just slowly drift towards the door and then up and manage like a fart in the wind under I sleep under the crack without making contact with the door as you do so you hear the boulder careen down the stairs crash into the wall and then you hear this spring open up from the other wall and push the boulder down towards the bar and down down into the next of the insects into the next room where it actually stops at the double doors where it sure you can see this but it it goes towards the other double door has been another pit I was supposed to open up over there and catch it before it crashes it so she's a fan of like the Rube Goldberg machine okay you're in a hallway I'm now you are now gasps we wait later tell your telepathic gasps yes sorry deadly neurotoxin I do see like you see like just a hovering fart next to you guys go quick go down the hallway can you still see what it still has gaseous goggles like on the top of it and if I'm just like floating down the hall Hey all right okay you are gasps yeah all right you see a long hallway with three there's three doors total the one that you came under and a door halfway down the hallway and a door at the end of the hallway all identical and Sebastian with your the spells are still in effect on you you're magicked up so you can see that there are more arcane runes on both of these doors of evolution just AB duration which the play just abjuration and the the last door though has an aura of conjuration if you guys want hello this is my gasps voice oh if you would like I can sneak under these doors and check things out do it all right do it do I feel calm like wind unless I'm raging wind and I'm not calm anyway and I drift I'm gonna drift under this door okay under this door is not a pair of stairs but instead a horrific contraption of spikes and metal with several Spears with with all of these nozzles that are Li that have like a pilot light coming off of them and some of them are leaking a corrosive fluid I seat back out though I don't want to go in that door I was a bad door lot of fun ok I float down the hallway and through under the other door you float down the hallway and under this door is not in fact a pair of stairs you manipulative monster just getting into thinking that I'm gonna go into some safe hallway with stairs and but instead a set of double doors the the hallway ends in a set of double I come back out and I go for some reason I was under the impression that both of these doors would lead to stairs but it turns out that neither of them do do you want me to there's a pair of double doors do you want me to check it out what do you think yeah these double doors you're the Scout now have no sign they are made of iron and they also register an aura of adoration magic no cracks underneath them or anything there are cracks I don't think I should go through there alone that's not how do we get us through this door how do we get us is highway I hope this works I say and I seep under the door again mm-hmm and I re sub Ashton okay from this side do I detect the magic on this side the magic is on this side but the wards are directed on the other way I'm gonna back up and with my mage hand trying to push the door open the door opens all right Pluto all right do we see the door open yeah okay Vail do you want to go one at a time I think we should both book it okay is there anything on the walls that I can climb on there's not I'm I'm all out of scouts you head down these walls these walls are of a very different construction than the others that you looked at they almost look like the the stone on them are like stone panels and they are smooth stone panels and the whole hallway is perfectly flush with itself basically once you went out the first door the first order this hallway just became like smooth stone all the way through so I think I have an idea it's like some of someone completely different built them I take my mage hand and I take out my moveable rod mm-hmm and I get my mate Chan to start patting the floor in front of us okay your mage hand starts patting the floor in front of you anything happen no the walls as well I want to just actually sweep across the walls and everything okay okay that's it I also have an idea for your a movable rod so guys I'm next or I'm next to these giant iron doors when you go in um wait for us no I know but when we go in yeah because if she's in there we close the doors and a movable rod and just guarded we don't get to leave if she doesn't get yeah exactly that's just this is if she's in there for any reason than just nobody's going anywhere okay all right and I I start to Pluto it's safe let's walk down the hall and I'm gonna start walking down the hall still with no cane you walked to the end of my shield ready hi oh that was anticlimactic we just there's been a lot of fire today and spikes I lost a lot of good animal friends now this door can we open it only one way to find out are there warts do I see any words on this story there is arcane there is a duration magic coming from this too I'm age hand oh I was ready I stand behind the corner yeah put yourselves where you want to stand put me in the corner and I'm gonna watch our back okay you okay big guy okay I'm age hand push the doors open they don't budge I try again they don't budge guys my mage hand can't lift these doors Pluto what else you got in your bags just observation magic spell the magic hold on how long is this hallway this hallway is it's this this part of the hallway or 20 feet okay I have a crazy idea but it just might work but it just might work it's all we need where there it is okay just got a check yes all right I go to this wall mm-hmm and I pull the ladder badge and I stick it against this wall for hiding in the doors a 24 foot long ladder so it just goes pretty existence the the doors spring open and as the ladder opens up in curtain says sends them crashing open with that force and there is a blast of magic on the ladder that it tries to like the doors try to target the ladder but because the ladder is an object making our kana check 18 it was trying to polymorph the ladder into a pig the ladder is not a as an object not a creature I turn around the corner and without even knowing if there's anybody in the room i mike scarf starts billowing and i go my name's Sebastian crow and I will not be a pig today sorry okay I run it as you staff to the step step towards the room should I'm a tan to that this is this is baloney this is the floor opens up in front of the door but the ladder is there my name is Sebastian you you can make a dexterity saving throw with advantage because the ladder is on the ground not the ladders over this 18k you fall onto the ladder mine is the for Jesus and basically the ladder yeah you get caught in the ladder in between your legs and you take a shot in the ground Oh my name's Sebastian Crowe and I will not and the pain of that is abating I hope as you look down and you see that 60 feet below you is a bubbling pool of lava I start to weep as I like pick myself back up and like stand on either end of the ladder and then I look into the room and try to look heroic again and I'm just like before you go in and I I do the mage and again on the walls and on the floor okay I put that I put the trap on the wrong tile okay but it's like the one right and it's meant to be the one right in front okay okay it's hard because when you're putting the door of and forge pieces down and the trap he's like you you forget which one is the trapped piece the ultimate stress they look because they just blend in perfectly or anybody see anybody in the room when I work okay so this is what you see in the room you see a beautiful and immaculate office there is a large carved mahogany desk filled with scrolls and papers and stacks of books and then behind it is another table filled with Scrolls stacks of books there are several torches lit and then there are bookshelves all around the room filled with books the behind the chair behind the desk is this beautifully upholstered leather red leather chair and there is a coat rack with several fashionable women's jackets on the coat rack and on on the desk is also a bottle of wine a set of ink pens very very beautiful ink pens and stacks of other books scrolls and several bottles a small eye and there is what looks like a framed picture frame as well and there is finally on the table is a large lockbox as well I don't see anybody in the room but might as well check it out since we came all this way maybe this is where she keeps important stuff I start to hop across the ladder yeah you do so across and I go straight for the photo the framed um hey check it out it is a painting of the royal family I take it I go into the room and I go to the bottle of wine and I check it out okay you touch the bottle of wine the liquid inside is magical and it has an aura of transmutation magic drink it drink it drink it drink it drink it oh wait no the stop has been opened and it looks and there is a bit of lipstick on the bottle itself guess I can take it keep it no just don't drink it please oh she drank it who drank it he wants his lips or her lips were way maybe she used this to get somewhere to look around the room use your goggles I'm using my goggles there on umm I think you should take a sit while you're deciding whether or not you want to drink that outside oh sorry what's the worst thing what would you like to do Pluto I want to just check the the back wall for and like the the exterior for secret doors okay where would you like to check and how would you like to do so back wall I'm gonna start pulling on levers as in like the torches okay you pull on all the torches all the torches are lit but nothing happens you check the back wall where the desk desk is as well and you see that there is a small button on the chair that's it you gotta stop doing the chance cuz I fall for chance all the time drink it drink it press it drink it there's a lockbox yeah there's a lockbox the bottle of wine the portrait the ink and ink pens the scrolls and several books guys what's the worst that can happen and I press the button that I drink from Sebastian you turn into gas ah worked it in the bottles the the bottle is a bottle of wine that is imbued with a potion of gaseous form here we actually there's actually in in the bottle are two more doses of it so Pluto you press the button and when you press the button on the chair the chair animates and very smoothly that's pretty cool but it's also like I wanted something more I sit in the chair yeah I kind of abuse it yeah just very gently it might be the most comfortable chair you ever saw oh my gosh you know it turns out there's a few other buttons on it one of the buttons causes the chair to warm up mm-hmm and one of the buttons causes the chair to start massaging okay I put them all on the tower actually can you check the lock box and see there's a magical about it wait I go into the lock box oh yeah okay that'll work yep solved in side the lock box are twelve are inside the lock box our aid to Rose Soto in total it looks like there were spaces for twelve chocolates of which 3 have been eaten can I eat as a gaseous form I just really no I attempt to eat a chocolate you cannot eat as chocolate I come out of you cannot eat chocolate as gas I come out of the lock box and I go it's chocolate and I'm gonna start floating around the room looking for a whole bowl or like that sort of place where she could have gone okay I used my invisible mage had to unlock or pick the lock on the lock box okay inside are ten chocolates I said ten the first time right nine nine Charles yeah yeah are nine chocolates I so there's only three chocolate caramel there's one that has a c4 caramel to that arm in smoothies 1c salt chocolate ones coconut oh you don't know they're they're kind of an assorted one this almond there's a various assorted chocolates I want chocolate so you eat one of the mint ones okay you eat one of the mint mint chocolates okay you can make a wisdom saving from I like that we just walk into your office and just start like drinking or wine eating or chocolates nothing bad will happen okay you feel like for a moment you were going to get Warped and there's a flash sebastien making our kana check 23 the chocolate is magical there's conjuration magic on the chocolates an eating one casts dimension door but its destination is predetermined are they paired up no way of knowing they're not it's dark in there yeah if I know anything about par golds there's always a little symbol is there the kind of thing hidden under did someone lose know what I'm eating so frustrating but I don't you don't you you resisted the the can you forcibly dimension close it and put it in my bag can we perp can't can you just as a side question can I like willingly fail save me throws from yes you could willingly fail so we could also just eat the same chocolate they might all go to different places I mean that's we eat the same chocolate how about no all the chocolates are different I want you to like scrunch through all the papers and Scrolls around to see if there's any indication okay going through the papers and Scrolls are all sorts of notes and most of them you can see that on this table are notes that are dossiers and each of them are labeled and have notes of information on members of the hooded lanterns members of the amethyst Academy notes about you members of various members of the like basically one of the piece of papers you look it up and there's a sketch and it's you and it's a whole bunch of things

that have been written down about Elias Drexel there are things have been written down about a philia read there's things there's basically notes in here about almost everybody my gosh what's right most of them are focused on the people's mannerisms how they behave in social situations how they act the ways that they normally speak and talk who they normally talk to people that they know on a first-name basis like basically notes about how to impersonate that person and and in some cases like there's there's notes about like things that are now known about about them or are things think things about them as a reminder just I think we need to keep in mind that she may have recently drank from this gaseous form potion right yeah so she could have escaped from somewhere so we can clean this out or do we want to keep pursuing Monica I'm still floating around looking like I I want you should you should let the wind take you to see if there's like a breeze or like a vent that like

families get out thank you be safe I'm just gonna Eldrick says that we're gonna make forever wood village fine Ritter that's take thank you lanterns tell them a command from their commander stay with you and put their lives first before protecting the barracks and take the food you want the you want us to abandon the barracks I want you to go where safest so if that means abandoning the barracks then do it if you're not gonna stay there and help them fortify it they need to get it no matter we need to make an answer Eldrick and I can either head back to the Academy ourselves or we will come with we will go with the hooded lanterns if they're going to go back to Everwood village we can all if Eldrick and I are going to go going back through the city with a group of people including the civilians that are here they're not gonna make it we don't have enough supplies to get them through the hate through the the haze or on the tower the only place we could take everybody would be outside the city again then head there get them out their lives come first Ansem says we could we could go back to the silver orders camp and ask for shelter there that's the closest safest place they're not on good terms with us and they will cause a ruckus regardless of what our relationship was with them before it's not the same as before I feel like the Lord Commander I feel like being prisoners of war might be better than rat food but not if we can get to ember wood village and set that as our place of camp we Ansem says Lord Commander the silver order probably won't let Lenoir stay at the camp Kinnelon or come to the Academy Eldrick and River was a pause on the line and Elric says and River says we can bring Lenoir to the Academy but no one else that's fine get Lenoir to the Academy get the rest of the lanterns out Tambor would village okay it's done I heard are those rats we feel slightly responsible I may have made an error in judgment a few months ago that's coming back to it's not on us son it's on that demon I mean it's a little on us okay yeah to be honest yeah it's kind of on us the demons like part like the the ogre things those are that's on the demon but the rest of its on us we always knew that the rattling is wanted to conquer the surface we just didn't have the means they didn't have the means and now they have the means because that demon yeah cuz we sent them to a house with a demon statue because we thought that what's the worst that could happen as some idiot said well it turns out the worst view already is to keep the men and women of the hood and lanterns alive so as we one come near the bottle at all No okay has a bottle moved no guys we have a queen to deal with and then we have to deal with the rats let's finish what we came here maybe we could use her help I don't know what I'm saying I think my family's in danger mine too all of our sir in danger we've released some kind of plague on the city and you think queen of thieves is gonna help us become not in danger well she has investment look at how much she cares about the royal family she cares about the difficulties of letting the queen of the--of survive if we get all of the badges that she has we can control the walls of dragon high maybe we can take back the city yeah okay are you with me to the end let's kill a queen okay the the Rope trick ends you are back in the room there are the two warded doors the throne the empty bottle the glass and the table and all the lovely lovely art how the bottles not empty it's full of sodium pick a door do I detect any or did I detect when I first came in here any magic on these tourism ok can you left Sebastian what you know about do you have your portable alchemy kit yes how hard is it to brew this concoction what the gas form my calculations it just glasses it would it would I start like flipping through my journal it's gonna it would say it would take a bit a little bit i between like a minute and 40 minutes cool hour maybe even four hours it's big different round there with the right ingredients that you would find it looks I would be difficult the empty room I think I picked that door the one that she said left so okay open it up but there's there's a word on it our left or your left okay um can we stand back a little bit okay a chance you open the door the room is this room opens up and you look up at the ceiling and there are skylights and there are windows in this room you're deep underground but there's these big beautiful windows looking out onto onto it's like you're in a country house and you look at the windows you're in the Hills you see the rolling forest and in the distance you see the city of Drakon Haim but it's like it was 15 years ago this room looks completely out of place in this whole place it's like a bedroom in an estate in a country house in the hills with mahogany wood beautiful bay windows great drapes a beautiful fireplace and a noble's bed with the awning over top and there is a doorway that leads into a walk-in closet with a private water closet it is an immaculate bedroom suitable for a princess I want to smash these windows no sign of her there are there's no sign of her there is a desk that has what looks to be a stack of spell books and several arcane components neatly stacked beside it well you put your hand on one of the spell books it's different from the rest the spell books are labeled they are the spell books of Archmage's did you get these one is the spell book that is labeled works of lana Archmage and Lenna 'the Eventide volume seven this is this different than the spell book I have yes all of that like one of them is is the the works of Audrina Madera and one is the the works of wrath mode are and there volumed as you know one of the responsibilities for Archmage's of the amethyst academy is that during their tenure they are expected to produce editions of their personal spell book they Archmage's generally only produce a handful of these books over the course of their tenure and they are amongst the most valuable spell books in the entire world I take them and I put them in my back yep wait what are some of the names wrath mode are letteth Eventide and a drama mode era yes we're going in the other door Oh check I checked the closet actually inside the closet are about the closet opens up and it stretches back with two rows for about a hundred feet there are hundreds of pieces of clothing in here of every pot armor masks there is and then there is an incredible standing Butler and at the end of the and then at the end of the Wardrobe are several mirrors and a big desk with an entire set of makeup prosthetics like everything that you would need to completely change like hair dyes there's a bath tub everything I start to wreck it I start to just go bananas on this closet I walk over and I slowly close the door and let you I'm just like she's blowing off some steam yeah it's fair yeah I took some time and I like I rip every piece of clothing I destroy her desk destroying everything would actually take a long time yep I'm gonna take some time well she's doing that is there a fireplace right Oh some of these outfits are really fashionable yeah and like all the clothes are like gender like clothing that would fit people of any body type like and as you go through them like there's a bunch of different like there's fat suits and masks of different kinds like all all sorts of like it is like the most incredible like costume shop yeah and I'm sold in stores so angry I'm so angry that like she has gotten away that she has done this she's taking people's lives and I just start to I mean I probably can't get through the whole closet I probably cool off a little bit by then but I start at the desk and I just start ripping through it I'd like to check out this fireplace should be it's a beautiful fireplace with a warm fire burning in it the fire is not is is warm but it is magical the windows are also magical their permanent illusions and the light in here is caused by an illusion effect the fire the warmth is artificial but warm and there is and the only other thing that you find in here is there is a decanter and a glass of water and it's a decanter of endless water joint kleptomaniac eNOS is I'm taking the Astra can you turn off the fire I I splashed the decanter on the fire mm-hmm does it go by the fire set by the fire there is a bowl and a spoon take the spoon and I stick it in the bowl super pierce I come out of the closet it's delicious I smell I'm like what is this and I take the whole bowls oh that's so good really filling in fact like you're feel full that never happened I go back into the closet i I don't know why so this is a magic bowl and spoon and once per day when you put the spoon in the bowl it fills up with your favorite soup Oh No Bears never coming back to drive tonight it's the bowl of bowl of soup the bowl of endless Super Bowl of endless soup once per day when you put the spoon the bowl it conjures up your favorite soup and it's not it is perfectly nutritious and healthy and it is enough to provide all the food that you need for one day the seafood you know bisque is there anything suspicious about this fireplace like I'm like really looking hard at like I'm like trying to find if there's any switches or look around there's no chimney the fire is a continual flame spell that's radiating enough heat to keep the room pleasant but it's just the light it's just light but no passages there's no looking around making an investigation check 21 very conclusively there's no passages that are in here guys let's try the other door let's go to the other room all right I come out of closet like okay we go to the other day outside the other door but smashing here it opens up yeah and inside are seven massive chests labeled is this another riddle I made and the first one closest let's stand out the outside is yelling at the door hmm I'm a 10 the first one it's filled with gold I'm a chain the second one filled with gold all of them we're all filled with gold there's probably close to 50,000 gold pieces record-holding old but Sebastian as you look at it with your true sight I know your truth it's off it's been more time yeah it's like an hour right okay well I guess I forgot I activate the true site one last time all the gold or rocks they've been disguised as an illusion they're all gonna fit it's just fake money so she's not here yeah I'm glad I just look around the room go back into the other room and look in the I'm like the frantically looking everywhere like I'm I'm getting frustrated Sebastian is joining in with feyo's frustration he's ripping things off the wall yeah the only other thing the again the one room contains seven chests filled with fake gold the other is the bedroom with the illusionary windows and the and the closet in the bathroom and then there's the octagonal chamber with the artwork the throne and the the table with the glass on it I'd go out and I say somebody I was just about to say after Sebastian gets tired of ripping things apart he slumps down in the throne he slumped down on the throne and there is a flash of arcane energy as all the flesh is stripped off Sebastian's body leaving only a skeleton behind and that is where we're gonna end tonight Oh No thank
