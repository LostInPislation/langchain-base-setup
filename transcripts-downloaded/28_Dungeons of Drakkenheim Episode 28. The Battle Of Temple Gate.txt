they had ventured back to the barracks of the hooded lanterns meeting with the commander of the hooded lanterns and the night captain of the silver order to discuss the forthcoming attack at temple gate which will be happening tomorrow in the universe tonight catching up to speed with many of the members of the hooded lanterns and the Lord Commander and the night captain our heroes have concocted a plan together with them that will see the hooded lanterns and the silver order working together in a pincer strike to take temple gate which has been under the control of vicious Noel's for years perhaps this will be the staging ground for the hood lanterns in the silver order to charge deeper forth into the city perhaps one day to retake the grand Cathedral at the heart of Dragon hime nevertheless our heroes have been a little bit conflicted over which of the different factions they've they wish to support and follow through with which they discussed at length last time as well as discussing with Ophelia read the flame keeper the uncertain fate of Queen Lenore and speaking of Queens on the eve of battle our heroes have been visited by none other than the queen of Thieves or so who has taken the place of Alina Krieger one of the hooded lanterns royal guards swapping out for rolf wagner the other captured hooded Lantern visiting our heroes she pauses for a moment in this hooded Lantern form it says I'm gonna keep a close eye on you all as this goes forward in the attack tomorrow don't worry I'm not gonna get involved just don't blow my cover for me okay sure turn it do we have a choice what if we do well be a bit of a setback but I think that we can have a more positive relationship with each other than that hmm after all some of my boys really like you and blackjack Mel decided to send a little bit more of his old family recipe and she produces another jar of the vial appointment that blackjack Mel had shared with you previously the via the this jar is absolutely brimming with this thick sound like ointment that you can spread on yourselves listen Queen I'm taking the jar but that doesn't mean we're friends but thank you well I'm disappointed I thought I was going to give this to you as well and she produces around her neck an amulet but it's not one that you've seen before but it is a golden chain and on it are hanging two glowing rubies did I say we weren't friends that's something that he's backwards on customary tracking hi yeah I got confused why not friends friends it's it's Sebastian just goes first first instinct sometimes and what we're saying is meet the moment to think about we want more things you can buy my love fantastic everyone has a price and it's good that I know yours I think you'll have a little bit of a ball with this one she says spinning in the route just don't be this reckless with it it's rather explosive yeah my feeling but nervous as you're doing this to be honest I am feeling excited she grasps the chain there used to be more rubies on this one but once in a while you need to blow something up I took your nice little bomb from you but consider these a bit of a practice room we do like blowing things up to be honest hey is this to see if we're good with bombs sort of like are we I'm very interested to see what kind of destructive tendencies you actually have I'll be watching to see what's what happens with these what she hands you is a necklace of fireballs with two orbs on you can detach one of the rubies to throw it do launch a fireball try not to get killed we've got some big plans add well I haven't died yet it's always the goal is to survive regardless of plans well we'll see you next time good luck oh man she just she's around and I don't like her and she gives us stuff and I'm kind of okay with her ultimately we're not friends with her is she still here I don't know did she leave instead of waving my arms behind me into the to see if maybe she's just visibles okay okay now we can plan to kill her she's not around we need to we need she needs to die she needs to die sooner I mean actually I don't know maybe maybe we I don't know if I've made up my mind yet I'm whether uh well okay well she is scary though there is something that we need to do right now we need to tell them not to interrogate Wagner go oh yeah we were wrong about Rolf yep uh well no we can say he like he's been back he was captured that's not wrong but he's back now we just got a message that we were wrong where's Petra Petra if we go in and there's like he's chained up in the thing and he's got the hood on his head and he's getting like beat up after a short amount of time you are able to track down Petra and she she turns to you and says did you find her in the the main hall of the barracks looking rather stressed and quite conflicted over the situation with the Magnar you find her in the hall and she says we've apprehended it vogner he's down in the cells below he doesn't seem to know what's going on yeah you can release him our information was it was correct up until two seconds ago recently what's changed well he was returned yeah um and we received a message that he's not the same spy and unfortunately now that kind of leaves us at a dead end when it comes to we get a message from how did you get a message in here the queen of Thieves gave us a message yeah wait what how how did she get in here I don't know if she's still here is she hiding did she sneak in possibly it looks like she snuck in she might still be around her here um probably not though I'm gonna be honest yeah she probably lost she she got out but she brought Wagner Wagner Wagner back vogner she brought him back accent and has replaced and like take it she's taken somebody else and did she take I don't know I can't remember names so you mean to say that the queen of thieves has replaced one of our soldiers yes not replaced like taken I know who's brought back the one that she had took another one it could be anybody could be just just know that at any time she could be and I do the way behind my head again she could be like anywhere always you could be the queen of Thieves for all we know you could be your majesty are you the Queen can you proceed with the attack the case oh she's not gonna bother we have we have it on reliable she wants it she wants this to happen she's this is a huge problem luckily the Lord Commander did say that him and the knight commander we're gonna go through and zone of truth all of the members of their groups to try to find out if there was a mole I'm gonna take day yeah that might not happen before the battle yeah she probably happened after though like immediately after this is a disaster I'm a dragon huh it might be better to keep this between us Petra to not worry the higher command it might just add more stress or more concern the battle should go off as needed but just know that going forward she might be right behind you make a persuasion check seven I don't think I can keep this information from our commander no it's really good I'm not good at lying but he is if you tell the Lord Commander now you know what the Lord commanders like it's gonna throw him off his whole game we have a really important battle tomorrow we're leaving right and early in the morning to go to war against knowles we can't have the lord commander stressing about something else he needs to be focused on this battle okay give me one more persuasion check doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo 14 I can't hide this information from the Lord Commander I know it's gonna stress him out and it's gonna freak him out but I need to do my duty what if you tell him after the battle it's not saying that you have to not tell him I think we should tell him but I think that the battle is more important to the safety of tracking him I can't keep critical information from my commanding officer what if you tell me about that hide this information from My Father what if we found out who the real spy was and we told you would that make you feel better we've got a lot to prepare for for tomorrow you think you can find out who it is between now and then I think we can give me a deception check we know who it is 14 I don't I don't think you're gonna be able to do that we we found ralph didn't we Ralph there's a whole other ballgame I have to tell the local commander I'm sorry well you know I I don't mind if you tell the Lord Commander but we'll find the spy so that way it's not a worry for the battle tomorrow and you can assure him of that what I don't know about that do our best best okay come on I'm mad badger we go way back everybody everything's in position to get going first thing in the morning if you want to spend all night looking through the castle interrogating all the soldiers and trying to find out who this is it's gonna send a panic through the ranks I have to tell the commander but so that he knows in case there's a problem for morale but if you go go through this whole place kind of pull up everyone's skirts figuring out who is a spy and who's not that's gonna wreck the morale of everybody here you can't do that give us one hour can you can the commander wait to act on this information he's going to have because I think if we leave the morale we do the battle and then we can set in doing the work of finding who it is I mean you never know they might just die in the battle I have to tell the Lord Commander because if there's a problem during the battle tomorrow he needs to know that this is a possible reason why no that's I understand Petra if you give us one hour before you tell them maybe we can go with better news to say yes there is a new spy but we also found them I'm sorry but no I'm telling you now okay oh I think it's best and she takes her leave I was gonna like why I was just gonna sacrifice someone hopefully it was just to like grab a random person be like yeah they're the spy we know who the spies I know but we don't want to give it away either because we're working for the Queen again but we also want her to die it's really confusing really toxic relationship super toxic I just don't want her here anymore we're all gonna need therapy so war tomorrow and spice a night and I think we should rest somehow if we're gonna be going into battle we're gonna need as much rest as these soldiers we're probably gonna be doing all the heavy lifting when it comes to the the gate I'm gonna be putting some cool spells into my my ring oh good idea that's right and uh that should give us a little bit more oomph tomorrow oh how much oil and did we get from a full jar of five doses good I'll be rubbing that during battle and don't forget to use the old one before you use the new one it's so frustrating when you open the new one like finish the old one ones fresh look what would you like to do now beyond casting the spell isn't doing anything else art do you want to truck like my whole play was to either just be like yeah it turns out it was Ralph and then he denies denies denies but at least they can it can bias time till tomorrow and then the core commanders not to worry or we just throw someone out sacrificially into the pit oh I don't think like at this point we're doing a lot for both sides of this party going in let the little lanterns deal with this for now we have other things we need to focus on and think about like think about getting into the the Cathedral yeah they know about the spy they can handle their biz not every problem needs to be our problem I'm focusing on the war tomorrow we told Petra Petra is going to bring it up to the higher commands and we're gonna do what they're gonna do and we're just here to make sure that that gate stays open tomorrow we won't survive under the weight of all dragon homes problems so let's focus on the ones that we can lift with one hand this is super pillar I'm Roy creme brulée creme brulee a lot of weight off my shoulders that's because you're not wearing your armor oh that's where's my husband as you in your room thank you as you take your time to prepare about an hour and a half later the Lord Commander shows up and he says I received word from Petra about vogner and our friend the queen of Thieves I've had a long conversation with vogner asked him about his orders of the past couple days and all I can tell you is this someone has done something to his mind it doesn't he has strange and incomplete recollections of the past several weeks gaps of information fragments of memories like someone's been up and down and in through his head rearranging the order of events he remembers things like he was watching them not like he was really there all I can conclude from this and from what you've told me is that we have vastly underestimated the Queen of Peace we feel that way to the one benefit that we might have is that we might know what she wants but this is not something we can really act on right now what do you think she wants the badges of tracking her right I think that it's best that we go through with the battle tomorrow there's no ifs ands or buts about that we need to take that gate once we hold the gate I think that it might be good if we maybe try to track down some more of those badges before the Queen gets her hands on them and maybe try to see if there's a way that we can use that to plot against the Queen I don't know yet I'm still kind of figuring it out run some interference even on her plans yeah if we can get those badges that should be I think our next course of action because not only will that help with the queen of Thieves it also helps us control the walls and get into castle dragon very well if something goes wrong there'll be a signal if there's an unexpected interloper tomorrow we're going to retreat what's the signal we have our war horns this means that once you go in there's a problem there's interference we're not going to be able to come and get you well are you expecting interference from the Queen because we have assurances I don't know how valuable those are but assurances that she's not going to get in the way of that I'd be a fool if I wasn't expecting it I agree it's good plan but I'm moving forward with the assumption that something is going to go wrong and I'm going to have to pull out my soldiers okay I mean that's awesome istic to the plan but if we have to retreat I'm not spending lives on a situation that we no longer control agreed what about the paladins I have discuss plans for a retreat with the night commander with the night captain my hope is that if the queen of thieves does interfere the silver order will bear the brunt of that problem I would rather than not know that we've been compromised okay I'm perfectly willing to spend the lives in a few illyrians before before any of my own the night captain is a good man but I would rather spend my because I would rather than lay down their lives than any my people in tents gonna be a cold day in Drakon home it's always pretty you know damn yeah it's trying to be traumatic nevertheless in the morning you are to report to him and you'll be joining his unit we're gonna get that gate open I know that you're planning for problems but when you see that gate open you get in there as fast as possible not you but you know your men your men will be we're gonna be right on top of them the moment you go in there's gonna be hundreds of Knolls there and they're going and as soon as they realize that you've got it infiltrated on top the more of a distraction we can be the better but we will be ready to run if we need to get some sleep good luck food first then sleep should we have not told anyone I think that's what I learn from this it's I don't know I don't know it's really hard you know like I I tried being like lying and secretive a lot and that got me nowhere so now I'm trying to be open with the lord commander because we're agreeing that we should trust them and now we're having to be more lying and more secretive no we gave him the information he's just the one that has to deal with it but then like we also like that's true and we're okay so we lie to the guy tomorrow no we didn't lie we just didn't tell everything because our lives are on the line yeah I don't know I'm nervous right now we're though I just I'm trying to do what's right a little bit of lying that's you jack my big takeaway is that we what's right we should just keep we have to keep more to ourselves maybe yeah maybe but then they're lying killed Ralph I would rather more people against the Queen yeah geez I would rather have more people know that she's a threat because then maybe when it comes time to deal with that issue we have more people on our side and her power is is the shadows right is the unknowns is you know putting on the face that you don't know and getting the information if the more information that we can share about her the less power that she'll have right she may be steps ahead but we're just putting ourselves at more of a disadvantage if we don't show the information we know okay come on to a point you guys want to have a nappy nap and get ready for a big day of battle all right let's do a sleepover with all our heads in the middle as I'm eating like a turkey leg and we're looking up but though we have our oldest seems like no no we just have to come we have to yeah okay and it's mostly just a muffle your screams no I don't scare anymore I have a dog he's my dog he's my nightmare dog he's my real life dog now you just all this time you just wanted a dog as are you screaming I didn't I never heard that when I screamed oh god a dog now it's just the snoring though to medical with a no imitation of tomorrow's battle you're able to get some rest in and at the crack of dawn the sound of the horns of the hooded lanterns in the silver order awake you as the troops begin to mobilize I'm still sleeping in five more minutes five more minutes hey you got to get up where you have to kill like probably a hundred Knolls each today wow that's a lot I bet you I could do before you Pluto [Laughter] [Music] are we are we are we gonna keep count yeah let's go I'm I'm I'm gonna help both of you guys do the killing but yeah let's I'm down cracked my knuckles I'm like all right it's um it's a friendly friendly bet let's see how many knows we can kill and then try to beat that record in the same day I would like some white tuna on like [ __ ] please oh wow so fancy and if Pluto wins your prints you gonna put it you have to scratch my back four in a row I need to feel again yeah I want because like this armor sometimes it gets really hot and like it gets yeah I just I mean if you want to do is any time I'd probably give unto you but sure oh you know and I want and I'm putting a 10 gold on Vail food is a motivator you know alrighty so as you leave the barracks suited up all equipped the night captain and as there were several fresh horses and he says all right you're riding with me so I figure I've got a lot of good good riders my Griffins but one of you three is gonna ride with me and ROM win tonight and you're gonna go with two of my best we're gonna get you in as close we can so we have to pick who rides with you I guess I'll go I'll go yeah okay okay I'll go always this is the night-night captain is he going on is did he mention a horse or was that his Griffin's name his name his horse no cool she's uh she's rooster just out with with the front lines and the others you'll be riding with then we'll have you ride with Wyatt you'll be with Landry they're two of my best riders we'll get you in as close we can but word is they got some big big crossbows up on the tops of them towers so we're gonna have to get out as soon as possible how far did you say that you could throw yourself I can go 300 feet approximately that's the furthest I've ever been able to teleport so far wait King yeah what's the range on thunder step under step or is it yeah Thunder Oh Thunder can be heard from 300 feet away never mind that's what I read 90 feet oh no oh no I've misinterpreted all right so we're gonna have to get you in pretty close that's fine what's it so could it still count though if we came from higher and then we fall a little bit and then you Thunder step or is that gonna be the we've we've been over that little cool factor on that is so high that it's so worth it and I can we kind of like drop in and like count and then down or are we gonna get that force damage from falling falling you know the Lord commanders advise me to not get to directly high over the city walls because of our little friends that tend to fly off the walls I might have an idea to get us close it's not going to be great but it might work and Pluto I'm sorry why you get us as close as possible I'll get some darkness going around us that way we're harder to hit as we rush forward you guys will probably need to like I don't know tie rope to me and you'll both hold the rope and like come with me through the darkness and I'll get us as close as I can drop the darkness and teleport us well teleport vayo and you'll need to use your own teleport to get in okay so you don't want to fly with us no I do but you were worried about getting that close can you get us 90 feet can you get a sign on to the wall or no we can try but the close of the we're gonna be wrestling with two things first all the rest of our boys are gonna be going in on foot we got some cavalry coming through as well in the first wave but they're gonna be fighting their way to the wall as quickly as they can because as soon as you get on that wall you're gonna be the number one target for every single Knoll in the whole area unless we get close enough to drive them off so our hope is that they're gonna be preoccupied with you preoccupied with us you're gonna be able to get in there as fast as you can and get that gate open how close do you think you can get us how close do you want to risk it I can get you in 90 feet I can get you closer you get us a hundred feet out I'm sure I can run ten feet yeah actually you can even get us like 120 feet or what what am I saying Ludo do some math yeah we're gonna be flying we're yeah we're gonna be we're not gonna land the idea is for you to and how tall is the wall the gate itself oh you're not landing so we are doing the jump we won't be able to land there that there's a bunch of Knowles camped right out in front of the gate if we land they're gonna be all over us so we're back to the jump idea you got no other way okay we've got goals for all of us I feel like my eyes are gonna get real dry falling this guy of dragon mountain I only have one parent sorry you have any flying goggles we can help you out yeah can we make some sort of contraption that can slow our fall like a giant parachute like yeah like a big wind catcher to float down to safety we're just gonna teleport it's gonna be okay or maybe a series of traps each more elaborate cape don't you just blow down that how it works science writer but I will try it today I guess we can just you have to get the closest are you gonna go with Mayo you worried about your magic causing some backlash it will it will it's loud you're gonna hear it when I teleport these are gonna hurt if you're within close proximity to me which is why I'm gonna have to jump off the Griffin how bad how Bad's are gonna hurt a lot of lightning yeah it's there's there some thunder there's some lightning you just want to wrap your wings you're riding with me and Rob we've been rhyme wind and I can handle it little turbulences we're no strangers to a little turbulence I can jump he wants to jump all right that's my I'll ride with you if you want a good smile but I will also I will need to grab veo as well which is why we're both gonna have to jump well could I go with ya yes exactly either oh I guess yeah as long as you guys are but are you gonna get close to each other well we can be further away and then as long as the Griffins they're all Griffin's right yeah as long as I jump on well I can can you how far can he go Oh 500 feet that's way better well then Sebastian doing the death ain't no risk nothing ventured nothing gained I'll fly you forward myself me and laundry will be fine and veo and you guys can probably get dropped off like 500 feet away basil port in I'm gonna have to Ariel so we'll listen for the clap yeah so as soon as I hear the explosion well we need to be within 300 feet then I'm gonna clap right yeah they're gonna teleport into our and we're all gonna go to the same place and where are you going won't know until I get there you can see it don't worry yeah we can we can maybe the right the right tower yes at the right tower the left tower where's the gate opening mechanism from what I understand Lord Commander tells me it's on both towers one tower opens the front portcullis the other tower opens the back port colors you guys want to do left or right first we're talking for both sides either way and as well we're not going in there until both are open there's murder holes down the middle line so when you go in there you need to make sure that if there is anybody and in there that's gonna be dumping anything nasty on us that they're dead okay yeah my only thing is now do we need two strong people to open up these gates I thought there was only one yeah well we're gonna it's the same no matter what that doesn't change the plan we just have to jump to both towers it's just that well the once they open once we open it yeah that's our thing like once we open it does it stay open or do we have to like unless anyone goes to close it okay so we need to you so sorry this was not clear in the plans that we laid out I thought there was one switch so we're supposed to defend the open gates but now there's two gates that need to be open and we need to defend both hopefully you can keep at least the front one open and keep the route clear and get the second one open if you get them open for us and there's nothing in there that's gonna kill us while we're in there you can take as much time as you need if one if one is open but not the other that's fine as long as we can get in the front first so focus on the front kill anything that's around survive then open second gate one there sir comeback party yeah that sound correct there better be a buffet when we see the front gate open I'm gonna order my man to charge if that front gates open and the second gate isn't they'll hold their own as best they can but if there is anybody in the bin the murder holes above we're gonna be in for import so I think we go in we clear out as much as we can first and then we open the front gate so that they can charge in and take care of whatever is left we need to make sure that any defenses they have like ballistas or crossbows like anything up there you said that they might be pouring stuff on you you mention that now is that a time tic that they we use here in Dragonite I get like I mean yeah okay oh it is a fortress yeah and we you know we don't know how smart those Knolls are about siege defense but if it was me yeah we'd have cauldrons of boiling oil okay we'll take care of it so many things anything else before we go to our potential deaths well I hope you're not gonna die but I hope so too yeah it's a big hope not likely though hasn't happened yet we're gonna give you a signal horn to grab okay now if things are going bad okay you can't gives you the horn widow do you want now one of you you want taking one solid okay one solid blare on the horn we hear that that's our signal that it's not going good Oh is there any other signals like two or three once you got it once you're ready for us - quick blasts okay got that one times horn bad two times for Incred yes one two okay right Pluto yeah yeah final thing I should know you're gonna be beat up no you're gonna be hurt hmm I bought a wave of match troops that as soon as we can get to you as soon as we get to you we're gonna get a flame keeper - ten - yeah it's nice so what you're saying is fight as hard as we can as long as we can yeah and we will be tended to well we're gonna get you out of there as soon as we can what if a retreat is called I'll fly down there myself and get you okay mmm oh my gosh bravery I'm so honored yeah yeah I wouldn't do that well only for you to though do you have do you have any like can I get a flame thrower I'd be happy to give you one have yet but we need to teach you how to use it proper oh yeah I thought it was just like a point-and-click sort of this scenario but if you feel more about making sure you don't blow yourself up that's fair maybe we're leaving if I survive I want to try if I survive I would love to learn how to use it or any other gifts you have they also generally don't put them on the Griffins why not that's pretty smart relax turkey but yeah I guess all right Ari so I'm me and me and they are gonna fly in I'm not gonna land about 300 feet out you know it makes more sense I was gonna bring veo just because I was scared right now now I'm gonna go solo I'm gonna you guys better be right behind me if i teleport in there and you guys aren't there I'm good I mean your Lord Commander says that the North Tower should be the one that opens the front gate so let's go there first the North Tower North Tower and it's on the yep and you're not and and and we're pretty sure we're like a 90 out of 100 who else would know that's true well try it used to be the captain of the guard of the city so I'm gonna trust him on that hopefully the towers are close enough were even if it is the wrong one we can swap over I'll cook and if it's he says if it's anything like any of the other gates you should be able to get from one to the other inside oh yeah okay there we go I'll just have to kill everything on our way done resent note yep with that he leads you out to the lines where the silver order have amassed almost every man and woman under arms has taken up positions on temple road where there are six large oxen pulling a Hugh seadragon several other members of the silver order have assembled and they are carrying siege ladders and other equipment with them and a few others are carrying Rams in case they need to break down the portcullis themselves they have large Palisades to use as cover as they wheel themselves forward and several dozen of them are mounted on horseback as well ready for a cavalry charge to go forward the Lord Commander leads you up to where him and his personal unit the all the Gryphon riders are together and what stands out most is that the Lord commanders Griffon lives up to her name because rhyme wind is a blue Griffon and even and as you see this Griffon there are bits of what almost looks like snow and ice dropping off of its wings it's seen it doesn't seem like it's as large as the other Griffins but something but there's something very unique about this creature as if it's been touched by some sort of elemental nature to it very fitting mount for a commander of the silver order you're gonna get to go right on this I make cooing noises to are like I do my pigeons like yeah even as its as its wings flap it's almost like the Lord Commander the the night captain himself is born on silver wings with the kind of blue silver tinge of the Griffon the others are astride several Griffins that all of them have been armored so each Griffin has like this fitted breastplate that leaves its wings full and then a little bit of extra harnesses and everything you can see that all of them have actually got a attach to the front of this breastplate that all the Griffins are wearing is a chain that then dangles around onto the saddle and the riders themselves have a harness on their backs that their their breastplate and armor itself is on a chain as well so if they're knocked off their mouths do we get harnessed in what as they do work they see what they have is a harness that's similar to as if you're doing an assisted parachute jump so you are instead of you being behind the rider like you normally would be on a horse they have you in front of the the main rider and then you're kind of like clipped on to them on us on a second harness am I gonna be okay to unclip myself and drop that that's what they explained like though they talk you through how the clips work and how to unclip yourselves and that's great I think now you normally never want to do this mid-flight now you'd normally never ever do this but we're doing it this time good we have all these safety measures ignore all of them and Wyatt and landry are like we can we'll be able to fly in close so that the two of you can hold hands to Dimension Door forward all right I keep calling them laundry and I'm doing it on purpose um thanks laundry I take my goggles that I get from them and I'm like Allah give me my goggles woman I'm a woman move in with my babbles oh you're not even are you making fun of me like a human mocking I'm a half oh you know that right I really I'm a happy woman okay thank you for making fun of me now let's the way the there are other ways all the the Griffin riders are much more lightly armored they're all kind of armored in the in the front but they have like a leather jerkin underneath it gives a much more mobility on on the saddle and then they all wear this leather skullcap that's lined with fur on the inside that has these big flaps over their ears and then a big pair of goggles that they can each pull down so it gives them kind of the the nightlight visor that they can pull over their faces but it's more of leather and glass rather than then metal I mean then they they put them on and that the leather headdress still has this plume coming off the top of it well Pluto I'll see on the rooftop see on the other side man take care of yourself you take care of yourself too and don't forget there cuz I forgot make sure you get there not saying that you won't just make sure because I'm gonna be up there alone and I'm scared fine you'll be fine creme brulee you got this you know you'll be there take life by the creme brulee and I'ma be there I mean you should get there oh you gotta get closer than we do so we gonna be there yeah i'ma be there I'll be there for you jaqen forest will dragons come together already it's faded that's the worst thing they they pull you onto the Griffons saddle you up and kick off into the air and the the as they they do so the night captain goes out and addresses the soldiers and he says all right y'all they're the flame for the lat give all your hearts we'll see you on the other side it's time to burn some barbecue burns for the rat prints with that they kick to the sky and there's a cheer from the Silver order and the loud horn signals the unique ones that they've done to signal the hooded lanterns on the other side with that there is a rush as the soldiers of the silver order surged forward spearheaded by the Calvary that heads down temple road to clear the pathway for the infantry going forward the night captain and the remove you take to the sky and from here you can see Drakken highness you really have never seen it before you've been used to hire purchase but seeing the city from high above it's almost like the gives you a different perspective on the the damage from this side although you have been up this high because you've been up the clock tower and whatnot ahead of you is temple gate and it is a large fortress gate Barbican style so what that means is that there's two towers that are flanking the gates itself that are then a joint the city wall goes into at this point the city walls themselves are about 40 feet high and then the fortress point of the towers reaches up to about 70 feet in height where the battlements are but then there's a second small tower that juts out at the top of the of each tower as well a smaller Tower coming off the top of each tower from this distance several thousand feet away you can only just make out signs of movement as the thunderous charge forward of the silver order is met with howls on the wind of the Noles beginning to assemble as the death dogs that dwell in this distant area catch sight of the charging soldiers and just this keening howl is set off across the entire area and you can see these black brown and grey furry bodies beginning to pour out from the ruined buildings in the area and rushing towards temple road as the silver order charges forward on their horses battle is met between the groups of them and a after a few moments after a few minutes it's very clear that a battle line is beginning to form some 200 feet off the walls of the city at this moment there are horn calls and howls that can be heard in the city as the hooded lanterns attack begins as well and the howls and yips of all the Noles throughout the area can be heard over the sound of battle drawn between all these forces many of the Noles eager for combat you can see that the walls themselves are quite lightly defended the Noles are more out in force on the city streets than anywhere else and as the silver order draws the battle line their cavalry holds back and you can and you see that they're mounting in the wings of the street waiting for their signal to charge forward towards the gate so are you ready well Lord Commander I've never done anything that's crazy in my life so yes let's go ahead he points out he says you can see a bunch of the Noles are all coming forward now they're gonna meet them in battle as soon as you get on that rooftop and you get that gate open we got our opening right there any points to where the roadway meets towards the gate we're gonna come through there as fast as we can we're gonna have that breach well we're not gonna have long so you do what you need to do make Knight captain can I ask you a question are you scared I've always been scared going into battle that's how you know that you care thank you I'm scared most I'm not scared I'll tell you I'm not scared for myself I've been ready to give my life so many times in my life I'm scared for after this is all over when I have to look across my soldiers and I have to see all the faces that aren't there anymore that's the thing that scares me most that's weird I'm scared to die but you know to each their own how close are we alrighty it's making friendly conversation I just wanted somebody to make me feel better he says to you now you pull yourself close in the roads rom wind the points ahead and he calls to his his his wingman those crossbows are gonna fire as soon as we get close so Kellogg and Sawyer are gonna come with me and hopefully all four of them don't shoot at me all at once because that's gonna hurt yeah it's not like you're flying a giant blue bird okay with that are you Wyatt Landry begins circling with the two of you ready for you to follow the sound of the thunderous crack which will be their signal for you so you're effectively readying your action to go forth and so yeah we're about like a little less than 300 feet away from the North Tower so that way as soon as we hear the bang we're going to the north steppin we steppin and how am i holding your hand my are we just like circling the whole thing yeah I don't know I think or can we just land the riders are basically ready to pull you in together because you guys are controlling your mouth the writers are ready to pull themselves in together and let you two join your hands at the moment so they're there their practice enough flyers that they can hold this kind of new growth that gets casual super cash it's not casual but they're ready for it yeah nothing's ever gone bad all right what's wrong with my fingers with that you flyff told us about you and as you fly forward Sebastian roll me to d6 and tell me the individual results of each I got a 5 and a 1 okay as you fly forward a barrage of bolts reach up from the crossbows that are that several nulls are manning you can see that there are knowles across the entirety of temple gate that are drawing out bows and beginning to fire individual arrows and as they see you flying forward they turn the pelisses up and start firing in and one of the ballista shots actually sales rate towards sebastian oh god oh god oh god oh god the heart gets a 12 versus your AC Sebastian no cuz my AC is 12 another ballista shot sails towards basically what happens is these two ballista shots sail forward the night captain holds the reins of rhyme wind and it dives down but forward and the the bolt basically because you're the one in front as it dives downward to evade another shot it almost puts your head in the path of the bolt and you pull the shield up into selected no the the night captain it was nice magic I like it me too several other shots ring out towards the other riders and one of the Griffins is hit by an arrow but it seems to survive by one of the bow shots of another arrow but the ballista shots all go wide as they they come forward and the the night captain as he pulls Ryan wind up he says now is your shot and he unhooks you you need a little bit of a push yep and he pushes you in the back off the mount I I take a few seconds so I'm falling in at first I'm just screaming like as loud as I can and then I realized that you know it's actually pretty cool and I have my goggles on and I kind of like level myself out so I'm doing like a free fall and then I pencil in so I start going like towards ya and then just as I get close enough about 90 feet I start yelling again and somewhere in there I yell my spell word for Thunder step which i think is just thunder so there's a sucking into the air and a crack of thunder and as as sebastian falls through the through the air wyatt and Landry say to each other looks like it's time and they circle in around each other and they kind of do this spin like two birds that are kind of spinning around each other get really really close and there's an awesome high-five and polluting as you pull the the cape of the mouth of a cow and the two of you vanish even pying stuff you've been delirium there's delirium shards in my and with that you can place yourselves on the North Tower and we can roll for initiative dimension door the one closer to God also I'm gonna I'm gonna use the ring Thunder staff that I had Oh for those of you don't know I put spells in my ring during right before I'm on rest what spells I put Thunder step and enlarge reduce okay nice and I just used the Thunder step Oh would it make more sense if we like both appeared somewhere different like if I was well me and Pluto active in same spot I kind of want to be a little time in dimension door it says that I can visualize like you arrive at exactly the spot desired it can be a place you can see when you can visualize or when you can describe I wonder could I like visualize beside Sebastian and just put that little trapdoor back on there okay oh here I am so we just all appear on the tower I'm so happy to see you guys holding for initiative oh yeah yeah we got I got a 14 okay 22:09 [Music] that's a nice spread right this is good because there you go first right okay so you of us you have all landed atop the castle tower of the fort I don't know with a loud pop you can hear the cry as the horns signal sound as the next wave of the silver order comes forward towards the fort and you can see that they push the Noles back and they're only about a hundred feet away now from the fortress proper as a wave of Knolls cut is embattled them and surrounding them on almost all sides but they continue to pull their siege cart forward on the other side from your position now you can clearly see that the hooded lanterns have also begun their attack and you can hear the sound of arrows being fired both from Knolls that are on the walls because below you you've landed on this tower and there's this one large Knoll it's got a single eye that's been kind of gout the other eye has been gouged across its face and it's furs matted and torn and it's barking orders down and cracking a whip down from up above at the Noles that are Manning the crossbows below several of the other knowles are preparing this boiling liquid that is glow a purplish green sort of color that's in these barrels that have all been stacked up on top here so two of the Noles are picking up this and pouring it into the cauldrons where they're starting to set fires to boil it it's only been a few minutes and so the Noles are clearly scrambling to respond to the situation and they're tackling as they pour this liquid into the cauldrons around them you can see also that it looks like something has taken up position inside the towers themselves because below you the air arrows are firing out of the arrow slits as well now to the and finally as you land on position on the the top of this tower you can see that within the kind of pile in the mess of of all the barrels and knotted kind of it looks like the Noles have kept several nests up here matted fur for various furs but what you realize is that that's not the nest there's a creature in this nest and it looks up at you it's a Manticore warily yep what that's a pro recon a hurry conference not good enough nobody said anything about manticores nope don't you thing to kill I like that a new thing okay and a long list of things today oh you are up first start with a good old Zephyr strike in order to zip away plus with my feline agility I want to kind of I see the manticore I see the big guy and I say Pluto you take the big guy I got the manticore the back of the tower and take my three shots at the manticore okay can some of them be in the air so yeah it's all these shots in the air as I'm going in so I'll take my advantage on his every strike at the beginning Oh with a full 10 as the your arrow sails forward it collides into the stone work behind the manticore as it stretches out and begins to expand its wings I take my second shot Boop less than that okay okay third recover No so doing your cool backflip off the top of the tower you slide out it looked really cool but all the shots probably just like steady myself a name definitely warning shots but I probably have a Manticore that wants to eat my face right now so I hop over the side of the wall onto Bayard you want me to take the manticore like no no no I got it something like running away you're like don't worry I got this so I know you're running over there kind of just to but you need to know that there's another tiles on that tower yeah so I want to like balance myself on the middle okay yeah cuz I knew there was more over there but I'm like I want to start to like back away from this van of course oh my gosh okay so Kelly you can put those nulls on the other power for me this evenly spaced it okay so next up is actually the manticore Oh kicking back it swings the manticore flies into the air flying up 50 feet in the air from its current position as it does so it returns fire at you Vail firing its tail spikes at you hey getting a 19 a 21 and a 15 to hit all three hit okay all three okay it was it because we we switched to hide armor for a bit did you put back like your regular armor okay so all three tail spikes hit you the first one dealing for damage the second one five but the last one crashes into you for 11 points of damage oh this is a fun battle already we're having fun I'm having fun next up is Sebastian all right Sebastian clamors down and drops so you don't have a climb speed so I'm gonna have you make out how far of a drop is that it's a 20-foot girl that's a large drop why does that come up maybe just hang out I learn is there is a hatch I look over the ledge and I'm like I'm gonna jump I'm not gonna jump Pluto and then you look at you go to follow Baio because you take a cool jump so I'm like I'm gonna do it - oh no can i web something that's airborne or I need something to anchor the way I need something to anchor the webs on otherwise this spell just collapses next question is hypnotic pattern three-dimensional it is the manticore is 50 feet in the air that's fair I'm going to I yell veil do you still have the manticore cool if I have not a cotton while all of these guys see as well um if it's like Paul where do you want to you if the hypnotic pattern is a 30-foot cube so there's no way that you can get the manticore and any Knowles not the manticore these Knowles those for Knowles right there four five five yep you could get them all in one area okay so I I look over at Pluto and I'm like don't look it's gonna be weird again and again my eyes turn pure black and a bunch of shadows just start pouring out of my body and coalescing in the air around the Noles and they all look up at it and I'm the highest I get 116 but all the others get between 8 and 14 so one of them makes this save that okay so one others are all hypnotic pattern eyes so they will all be incapacitated yeah yeah just just knock them prone they're not actually prone but yeah well this guy's yes so good yeah nice anything else Sebastian um I moved behind Pluto okay next up are the nulls okay so several of the Noel's on the the ground below are not these girls are not in any position to fire up at you guys but the null over here catches sight of veil and the two of them twist around to to fire at you and they shoot you with their arrows now getting a natural one a 18 mm-hmm a 14 and a 13 one of those things one hits all righty that's gonna be a 10 damage for not shot so the two nulls turn around they take cover behind the the battlements and they fire fire their shots at you the Noles over here haven't quite caught on to what's happening over here but some of them do two of them do and they see Sebastian and Pluto at the top of the tower and they both fire one fires each of you but both of you have cover because of the battlements so both of you can add it's 3/4 cover so both of you can add five to your AC Oh baby so lit oh please don't print I know I know one more Knoll also fires two more shots at Vail getting a critical hits no mayo for pretty miserable crit for another ten are you okay man just like pork chops arrows pork chops for hogs and several the other Noel's rushed to the front of the battlements and begin firing down at the soldiers below just got beat on yeah I know I'm take care of it we have to kill that Manticore cool next up is boludo i am i based with big dude yeah hello [Music] shoot I guess I'm gonna pull out my sword and start stabbing them go for it stab stab look at that don't look I stabbed him again and that's better 25 that is a hit for 14 damage that actually leaves him bloodied oh wow as your blade Cleaves into the Noll slices through the through the side shoot and then yeah I'm gonna push him away okay pushing him away with my shield 27 I'm gonna give it an advantage because he's up against the castle walls didn't help are you pushing him off there when I push him off yeah okay I do that okay he falls 20 feet takes two points of a bludgeoning damage as you hear Oh wet as he lands on his head and breaks his neck with a red snap and then I think it is time can i still action surge yes I action surge I'm gonna pull up my javelin okay I'm gonna Huck it at the manticore Knights and I am going to Huck it and I get a 22 to hit that is a hit for eight no sorry six damage okay but then he needs to make a DC 16 strength check because I'm gonna try to trip him and you're in short range too cuz he's 50 feet up with the towers 20 feet high so you're gonna try it so I need to make a what saving throw uh can you trip if it's not a melee that's you can that's why I was frantically looking up 16 DC 16 strength strength I get a 50 yeah so the magic or plummets uh you can roll me v d6 falling damage oh my gosh five four five six - how much is that total 14 22 22 22 28 damage the magic so you throw the javelin it lands in its wing and it just cries out as it tail spins down and lands back on the castle tower with a loud crash and lets up this pain moan I also oh and he takes an extra from the trip seven damage that leaves him bloodied and then I'm gonna go get my I'm gonna go get my javelin okay so I want to hop off the hop off yeah and I want a client I want to like slide down the okay give me an acrobatics check may I use athletics your I got a twenty if it was acrobatics alright sure sure yeah so you slide down like megaman slides stuff yeah yeah slide down the side leap off and retrieve your javelin and then i gotta stab them again with it nice go for it stabby stabby i get a oh wait i coulda advantage because he's prone yep almost like a 26 to hit that hits for another ten damage and then you know what I'm gonna do distracting strike on him for another five damage they'll finish him that attacks them gets a advantage thank you and I guess yeah I think I'm good that's return that's it that's all you want to do I guess I'm dead oh my god javelin back nice that's an awesome turn so like basically you just cut this guy down knock him off a castle roof his neck breaks you pull out your javelin throw it that's how you Pluto Jackson it has to sometimes Pluto Jackson your way everything somebody comes late late it you did creme brulee it already top around Vail you are a pincushion [Laughter] I see the manticore go down and hear Pluto reach out to me and I say you know what i'ma go for it so I take my bow I study myself and he said I have advantage you do have advantage but the manticore is prone behind the battlements from your current position yeah so it might just knock it might just give you regular yeah if you ignore 1/2 and 3/4 cover ok it's it's still prone so that that does cancel it out though all right I'll give it a go ok 16 that's a hit and are you based with it or no yep but did I say the manticore cuz that it knows made of core 22 damaged the air knocked to the ground as it just starts to try to get up and it's rearing back to swipe at pollute Oh an arrow just goes right through its temple yes and it drops at the ground turn to Pluto I say does that count as like a half for each of us no you are the Slayer of the manticore that's my resume [Laughter] congratulations I get my second shot and I'm gonna take it right at this Knoll that's right across from me okay sixteen that's a hit 22 the null is hid in the jugular and with a spout of blood collapses in a heap over the battlements and I take yes you know what I'm just gonna start to go back and I want to start to climb up the wall so I probably can get like halfway climb all up there and you also see that right behind Pulido is a doorway leading into the same town oh you know what I'm I'm gonna do that I'm gonna go in there in the door yeah take it open okay bust through and just get inside you open the doorway into a rather fetid storeroom that the Noles appear to have been using as a den of some kind and there's a ladder leading up to the trapdoor extensively the top and then another hatch in the floor as well with a ladder leading down um I want to go inside the door and like be at the bottom of the ladder to go up okay cool the manticore is slain so the next one is Sebastian how far away's this other tower the other tower is only like 40 feet away it's really close okay I I'm standing on top of this tower now alone Pluto just murdered a guy and like disappeared and I saw a Manticore die and I'm just like okay cool what can I do I look down on this tower and all there's all these like Dazed and Confused Knolls and I'm like they got that I look over at the other Tower and I look down at my necklace and I'm like I don't really know what this does if I pluck one of the gems from my necklace and just go yeah and toss it and it's going to yeah a blossom of flame engulfs the tower and the battlements erupting I think it catches like the majority of the whole I think there's like this guy that's not in there because they all rush towards the front yeah they did yep you and it blossoms around in a curtain to flame so it actually completely engulfs the whole area and in flames yes because that wonderful phrase the fireball spreads around corners I forgot how nice it is to roll so many dice this is why people like fireball gross see I see four sixes from here or you know what I'm gonna use my meta magic to Rose so I'll tell you a necklace of fireballs isn't casting fireball yeah okay yeah I took it you or sixes help me map yes 24 okay to play 423 4 plus 32 plus 5 37 cool so all the nulls there have to make a saving throw or die yeah the first six of them all fail it's DCE oh it's the the necklace might be different right yeah it is okay let me just hop on it DC 15 okay so the first six die they're annihilated start from the ones closest to you yeah to it doing this one - wow so eight die that are under the template are there any left up there there's the one guy on top he makes a saving throw and he's bloodied by it he ducks down so I imagine that the fireball basically hits the side of the tower and it spreads around and just this curtain of flame just turns the Noles to ashes it spreads around the tower but it doesn't actually like just the fanning of the flame goes up around the top of the tower top till he gets cooked a bit his tail gets singe off but he ducks down when I threw it I also duck down and then I pop back up and I'm glad did you guys see that it also annihilates both the ballistas and the two cauldrons are burning with fire and whatever fluid and the barrels that are up there break open and apart and this vile fluid just spreads across the entire roof of it oh yeah I like a sunburn on like the right side of my face from and you can hear that as the explosion goes off and the Noles are annihilated up there that there's a from the soldiers and Sebastian looks out at them and goes my name's Sebastian cool anything else Sebastian no I'm pretty happy with those all again the remaining Knowles okay so the Knowles on the other side I am inside the doors here yeah I'm just kind of falling over there so basically all the ones that weren't affected by Russia pollute Oh with their with their keening blades taking out their their knives these rusted awful-looking salvaged weapons these three Knowles that are still on the battlements dogpile you pollute Oh with a flurry of teeth and blades Wow as they come through stabbing downward only one blade manages to penetrate getting a 22 versus your AC for eight points of slashing damage how cool got me under the under the arm that's I was defending myself and Pluto it is your turn and I start stabbing back III go camera I kept my decent it's important I go I don't have anything to say so I just start stabbing them I don't have any anything I miss I miss so 10 sorry 11 pardon 11 but not it's still a mystery and then 17 that's a hit for I'm just gonna pick one at random for a 12 damage that leaves it bloody but still alive and then I'm going to knock one of the other healthy ones I'm gonna try to knock it prone a 19 it is knock prone and I'm gonna stay there I'm going to stay to their cool well you're up um so I climb up and peek my head out the kind of ladder climb up the ladder pick up Sebastian the fireball no but did you see me get hit with lots of things yeah it hurts and I I'm still sticking out of you yeah I kind of swish around and I see the guy that was singed I'm like oh yeah and I take my shot at him or Chris oh that guy is alive when t7 damaged the arrow just shoots right through his spine and it's he just kind of stands there for a moment with shock because it hasn't gone her it's hard on her his spine just collapsed oh all right and then I see Pluto I kind of look over the edge to see Pluto and I see him getting pummeled and I go after the one that Pluto hit it looks a little bit worse for wear oh yeah 23 got it 26 mm a little ear and fire straight down and it hits the null rate in the top of its head and I duck behind the duck behind the the area just down a little bit still keeping an eye out between but just for any incoming attacks nice oh it's me now yep uh-huh I come up next to veo and look down and there's the other one that's still based with Pluto yeah and I'm going to throw a fire bolt Adam okay getting a 27 that is nice and that's gonna be doing what are we got tootie 1013 damage leaves it bloodied go singed like it's comrades I got him he's he's hurt finish him Thanks I ducked down as well but beside Bayer I'm like oh this is nice I like I like this little hidey spot I don't we have to find the thing the Knowles to Knowles stand up and oppress their attack against Bluto hello one gets an 18 and a 23 23 is good and the other I gets nothing higher than Tiffany so those two hits that get through deal a total 12 points of damage didn't only one go through oh no the 18 misses then doesn't yes okay so I'll just roll that it is just six points of damage pull it up you basically just healed me you're welcome as the Knowles push push their attack forward from the opposite Tower come another six Knowles so you guys have some casualties over there yeah give you one big guy I have a I have a running tally of how many Knowles I have left but I don't have enough miniatures to represent the number of Knowles that are actually here oh my gosh also I think Sebastian your winner yeah you can sebastian i want to just say that i don't think we're ever gonna catch up to your number nose rush out onto the rooftop and several of them see the devastation in front of them and they see the chemical fluid in front of them and many of and as they do so the nulls stop very very suddenly and see all these fluids spilled across across the top and they begin howling and barking at it and well many of them rush out they see this and they the Noles that were gonna come out onto this part of the rooftop and said head back inside and some of them begin climbing up the top of that other tower that hasn't had the chemical spill across it how many of them go up three of them go up two of them just go back into the tower and one of them stays out and ends up taking a potshot at Sebastian Oh which it fires it shots but they both bounce off the battlements good with that we go to Pluto so just taking a quick survey we've got some of the hypnotic pattern I'm based with two nulls but do I see any immediately or in my vision can I see a crank or do I know that it's inside or it must be in since gotta be inside right yeah okay I'm gonna keep stabbing so my spirit oh gosh but it's embarrassing I'm like I'm gonna tell you what I rolled and then a 20-6 that hits the wounded one yes so then a 410 damage it is slain so I stabbed it and then I'm gonna mm-hmm I'm gonna push the other one away getting a 28 it can't muscle up to that so I'm gonna push it back okay out of the way of the door can I get it out of the way that you go that far so that yeah you can't get it out of the way I just want to push it back enough so I can run inside yep and I'm gonna use my movement to go inside and start looking frantically or so this is a pretty nondescript tap like this this tower here there's a hatch going down into the main fortress and a ladder going up to where Vale and Sebastian are but there's nothing on the top level of this portrait of the the battlements here or the top castle that has any sort of gate can I open the hatch the hatch is open and a ladder leads down I'm gonna start climbing down okay down up down I'm gonna start climbing down and using the rest of my movement cool you climbed down one level to another the ladder ends and there is a doorway that is closed and another hatch with another ladder leading down another level okay I'm gonna we got more hatches and levels endorsed that's buildings work oh man Drakken I'm so weird in caspia we only have bungalows that's why it's so weird to be here we've only ever had we don't believe I'm canon now is a Howcast well most of Castillo will just have bungalows there are definitely castles in Castilla I was poor no I'm kidding I'm super rich I lived in a one-level castle yeah just a big giant one level okay yeah you might live down on the state then wasn't maybe I was just scared of stairs maybe yeah I had a stair phobia okay so with that will you go through the door or down the next hatch door okay do the rest of you follow we're like how I know we're half in combat one of them is kind of alive and then there's a couple like the other ones I just know once in trading on those ones on the ground like I I can't even talk to you you're inside you're like two floors down yeah I'm up here and I know that if we don't take care of these guys they're also gonna cause ruckus for the people coming in so I say we've cleared this floor okay unless you want to keep going keep going and finding the hatch or that thing no you yell it yeah hey behind the leader or come back well Pluto you do have enough going that you could open the door I do it okay you kick open the door oh and in front of you is a no not a million but there are several do I have to kick open the door and I open it yeah you you you open the door and in front of you is a large guard room that has several more Knoll bunks mostly just roughly it's a skinned animal fur thatch and straw all piled around several what looks like a makeshift indoor cooking fire that the Noles have been keeping inside something yeah and a pile of human corpses that they've been eating and spit roasting and there are four Knowles in this room with their weapons drawn but behind them is a large gate winch in several years I found the lover and I closed the door okay and how much more movement what I roughly okay I closed the door and I brace myself against the talk already and we will race ourselves because we're gonna take our break before we delve back into the ruins I'd like to give a

your first order with that let us return to the battle where as this emboldened by the sound of the thunderous explosion that wiped out the null forces on the South Tower the silver order has pressed forward and you can hear over the din of battle the emboldened forces of the silver order and the hooded lanterns making their way closer and closer to the walls as members of the silver order begin to reach the walls but not the gate so you can see see from the the tower further to the the south a group of the silver order warriors manages to get some of the siege ladders up onto the city walls and begin assaulting the nul the Noles firsthand meanwhile the hooded lanterns continue to make battle from the north with several of them pushing closer to the city walls and the other side of the gate you can hear the the sound of the horns blares out of the and as I said basically all is well is the sound of two continuous horn blasts so everyone is to each other over the battle press forward we're going forward it's going good so the the paladin's are actually getting on to the wall now yes they are oh there we have backup sweet yeah they're not at the gate a group of the paladins - this to the south have managed to fight their way onto the wall they've landed one of the siege ladders has made contact but they are still fighting against the Noles that are that are up there meanwhile their sea dragon is still moving forward it's still but because you guys have taken out the ballistas on the rooftops they're able to make and you did it really fast they're they're able to make their way closer to the to this the walls themselves at the same time you can see that there are a lot of nulls on the walls and many of them are also star like still holding back in pockets and more ore coming towards the gate itself whose turn is it we left off with Pluto we are at bay oh so I'm still on top of the roof on the top piece yeah they're still Knolls on the south side yes there's there's knowles on the north and south on the north side there is still one wounded knoll that pluto had pushed back that is scrambling to it's to his feet and there are four Knolls that have been hypnotized by hypnotic pattern Pluto is down in the in the North Tower proper on what is the the topmost inner level of of the tower where there are four more Noel's in one of the guard rooms there to the south there are at least seven Noel's still on that tower although only two of them are on the main Battlement level with three on the upper forecastle so there's there's five Noel's on the top on the south tower top right now that you can see um I take a shot because I'm worried that the other null is gonna wake up the ones with him not a pattern so I aim an attack at him cool 15 that hits 20 damage it shoots him down and he drops dead and then I aim across to one of the nulls in one of the opposite towers uh 21 to the hit 20 damage another slain uh and then I can use my cunning action to try to hide behind the Battlement I yes you can okay and I do that okay with that Sebastian so across from me in the South Tower there are now four Knowles on top of the tower there's two nulls on top and two nulls on the Battlement level and then the other ones that are that are there are hiding okay I turn to Vale and I'm like you're not the only one who's good with a shot and I I say stumbling over my words and I jump up and I'm gonna cast scorching ray yeah and I'm going to aim at one of the Noel's at the top tower I'm using your rolling 21 to hit eight damage okay and I'm gonna blast blast again that's 18 also a hit or 9 damaged blasphemous under and I'm going to aim my last shot at one of the other the other Knoll that's up on top there 21 again nice for 11 damage that leaves him bloodied and then I duck back down and I was like huh wasn't too bad cool nice shooting Tex Ludo or actually sorry they it's the Knowles so the Knowles opposite opposite you are not really in a position where they can return fire so two of the Knowles clamour across the rooftop as they as they do so and rush towards the doorway of your of your tower and the other two Knowles they take shots at the soldiers down below and then duck boat behind the battlements as well the Knowles on the main level both one of them barge it kicks the door pushes the door open everyone's kicking the door is open and brings his blades up in to pollute Oh getting a ten and a eight did my do I hold the door at all is you just Burt are you were you holding the door sure I mean what can I do what do you you I basically open the door saw them and I walk okay if you want to I imagine that you closed the door I didn't know that you want to actually hold it in place but we'll say make it a we can make it a post strength track who can I try to hold it yeah uh just strength yeah sixteen I get a sixteen as well so let's roll off whoa door fight I got a ten I got a fifteen oh so he wrestles the door forward and stabs at you once but missing the other one takes out his bow and tries to shoot you at close range ah he fires two shots but you're able to like swing the door back close a little bit to keep and the door just euros yep okay back to the top of ale um so there's just to visualize two guys coming in the door yep of the North Tower and the other two have taken cover behind the battlements can I still see them you cannot not from where you are cuz they're on the top level and they've coward they've got total cover from where they are can I open the trap door and shoot yes the two that have clamored across the rooftop to the come to the North Tower they're on the Battlement level and you can see them from from the forecastle level take some shots at them cool 22 it's a hit Oh 24 damage what happens oh I get him right in the gullet as he's leaping across the roof you pop up fire the shot in the gullet and he just trips slips off the roof and falls off the off the tower and there's another one beside him right uh 14 that is a hit 17 damage he miraculously survives despite being shot in the eye and then I take again my cunning action to hide behind the battlements okay I'm like a gopher I just keep popping out popping up in different places Sebastian seeing the guy gets shot in the eye and continue running I pop up and I'm just going to throw a fire bolt out I'm cool and I'm like I've got him don't worry yeah I got him twenty twelve twenty six nice rollout damage twenty lots twenty watts basically anything but snakes twelve damage she's burnt away Wow double-digit Sebastian whoo all righty any nail Sebastian with him dead and the other two I can't even see them right so I open up the hatch and I start climbing down towards Pluto how can I make it like him yeah you can climb down one level so you're one level above yeah gluto you're up I'm going to stab cool so as I I'm trying to keep the door sort of together oh my god embarrassing skull-splitter chritmas oh my gosh I can't do both I'm trying to keep the door and I'm just trying to stay like wild Spears into the doorway okay the other null does the same stabbing across the opening in the doorway yeah getting 17 and a 15 to hit yeah we're both like dancing and the other thing and one tries to fire some arrows through in the opening and gets a 23 and an 18 the 23 hits he catches me for 7 points of piercing damage as one arrow manages to find its way in and hit you in the shoulder and I let out a gig the other Knolls in the other four castle tower pop up take some shots and duck back down oh we gotta stop actually help me no I'm coming to Howard job um the Knowles that are hypnotic pattern I'm gonna take some shots of them okay fish in a barrel easy sushi 15 is a hit um 21 and that is one dead incapacitated null it is permanently incapacitated now you're just like walking up over them and just be like and dead oh no I'm still on the roof just being like just executing them yeah essentially do they see or they don't even see you right they can see they're just hypnotized mm-hmm I was supposed evil laugh I have ever rule T's we visit upon G no I miss does she get advantage if there no is it I mean given that she's above them and they're they're incapacitated I will grant you advantage against them yeah one help that 12 you try to do a cool trick shotting your mind you're like oh wait what am i doing not the actual barrel of the fish no and then I again I use my connection to hide okay Sebastian I cool slide that's what it's called when you slide down a ladder you cool slide down the ladder okay you cool slide down the ladder and I I land on my feet and I'd be right behind Pluto I'm right behind you ah like swing and there's like swing Knowles and I'm like and I'm screaming and I just start screaming I'm going to just grab bluto's shoulder and throw my hand over top and blast some webs into the doorway at these two guys okay cool and that ends the end your hypnotic pattern up above yes it does good luck they are you've got this and yeah I'm just gonna hang out behind Cluedo I'm okay so the webs go in there super the Knowles so two of the Knowles are in the webs they both get 15 on their savings 16 needed Thank You splitter okay so they're restrained the other two dolls don't know what to make of this situation I mean they can run into the webs they don't but upstairs the UH three unhypnotized Knowles snap out of it and seeing what's going on one the Knowles rush into the tower one of the Knowles climbs up the ladder and opens the hatch and that's all it's movement in action one of the other the other two Knowles come in to the other sides of the top hatch look down take their bows and both shoot at Sebastian from above Sebastian with advantage getting in twenty three two hits and a so two shots I get a twenty three and a fourteen I'm going to shield to block the fourteen but the 23 made it through my shield damage piercing damage and two shots against pollute oh one getting a twenty two hit and the other getting a critical hit Oh so they both hit I just don't take a crit Pluto you take five damage from the regular shot and 14 damage from the crit as the two Knowles knocked back their bows fire down the hatch and hit hit and pepper you both with arrows from a bow I I don't take crits though oh you don't take the crits you don't special armor it's only eight damage 8 & 8 & 5 8 and 5 p.m. I'm gonna make my concentration your crits are no good here 21 on my concentration is good Webb remains in effect oh no why did I stop concentrating on that spell I thought Vale was taking care of it okay continuing along we go to top of the round with I didn't skip people did I know yes and gone you just went with the Knowles you just shot us yeah so Knowles and Pluto no no cuz I went right I think we just did the Knowles last by accident oh I see okay so then we're at the top of the technical okay yeah yeah you have another chance I get a turn every round yeah okay all right there in the web yeah so much I'm a hukka spear take the ladder how high isn't the ladder out the guys shooting up yeah yeah how high is it 20 feet okay yeah 27 to hit for 12 damage that leaves him bloodied well but now I gotta go get my spear the spear launched up catches him in the Johnny recoils back and I got a clunk can i how fast can I climb a ladder you can go up to half your speed up the up the ladder but if you're if you go 15 feet up the ladder you'll be in reach to stab another one okay I do that well can i sword they go give me back my spear it's in you and I'm gonna I have to I'm gonna use precision strike on that let's remember 617 to hit it's a hit for 13 damage so as he recoils back from the spear you cut his leg off at the ankle and he falls down and falls down the hatch and dies beautiful nice and then uh yeah I'm still not quite in range I'm still holding my sword the spear went down yep yeah and because you're on the ladder you're gonna with your sword you're gonna have to not have your shield okay yeah so I'm just like holding on yeah my shield they're cool that's right on my turn okay top of the round with Mayo so what's up oh good we're good we didn't lose the stream oh that's fun okay let us know what their there was any clubs will edit this open post get in post so I see this guy pop his head up correct up to the top level yeah all right I cast a zephyr strike 12 the air so as he pops his head up the arrow goes right through his as he pops his head up the arrow goes right through his ear ouch sales rate through but but and lands right beside me you just see this look of a surprise on his face his ears were already Pierce yeah that's right my second shot for 16 that's a hit better without advantage moment he goes I made it I'm alive I'm gonna live forever 23 we can we we all know what just occurred this look of shock on his face and that will be the face he is buried well burned in probably right between the eyes and I didn't even have to get up I feel like I'm just kind of like still crouched down I'm like cool any angle um no I'm gonna stay here I'm still gonna gonna get it yeah yeah yeah get all these guys I because I think there's still what how many more there's one at the that shot the one that shot Sebastian is still there okay and then there's the four inside and then there's the two yep on the other side yeah okay Sebastian I'm gonna fire both the one that shot me okay I quit nice yeah so I'm screwed Oh is there like fighting them I'm like lining it up I'm like I think I can do this and I like get him right in the face with some fire 21 damage it just blows away the upper top of his body and just there's these legs that just it falls on me Pluto did you see that it like yeah it falls on you on it's in me there's just the shatter of Ash flame burning body parts and burning Knoll and blood it just splatters your helmet I can't protect myself with my shield I'm holding kind of the ladder mouth I'm tasting it and tasting in the nor does it taste like victory he's like like people like they were eating people he was just eating people there was parts of him of the thing you just aid that fell out of his it's at least properly it round of it's good none of it's good and all of it the Knowles - of the Knowles try to escape from the webs and fail miserably the other two Knowles circle around the back of the webs and they try to fire two shots across the webs at Sebastian's build that's gonna be a tough shot it is they are doing so with disadvantage and their arrows basically get stopped in the wet haha I like that it looks like it's a sticky situation you're in you know keep going holes your webs nailed it [Laughter] I'm all out of one-liners guess you got a little bit preoccupied on the web listen here Knowles I came here to kick ass and deliver one-liners and I'm all out of one-liners he's back the king is back nice okay Ludo you're up spinning who I assume is a hooded Lantern out of my mouth we I don't know the plan I'm gonna cool slide down the ladder because now I know how do because I've seen it I've seen it I've watched it I've learned this I learned this did I do it a little less elegantly and I and I'm gonna start we got to get in this room and I'm gonna pave the way I'm like a I'm like that ship that goes in front of other ships but I'm gonna tugboat my way to victory choo choo is that would tug boats to 26 at 26 against the know--let's in the West yeah oh wait I get an advantage he's lucky 14 damaged cool leaves them bloody and then I'm just swinging my I've been swinging in at 21 to hit for another 14 damage role to see if the crit so nothing stuck in the web's and he's basically in a perfect position for you to bisect him nice it just takes two chops and so the end of the web kind of pulls them apart a little bit yeah relieves the tension yeah yeah make my way towards the edge of the actually no I'm not gonna go into the room because then I'm gonna get shot with arrows yeah I'm gonna wait outside the room okay don't worry second door closed I'm gonna close the door and then I'm gonna second wind nice and that's me me turn okay top of the round Dale I think we have to move quickly so we still have one more on the top and then - II know all the the battlements Europe at the top yep and there are more Knowles making their way onto the battlements to the the Knowles that came up in the sign level nor no more Knowles have shown up on the South Battlement okay and also there's just the two that are on the top up up there that are firing some shots down there's still arrows coming out of the arrow slits that are in the tower but the but the getting a shot in there will be pretty difficult because with the arrow slits it's easy for the Noles to just step back and not even be yeah yeah you could try so ready a shot for when someone shoots out of it but they're still firing out of the the arrow slits in the front on both levels and actually but all the Knowles now that are on the north Battlement on the top on the top they're all dead okay yeah and I keep like so the so there was two on the south but I still can't see them they are popping up to take shots but they are then ducking back down can I ready an action so that way when I do see them pop up I'm ready to see them absolutely you'll be able to ready one attack cool yep I did that so my turn yep I pushed the door open and play like sidestep because you put the wet the the webs in the in the doorway okay you can make an acrobatic trick to try to avoid your own webs you know what I'll just I'm just gonna light up the webs from here I'm gonna use another scorching right okay I like what you're doing yeah yeah I'm gonna use another scorching ray and I'm gonna shoot at the guy in the web's an advantage on that and because of my elven accuracy now that helpful little I guess seventeen it hits yay nice job eight damage cool and the webs are set on fire fire web we know how to put out fires no webs ignite we're gonna shoot him again with 3ds I think are you quick using quicken spell oh you're squirts going red yeah yeah sorry I'm sorry I thought you were fire bolt fire bolt scorching ray both like so much fire 25 also hit I'm gonna use a meta magic on that poor poor roll and I'm gonna re-roll it there we go 10 damage you sleep ray I'm just gonna remove the webs and put the fire there okay and my last scorching ray can I shoot at one of these guys yep awesome I hit four seven damage cool nice and then I step back the Knowles the Knowles that are in the room are barking and yapping and freaking out and they continue to to fire some arrows but you or did you close the door again yes yeah so they just freak out and barking yell and there's a big fire in front of ya alright is the web still burning yeah how long does the web burn for it'll burn for at least another round cool Igor burns out yep can you turn it off Pluto you can you turn off the webs yes turn off the webs Sebastian concentrating on the webs just the fire like there's there's a couple mattresses down there that straw mattresses that would keep it going but it's not enough to be an obstacle because I'm running in okay and I'm just charging at the closest no all for 18 for 10 damage 18 to hit yep 4/10 and then I'm gonna stab him again the first hit actually kills him because he was damaged by Sebastian they gonna try to take a swing at the second one but I only get a 13 that is a miss miss and that but I'm gonna try to knock him backwards so you rush into this just this is disgusting dilapidated guard room and as you do so you cut down one of the Noel's in front of you and you can see that the door there's two other doorways I'm sense leading it around on the other side to where the arrow slits are and one of the doorways is open and you can see that a knoll has taken is his position there and turned around and as you come into the room he fires a shot at you oh my bad and he hits you in the back but it doesn't penetrate your armor oh yeah Annie Kelly you can put those four holes in the front there for me and I'm gonna knock the one that I missed on the ground with a 27 I want to I want to try to not confirm you do and I'll stand over him Wow 20 but you got a 27 it's my athletics it's a display of strength like this moment to the ground nice already uh to the top with Vail now did any of them pop up oh yeah one of them would have popped up yeah nine and he pops up the end ducks down rate as the arrow comes in alright um on this so deal I've got those two kind of popping up and I'm like you know what I need a little bit of healing so I'm going to swing a greater healing potion excuse me 21st yep uh and then I open the hatch and I I cool cool slide down down both ladders but that's like twice as cool I'm not as hurt anymore I'm feeling a little bit better but news there's still the Noles that need butt-kicking on the other tower yeah there's a lot of nose yeah we'll kill them help there's Knowles in here oh god there's Knowles in there um and I feel I know Jill 'ti because I haven't been taking movement on my other turn so I can then take it again again um so I pop back into the room oh there's fire what have you two been up to in here normal stuff there's you know what I realized that I act reacted by taking my healing potion so I'm like you know what Pluto I'll be back [Music] [Laughter] I'll be back Sebastian you're up I'm gonna burst through the door and poke my head around to the one that just shot Pluto in the butt and I'm going to fire bolt him okay ye twelve as the fire bolt sales in the know like dodges behind the doorway that's our move and I jump back okay guys all right I know what's happening here we are like this is what we do that's what I did when I first came in desert was like nope nope room and now I'm stuck in it with like six Knowles the null pushes the door open that you close Sebastian yeah and who's right there in front of him by the door he slashes the Bayeux twice getting a 18 to hit yeah as is serrated rusted blade carves into you for six points of damage absolutely you just get surrounded by a bunch of Knowles hi two of them come around and they shoot you with their bows they draw their bow strings back and they're vile arrows sail towards you know Jesus one gets a 22 hit Europe one gets a 20 and a 23 so three arrow shots all hit for a total of one T two damage yowza and the other two carve into you with their blades getting an 18 to hit and a 12 mrs. 19 and 13 misses oh gosh so the arrows so as I'm fending off them yeah a tight the arrows are just pelting me your AC's 20 correct yeah yeah so he had they just are you're fending off the attacks and just the two ones that fire the arrows managed to get into the openings and arrows just wow wow wow but you're still standing I'm remarkably I also um concentrating on Zephyr strike right now you need a 10 or higher nope okay no one strike is done so oh my Zephyr strike we go to pollute Oh this is exactly where I wanted to be I've got the Marais or how I'm gonna do what I do best and just start swinging oh god no 11 no they deflect the blows and a 21 that is a hint for eight damage the blade carves into one this is one of the ones that got fire bolted earlier and it carves into him knocks from the ground and dies and then I'm going to shove the one the other one then I'm yep twenty three I get a six and then I so I'm gonna shove him back five feet okay and then oh no no what quick survey of my surroundings there's a bit of fire it's a bit of fire there's four Knowles there's the gears that control the gates and they oh and Sebastian in the stairwell the ones holding the crossbows both the bows yeah I'm gonna run at them okay and just base myself with them okay you rushed towards the hello okay Dale you're up um so I'm about ten feet away from an old ones right up to you cuz it just stabbed okay so he's kinda in there um I take another Zephyr strike and you know you could just cutting action to disengage I want that advantage though I want that advantage I'm hopefully it's gonna okay we got roller six mini yeah um so I take a step back towards the ladder aim right at his face and I aim right at his chunk Oh 18 that is a hit okay twenty-eight damage it's not a nice way to go being shot in the junk especially the killing blow yeah I feel healthy I feel like there might be like something really vital in there like it probably would have to penetrate like your bowels are like click and then you go into septic shock immediately fast effect yeah there's another right in front he just got pushed and like towards the doorway so now he's in perfect view not even facing me so I'm going for the rear no nine yeah it doesn't hit him in the butt alright I aimed it didn't see Sebastian you're up sir mm-hmm I'm just gonna yeah I'm gonna shoot another fire bolt at the the guy yeah pork chops pork chops what about pork chops oh you little twenty it's a hit 11 damaged leaves and bloodied little Jackson you were in the room with several more Knowles no they dropped their bows pull out their daggers and lunge towards you and the highest I get to hit is Wow with four attacks as they throw their bows to the ground to stab into you I get one hit for a twenty versus your AC nice that'll be seven slashing damage is one of the the rusted knives carbs carbs across your back and the other Knoll takes his knives and rushes towards Sebastian the one that I just fire bolted yeah he turns around rushes you with his blade you didn't like that getting a natural one and an eighteen to hit no okay that hits for eight points of slashing damage oh oh I've been stabbed you guys I've been stabbed oh I'm sitting there with like Manticore is this my boy you maybe bleed my own blood you start going white I try to let the him yelling fall on deaf ears as I'm dealing with 25 dead were 411 damaged the one that hit me I mean I that's thought and then on the same one I'll do 19 to hit yep or 12 damage with two Swift strokes you cut the flow down and then and then I'm going to knock the another one prone Kabam Oh only at 12 I let out a Caspian roar okay I stand over my nemesis top of the round with nail no you're on the opposite side of him because Sebastian was blocking the way I take my two shots on him saving Sebastian hopefully nope I miss in this tiny space as you scramble back trying to shoot a point-blank range and a criticalness I'm doing no saving today just shoot me okay the while there a bastion it's over to you I'm gonna just try to fire bolt him now he's right up to me yes you got disadvantage I'm in a panic I'm trying to firebolt that was actually pretty good yeah 21 that hits 12 damage that leaves a bloody didn't see nice in a panic you burst fire into his chest and he cries out as he is burned me and him are making the same sounds yeah but he redoubled his attacks get it getting a 6 to hit and the 21 to hit you Sebastian I dodged out of the way of the 6 right into the 21 he stabs you in the side for 5 points of damage the other NOLA rises to its feet and assaults Pluto hello getting 2 hits in 21 and a 20 ow for a total of 9 points of damage as he takes the daggers and just drives them both together they don't penetrate deeply but they're they're bad guys it hurts your absolute oh you see the last one in my room yeah yeah I'm just I I stay I pull them closer with the daggers and then I miss and then I as I'm trying to do something cool and then I do 26 for 8 damage cool they're both bloodied and then oh man died and then I knock him away no I knock him down again for 717 you got it uh-oh stay down down boy sit Leitao you're up play dead I yelled Sebastian I'm like stop making him move and I take my 14 that's a hit oh and I got my sneak attack is your base with him right yes I am 27 again he turns to slash at Sebastian giving veo the critical opening that she needs to hit him under the ribs and he fall over dead twice almost yes your you've managed to slither out of the way ah good and I rushed into the room I saved you you say as you run by and I see the other guy on the ground and even though it's with disadvantage I still take my second shot whoo nope listen again say I'm here to save you - thanks baby Sebastian the thought that counts um I burst into the room wiping the little bit of blood off and I push Vale out of the way and I go I'm here to save you Pluto Jackson and I shoot a fire bolt with disadvantage I'm skin you look like no.16 that hits oh oh wait yeah yeah seven damage and the Knoll is immolated yay no first Sam there's like 12 dead Noel's guys guys get that gate open as he explodes into fire yeah I rush over to the thing and just start cranking alright you begin cranking and there's a screeching of metal as you hear the sound of the portcullis raising as the chains pull it upwards Irish over as well - and you all help okay actually you know what I'm gonna stay at the door and I'm gonna keep the door shut I'm gonna like push my small amount of body weight up against it I want you guys to feed me health potions from my bag well I'm cranking this he's cranking and I'm like I like got him and I like have it like in a squeeze bottle like actually you know what how much is the in 1818 okay I'm gonna take one of those actually I'm rug don't wave it on me as I'm again do do you open the new juror finish off the trip I finished off the old boy good girl yes thank you thank you because nothing would meet you I'm not very fresh as it is so you know she appreciates the empty jar mentality I always use it because I'm excited for my new salsa what is salsa we're gonna find this salsa I'll make some for you recipe did you learn this in another city yes Wow Illyria makes a really good salsa yeah so much game Oh oh yeah I want you to feed me to to potions I'm rubbing it on myself and I'm like I feel so much more healthy now ah and I pull out did you guys see I like look there's a cut on my arm a little help yeah it's a crank and the two of you working together it takes it takes a couple rounds for the the gate to rise up but you're able to open it open it up now we have to get to the other one yeah you hear the sound of the horns blaring as the charge of the the charge of the silver order begins as they rush towards the now open front gates beyo I'm gonna give you the horn can you give a double blast right now from the top of the hour okay yeah and I should I go out now is that a good do we want to maybe you like bolt this room shut or something can we is there a way we can make sure it I have an idea yes um I couldn't like mold earth no it's it's works oh never mind no it's a rubble around dirt there's buildings and and whatnot you still have you still need to get to the other gate mechanism yeah and the from what you can surmise at the layout here you either need to go in through the other top or down and below to get to it and if there are any other defenders down there or anyone in in between the gates it seems like they've held their positions rather than come to attack you I'm just worried about this cat is there any way we can block it and break the lock or something like that come inside yeah I'm thinking the same thing or or I want just taking a quick look and I disabled this to make it so it stays open give me an investigation check five there's a lot of gears and a lot of mechanical parts looking it over probably you could do something but from what you look at you can't tell what you would smash to make it stay in place and what you would smash to instantly make it crash to the ground that's what I was already put in the gears though to like at least jam them in the position that they're at there you can make a perception check 20 20 you're proficient with these tools Sam you see that there is a spot in the gears where you could disable the mechanisms where it would probably with with the work that you put in it would mean it would take somebody about an hour to fix it oh yeah working with a successful check but if you do it wrong the gate mechanism could be beyond repair like but it won't repair it won't it will stay open but the gate mechanism itself yeah would be basically broken and you need like me the parts would need to be replaced in order to get it to open and shut again or meant to keep it open I don't really here what happens afterwards no we're meant to make sure that the gate is still functioning that's the attire I heard open yeah you'd be able to lock it open and then it would be able to be closed again yeah if if you do it right it'll work fine but if you fail it will stay open and you would be able to close it again but then parts would need to be replaced in order for it to be able to open and close again it would not be a matter of repairing it with what's on-site the whole reason why we teleport it in rather than just bursting down the gate was because they want to be able to use the gate that's true I'm just wondering then maybe we need to barricade the door and leave it as is cover it with some of these terrible mattresses I think our best bet is if we go down and through that's not we're gonna meet the rest of the nose up top we've taken care of most of them okay yeah so I think I'm on board if we go down and through nobody's gonna be coming through that way and getting through us to turn this thing off remember there's archers on the other side that are on the second power and I'm pretty sure they're preoccupied with but we need to take them out yeah there's also paladin's on the wall working their way towards them they're shooting at paladin's on the ground I feel like they're probably preoccupied is there anything that we can at least put in front of the door in this room not that would not without compromising your ability to get it yeah yeah oh no I mean like can we take that stuff outside close the door and then put it in front of the door yes you you could it would take you about a minute of work to do that or what if we I break the lock what if we just take away the the ladder is the ladder removable that led down here so we just take break there officer then no one can come from above and they can only come from below we make it way jump down but it's they hopefully died it's 20 feet yeah okay look we break the ladder and I say that we head down down yeah okay yeah down it got away if there's more Knowles down there we're not worried about the to worry about the wing 20 cool yeah no well there was also on that second level archers in Ian's I thought we just killed the arch or something yeah you did oh those ones but on the other side - that's where we're going yeah so we're gonna take care of them okay as long as we take care of those we're gonna go down and up yeah yeah and that waiting clear the murder holes as well clear our way through the bottom because we've already cleared the top except for two who are dealing with a whole bunch and that makes sense yeah all right so you'll be heading down to the lower level heading across finding your way across and then back up to the other gate mechanism yeah okay well we'll have to see how that goes next week nice that was very that was a pretty that was a slog that was that was an intense I think you guys killed close to 20 No maybe more yeah more lost count I have the amounts it's at Pluto six Aveo eleven but one of those is a Manticore and Sebastian 13 yeah I'm keeping track of like how many I have left and as a way to go wow I did not know that I would get the most kills that's thank you fine boy and a back massage yeah you burn both nicely done so I guess this is going to be a two-parter we're gonna have to stay tuned for next week to find out how the Battle of temple gate goes you hear the sounds and the horns and the thundering hooves of the paladin's charging forth into into the Gateway and you will see where it goes from here mm-hmm good that was nice I was nuts especially near the end it just felt like they just kept coming yeah they're just so many and I've used a lot yeah I'm gonna be drained after this that's for sure but still I still have all my um almost all my sorcery points so I can start getting back spell slots and stuff dig deep next time yeah yep next a big thank you to our cast as always thank you to Jill Kelley and Joe for playing

I can how are you gonna have two castles fight if you don't have to I'll just stack them on top of each other and build them even higher I was actually saying before they show that I built the full-size temple gate and then I realized after I built it that it blocked the cameras so we couldn't see anything so the the temple gate that you saw tonight was not to scale so it's act it was actually half the height that it should be because if I built it at the full height that it actually is yeah so I really for that I was really pleased with how that sounds great I looked as well there's some more pictures of it on the YouTube community page as well of what it looks like and I might take some photos of the full-size build so people can see like the full scale of it yeah
