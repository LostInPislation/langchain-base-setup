live on Kickstarter with out-of-the-box encounters with that let's return to the ruins [Music] Drakken homers no more struck by a falling star the city bathed in Elders fire Hamed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered fifteen years later the monsters stalked the haunted streets of Dragon hybrid car amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Drakon Heim when last we left our heroes they had finally reclaimed the upper levels of the great Cathedral of Saint Rubio vanquishing the remaining leaders of the Noles including a mutated null priestess known as Greg Ora Grigore and the last remaining Knowles who seemed to be fighting for control over who would be the new leader of the pack having claimed the upper reaches of the grand Cathedral of Saint Petruchio our heroes have found that the treasures that they seek documents the bones of the true vo himself or even the bones of our ganas the ancient dragon which can be used to reignite the great brazier that is at the heart of the grand Cathedral lie in the catacombs beneath the grand Cathedral which have now become a haunted ruin with the spirits of the Fallen worshippers of the sacred fire having stirred now that the light has gone out in the grand Cathedral you stand in the altar chamber beneath the Great Dome of the Dragon Heim Cathedral this is a massive room the ceiling which is hundreds of feet in the air in this vaulted and many sectioned dome of stained glass and pure glass windows and there are all manner in the ceiling of reflectors embedded in the dome itself that even though there's not a lot of light coming in from inside the effect of all the reflectors in the dome underneath causes this brilliant sunlight to illuminate in rays that spread out through the chamber and leave the hall lit even though the outer outside it is an overcast and cloudy day in this Hall is brilliant light several of the windows up there are a little bit muggy and so not a purist light is shining in as well it wants it used to but even as you look at the two great doors that you've opened up they'll lead down to the catacombs the sunlight the rays of sunlight illuminates straight down these pathways as well surrounding you of course the center in the room is a great circular dais some 40 feet in diameter with a sets of stairs leading up to this massive brazier filigreed of bronze gold and silver and in the midst of it is this massive pyre that contains burned remains of charcoal a flame that has gone out for at least 15 years this high altar is the representation of the sacred fire and and the worshippers of the sacred fire even claim that well this flame is lit a protective blessing emanates through the whole region every Church of the sacred fire has a flame like this and all of them there are many other smaller churches and chapels for at TRACON Haim and pretty much all of them have gone dark except for the ones in Everwood village but you can imagine how on a sunny day with the flame a lit in here this chamber would be truly brilliant for everything about its architecture the way that the the chambers had been built have all been designed to reflect and intensify the light in this chamber and then up above the there are engravings that tell the story of the myth of the sacred fire there are several other large sarcophagi as well in the shrines that go out around the main altar several of these have been opened sensibly from the inside and there are skeletal remains of several robed worshipers and paladin's splayed out across the floor here as well kind of makes me feel uncomfortable that they're kind of laying on the ground like that I think they were the alarm system yeah but what if something sets off the alarm system I think something already set off the alarm system that's why we don't want to go I mean we have to go in the basement I don't really want to go in the basement but we have to I have a question would it be sacrilegious to try to disguise ourselves as bone people and and maybe like pretend to be undead like do you speak undead Wow undead have a language do they I speak you seemed pretty fluid Dix I took it as an elective i under common maybe that will sound undead yeah and and yeah yeah vo you talked to sticks all the time I do I speak under common as well but I don't know if that's what he's sure what I'm saying is grunts grab a bunch of bones and we make a service look like like we've done this before this is just this is a this is Jack and forest 101 I'm wondering infiltration as my favorite enemy do I remember if undead use dark vision to see give me a because this pertains to your favorite enemy give me a religion check with advantage religion 14 okay many undead creatures are considered by the sacred fire to be blasphemous in nature but it is not unknown for the holy places of the sacred fire to be guarded by deathless guardians amongst the sacred fire you recall that for the most part most people who worship the sacred fire are cremated but the bodies of the clergy and particularly the bodies of flame keepers and paladin's are considered sacred and so they are mummified and entombed rather than cremated because amongst the sacred fire it is believed that their deathless bodies that their spirits though they join the flame in a time of great need their spirits can rejoin their bodies and animate them these are undead creatures but they are very different from the mindless horrors that are animated by necromancer's so these are gonna be really smart undead people they're not quite the same as when a necromancer takes them up but you know yeah that sucks yeah the one thing you can always rely on with undead is that they're usually pretty stupid but if we have smart undead are they strong ones I don't feel be smart but strong for sure well then we'll just have to be extra careful disguising ourselves as I say we have a really strong person I don't know if my disguise self will turn me into his gilded I guess as for your question do they rely on dark vision or or not it would depend on the specific manifestation but they likely do have some poll of darkish okay maybe um maybe the flame keeper can help us well like maybe there's like I don't know holy water or some like magical club that we can use to bash their heads in I mean the I want a holy club at this time the the Lord Commander has returned to the barracks but the night captain several other hooded lanterns and a philia reed are here they are assembling in the square there there you can see that they're making a rough kind of palisade around the entrance to the cathedral to defend it and so if you do want to go talk to them before going for further you certainly could is this is this a dead end or do you think they're dead ask them if there's any knowledge they have about these specific Undead since they are part of their belief well you guys are doing that I'm going to investigate this orb of delirium that I have and see if I can figure it out you're inserting that with your bare hands aren't you oh this one's safe oh that one oh okay sorry this is the one that River gave you yes yep I think you meant the one that we picked out of the eye sockets I was like please don't tell with power I'm basically saying that I'm gonna regain a spouse lot while you guys are doing that oh thank you things that allowed ya a philia reed is in the is in the Isles of the cathedral where they are gathering the remains of the Fallen and she is sprinkling some ash and dust on what remains of them and she she turns to you as you approach and says are you ready are you getting started yeah but Pluto had a question about yeah absolute ollie um I was wondering if you had any sort of undead kind of like murder weapons for example and I never look around is there like a big cross that I could use as like a or something like that okay like a club like a big like one-off there's every bits bits of furniture then two-by-fours and stuff from the tables that the Noles brought in that you could break off so I'm gonna break that off and I'm like can you bless this and so I can use it to smite our enemies that used to be friends a philia read speaks up and she says she smiles strangely she says now if there are spirits of our followers down there as I said they're gonna be mad I we don't what would have become of them if they have stirred from the rest in places their deathless they are beyond death and that is the fate that awaits all of us in the harbor of the sacred fire but and so you can't think of them if the Paladins and the other priests have stirred they're not going to be like regular on dead and the blessings that we would use to fight against creatures of darkness do not work against them cool cool cool and the power of the flame is such that if they are if there is anything left to their cup oriole bodies they may rise again even if you destroy it even if you batter them down but she turns saying a prayer to them their remains and sprinkling some holy water or silver dust over their remains can calm them and prevent them from getting back up again it's a good thing that I assume Pluto knows some holy texts or scripture it may be now for that reason most of our catacombs do have a font of holy water so if you can find that you may be able to take some samples of it you'll also find silver dots down there almost certainly typically we keep a few other things now just beware there are many of us also collect some of what we call waters of the flame these are holy waters but you'll know them because they smell very pungent don't use these they're very flammable so be careful with those Bastien turns around from across the river do these undead burns and exhausted to you like your panting yeah I just absorbed some energy out of this orb it was weird I feel good it would be best if you don't if you do as little as possible to destroy their bodies they are sacred things oh and they will need those bodies in the times of darkness I will be careful that's right we're gonna just push them around or just push them and then keep running you know I don't push I blow things up I know she's right here just I'm whispering okay so if I use the holy water on my weapons will that be more effective with calming them you're some calming and fortunately no no oh I have to actually spray them with it okay if I sprinkle some holy water on a fireball okay as I said it will not harm them but if you manage to subdue them or if you do because their bodies will be sustained by their connection to the flame if you cut them down they will get back up probably in only a few minutes we're gonna go quick but if you do calm them using some holy water and some prayers they may not it may hold them back for a little bit longer and give you the time that you need to get to the true vo Oregon us once you bring those bones back to me we can start now of course you could if you wanted to bring us the remains of other paladin's and priests down there and I could use those as well as part of the ritual of the sacred fire but I'm going to need something very important like the Trujillo's bones or a gong to properly consecrate this way do you think that mature Bo Oregon us would also come back with the others the true vo and our gamma were great martyrs were the cause of the flame and I would hope that they would hold on to a stronger shred of their mind for many joining the flame is the end of their memory of their mortal life their purpose because our spirits when we join the flame are filled with the new purpose that we will have in the battles to come but for great people like our Ghana and the true vo it may very well be that they have held on to more of their minds which may mean that any of the madness that afflicts the other spirits has not gripped them so we can only hope hopefully they're polite when we asked them for some new bones bones so if we come up here with one of those two like any bone will do bone or bones how many do we need like their whole modelling structure is that like steel a rib from what I understand only the thigh bone of a trivia remains oh wow so if he's up and walking around it's gonna be a thigh bone just like okay I can handle it possibly also his jar some of his finger bones but there's not much to him left so gather any of his bones and will it help out if we can gather some other Paladin bones as well like does that make it easier or just the jury'll the true vo or agama would be the most important okay cool cool yeah we're fine we got this I'm not worried they call us the bone collectors I'm Ken Kenji I kind of like can you cause can cause that certainly I go loud if that's your wish all right do go forth bone collectors yes bone collectors like grave I don't envy them to ask ahead of you know it could wear on your spirit I hope that the truth of the light guide your way it's okay I apparently don't have a soul anymore so anyway I'm sure we'll be fine you're mostly shadow sweat it your morning matter light why would you think that you don't have a soul oh because a demon told them through the grapevine I've heard that my soul is has has somebody's name on it other than my own like a Jesus tricking us a bunch of times told him that he doesn't have a soul yeah do you see that pile of meat over there there we no no no promise no bargain no deal or pact can hold a faithful soul away from the flame just remember that faithful soul thank you your one chance at redemption and you mock it we know about only there's another one survived this far without the sacred flame guiding me and it seems like they need my help more than I need their so I didn't say that out loud wasn't to her face guys that's like we're walking away and I'm mumbling that too let's say that to her face let's yeah yeah as you turn those she says this Sebastian I turned back a flame in the darkness those are the most important fires of all don't have to tell me twice that's basically my ammo we're gonna ignite our own sacred fire hey night sacred flames every day you're gonna ignite a sacred flame down there Pluto kind of flavor you don't hold a match near I mean you were you were a t-rex yeah I'm still I'm still recovering from that half Noel that like slowly is like it's like I'm not used to eating that much no if at all if you're gonna be like that you get to be in the back guys I don't know they they basically said don't go destroying Undead well I don't think we're gonna destroy any it sounds like we're gonna hit them they're gonna go down and wake up again we got to just keep moving I don't Lee seen me in combat I don't I don't do like keeping their bodies and times do your best do you think they're gonna go down and explore this while we're here no so like if there's some exploded skeletons we can just be like we were there when we got here yeah I was probably the median when we were here um deal the last thing that a philia reid will say before you go back down are any of you wounded yes slightly I touched I put a bandaid on my chest really not I got my short rest right we got a short leash our ass I'm I I'm a little hurt she she does say you turn well I cannot use a paper cut eyes you're wearing appliances I can bless your bodies yeah she's often free healing I'm gonna good and so she offers to protect the three of you by casting aid as a second as a third level spell on all of you so you your hit point maximum increases by ten and if any of you do need healing she will cast prayer of healing on you all and so you each regain 18 hit points as well so we add is it 10 temporary points or no it's real hitch like it's real hit points it lasts for eight hours nice that's so strong now oh I feel better I feel like more good more good than usual yeah and your words caught up to you know a lot of changes right now and I'm losing track you're mostly shadow I'm mostly shadow and now I have more life so there are two passageways leading down into the catacombs one to the east well one to the the effectively the Northeast and one to the northwest which one will you take Bo use your nose I go up to the door and I the doors open and the passageways both go down a set of stairs you can actually smell in the air which which passage are you going to it was north east and north yes east or west facing east I'm gonna sniff at East East okay sniffing at the east you can smell you sniff down that way looking down the passageway and as I said as you look down the passage it's a high arched passage that descends down into the halls below and then it breaks out into a t-intersection yeah and at the intersection is a very large alcove we're on a great pedestal there is a ten-foot tall statue of a of a an angel she is there she bears the statue itself is made of marble and her wings are whole are pulled in close to her and in front of her she is buried she has her hand resting on in front of her on a massive circular shield made of bronze that's about four feet in diameter and in her other hand she holds a spear pointed towards the heavens are these marble things are these real items the spear and the the spear itself is about 12 feet long and this shield is four feet wide it's a huge spear a huge shield both of them are real looking down the other passageway there is a similar the other passageway is very identical again it's a high arched way that leads down to a and Angele another angel and he is he holds a sword in one hand that is as tall as he is he's about ten feet tall as well and another four-foot shield so his hands are balanced on the top about the shield and the weapon the the weapon is also real and although it appears to be made both their weapons be appear to be made of solid metal and both the shields are real as well so they there their hands are resting on the shields and then the base of the shield is held against the it's on the ground they're not like wielding the shield they're kind of resting and the you you recognize these these figures are very well-known in in myth these are the Archangels Michael and Gabriela and these two Archangels visit paladins when they're called to make it both mm-hmm I don't know if you want to try a four foot shield Pluto huh I want to see you try a 10 foot sword no God well said I'm not opposed to grave robbing I hear it's good luck I what I am NOT opposed to would be to remove the weapons from their hands I don't know if these good would come alive and I'll say it so front with the construction of both the hallways both the statues of the angels are visible from the top of the stairs do I smell any hints of difference in the air not up here nope they smelled the same Pluto I tried all right so a sword or spear yeah so Michael bearing the sword as to the West and Gabriella bearing the spear is to the east Pluto what weapon do you like more I grew up with the sword but I've really come accustomed to the spear it's the pastor Chris and if I had to say right now I think the sword or the way of the sword passed okay the past let's let's do it but you're going behind because you're having some Knoll mole going first yes I will go first that's what you smell um okay you ventured down the stairs these ancient stone stairs of the catacombs the walls and the stairs of the catacombs are filled with niches all in these niches hold urns and skulls there were mortal the the last remains of worshipers of the sacred fire often the skulls will have the names of who they were engraved on the skull or the urn will have a very small inscription and typically saying where how long they live many of those that are in the urns along here are people who were very devout in their lives and wanted to be interned in the chap the the cathedral itself as you head down to the stairs you can see the pad of the the the cylindrical pedestal upon which the statue of Michael rests and then surrounding Michael behind him is a semicircular alcove with again just rows upon rows of these niches that have urns and skulls inside them holding the last the last vessels of worshipers of the sacred fire there are two sets of stairs that descend again to the one to the north and one to the south and from the stairs you can see the light it just pours down like a beam into this chamber and rests upon basically fully illuminating Michael the statue of Michael and as it reaches him the beams spread out and filter down the hallways as well and they're in in various scattered directions and so from the landing here you can see that there is to the north there is a strong oaken door flanked by two larger niches of that have several full skeleton skeletal remains wrapped up and perched in the alcoves and then to the south is another set of these alcoves again with full full catacombs that have fully resting bodies wrapped up in them and then a set of double doors to the south I'm just throwing this out there there's a lot of skulls and bodies already if these things are gonna wake up we're horribly outnumbered that's why we just we should save all of our strength for running like as soon as we get these bones it's like in and out I'm really good at running it'd be like relay yeah I also feel a implies that we leave two of us behind well further behind well here's the deal I still have your your mom's cape right yeah yeah and to mention door it's like it's a doozy right thank you it could like I could just say 500 feet upstairs into where we started like I could take you and then pay I could run it you can teleport and we can also both tell it we can all teleport together you know I can't teleport into an area I can't see so I can't go upstairs and you're so fast there you were just bragging and stuff teleportation skills okay I could run it I can run it or do you want this shield shop and I put my hand on the shield I'm gonna call along I mean if you're offering it on your sticky as you touch the shield it you realize that it it has a hinge holding it in place on the ground and you Polly you see that there's machinery in Michaels arm and it articulates and the shield itself as you pull the shield forward Michaels arm extends forward or and if you push it back it does and the other side of the shield is well the outside of the shield is bronze the opposite side of the shield is covered in a highly reflective glass can I turn the shield around yes do it do it okay so I do that and I start like moving I'm looking around the room now for anywhere where I could point the light as you turn the shield around the back of the shield faces against the stairs coming down the light collects into the shield and across the 180 degrees where it's facing the light coming down the result is this beam of solid light eivol assault like that you can focus and point down either staircase well guys let's choose a direction yeah but should we do the other side as well yeah maybe just turned it on absolutely you're stronger than me okay I'm gonna run over to the other stairway mm-hmm and just just do exactly what Sebastian did and just turn it 180 so it's pointing yeah basically at the stairway so gap Gabriella's shield works the same way it can be rotated and turned around and as long as it faces towards the stairs coming down it collects the light and turns it into a being that you can focus down either set of stairs this could be part of the puzzle I just I know there was a possible I'm just assuming there's a puzzle now because of light shields yeah but also I mean maybe these undead don't like concentrated light beam lights so let's use it I bet you could we can reflect the light all the way down as we go that would be really so that's why we're gonna pick a direction and I'm gonna point the beam that way yeah and then we're gonna see if we can keep following the beam and I say I mean well I picked the sword so what do you guys pick north or so South runs with mouth and mouth is where I put my food that's actually the problem was logical I turned I struck a night earn that weren't wearing the south towards the south noise yeah I stand by my reasoning argue with it and it it illuminates the hull down here filling the whole hall and you can see that the height the door itself is quite high and so the focus point of the beam you've got a little bit of leeway into if you want to point it at the bottom of the door or like the top of the door because the doors themselves are a 10 feet tall I point it at the top of the door okay about the middle no I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna open the door while Sebastian is pointing it you push the doors open and there is another room beyond oh the whole time I'm thinking like your mouth so notes this is why she's our died did you June always be some food doo-doo-doo okay you open the double doors and the light hits upon the marbled mosaic floor here and refract all across the room dancing about this arched and vaulted room which has six large sarcophagi in it directly opposite you is another set of double doors the ceiling here is about 15 feet high arched and vaulted and once again there are well there are six large sigh cough a guy each bearing a carving showing those who occupied it above two of the sarcophagi the most elaborate ones one there is a banner hanging down in an elaborate tapestry that shows the works and Ministry of this flame keeper and opposite that claim keeper there is a sarcophagi of a paladin and behind him on the wall is another massive shield similar in design to the one held by Michael it's about three feet wide made of bronze and there are a pair of great swords crossed behind it there is a set of double doors directly opposite you and once again all three of this chamber are more niches filled with skulls going all the way up to the ceiling and then the arched and vaulted top way over top tells tells the story of Saint Durst a paladin who lived about five hundred years ago and was a rin were known for slaying dragons and so there are there are murals of Saint Durst's battles with various dragons culminating in his final Margaret um where he sacrificed his life to slay an ancient dragon that's like intense friends is another room and are you coming I run down the stairs all right I'm going into the room well I say do I check for traps err no I just stroll in I try to keep up with you come on behind them I walk into the room and I look over to that shield does it look like there's like a beam of light going right where the shield would be the light that you Shawn down into this room he hits the marble floor and it is just refracted all through the room and gone all in different directions so the beam has a fact that we ended ok well I mean I'm gonna check this shield out ok it makes sense if we can keep refracting I'll cover your word yeah making sure that none of these sarcophagi just fling open well while you're going over to the shield then I want to take a look at that sarcophagi does it look like it's been disturbed like the ones upstairs does it look like it's got just sold or moved at all no it does not okay I head over to the shield and kind of like peek behind it it's a massive shield that probably weighs about 25 pounds it's made of solid metal and as you pull it away from the wall it's hanging on the wall but behind it you can see the same reflective glass as on Michaels shield does it look like it's like movable or is it just something that comes off the wall you could pull it right off the wall I attempt to do so okay if this massive shield 3 feet in diameter off the wall and you are now carrying it gained some alphabet no yeah I'm like I'm like wobbling I wobble over to the center of the room where does it look like I look for where like the beam is hitting the floor mhm and I place the shield with allow you drag I drop it and then I slide it to where the light yes heaven it catches it catches the beam and because it's con it's it's not quite perfectly concave so once you've got it on the ground by the beam you can sort of hold it up and direct it and you can catch the light again and refocus it in different in different directions as long as they kind of point up a little bit guys I'm doing it okay I'm gonna run over and open those and go aim it this way and then I like prop it up so that it's can it shoot the beam at the next set of double doors uh yeah yeah you'd need to prop it up and hold the shield in place to get to catch it just right like if you'd leave it down there on the ground it it it just catches the beam and fires it up at the ceiling again can I use mould earth it's a prop it's not loose earth here well molar earth effect work stone no I could hold it for a minute I don't have anything that unless um I mean I got it just yeah but we want to leave it like that don't we we'll see I into an idea I reach into my tan bag and I remove a baboon [Laughter] I go his name is name um chimpanzee because he's a baboon what is his name chimpanzee because he's because that's not what he is okay agent pansy your job now is to hold the mirror like this I command him to hold the mirror okay slowly move out of the way and a hand in there to this chimpanzee his name is Jim a mystery but he is it better I confused does he follow orders is he good at it is he strong enough I guess I could speak to him if we really want but I don't want to waste this pose once look he he has a strength of a and he's it doesn't speak any languages I also have strings of eight and you have a strength of eight so yeah he's a struck that if I can prop this shield up yes so can he yeah doesn't work yeah okay yeah whoo he can hold the shield up and prop it up in the right direction he kind of monkeys about with it but you know if you still hey hey hey no monkeying around there yeah that's a good bet good chimpanzee that was a little worried about these uh sarcophagi but it seems like a non-issue let's open the next door cool yeah easy okay say what's the worst that could happen why it's like helper to it we're gonna be in like the next room and the lights gonna start to like shake and I'm gonna just yell listen I view mr. chimpanzee you hold it steady you want me to shuffle it on down shuffling shot Flynn okay all right so the door opens up and reveals the chamber beyond interesting Denton's so revealing reviewing it opens up into a 90-degree turn that goes back towards the east here the hallway continues but the it ends in one side what you end who's going first looks like yo I'll quickly sneak up behind him I'm like hey thought I was deleting this and there's a light following us right I guess I should be that a baboon is a light guide your path or something or something you know whatever whatever they say upstairs and then oh alright something like about the light yeah I think it was like I mean literally we're using light to guide our paths so I mean pretty on the nose okay for Truvia so this hallway ends in a very strange doorway it appears to be a door made of solid stone except in the center of the door there is a large circular aperture filled with glass at the light in it but the light in it surrounding the door is a golden filigree that's that on it is depicted st. but Rubio riding our Ghana oh my gosh oh my gosh I come stumbling in behind you guys Belu stay um I want to walk in and I want to look down the shorter hallway that ends is there anything there that I see that's shield like or that's gonna help reflect here the the hallway there's a torch sconce here and there are several great again catacombs with full-body skeletons that are wrapped up along the walls here is the torch lit the torch is not let none other torches down here look hey there were also torches flanking either side of the sarcophagi in that room that we're not lit Sebastian yeah remember when you burned the Queen's eyes out using a mirror yeah do you still have that yeah do you want to you want to do it oh yeah reflect the light down I pull out my mirror mm-hmm and I try to capture the beam of light and shine it towards the glass cool you grab the mirror and as you hold it hold it up to the beam your mirror isn't capturing the entirety of the beam and as you push it towards the the glass aperture the light beam that it sends is very thin and doesn't fully fill the entirety of the beam here you do have very good control with the mirror of the beam but you might need something bigger than your hand mirror for this probably need to find another shield yeah I start looking around there's no shield hanging on the wall or anything anywhere that would indicate that there would have been one or no searching searching around in the immediate vicinity not know well one thing we know is that there is the South way right and this is you said that this is marked quite obviously with like like the aperture does it have any like the the aperture itself surrounding it the circular pattern in the middle is about two feet in diameter and then it has this kind of focus depression that then ends in a crystalline piece of glass that is multifaceted and about ten inches in diameter in the center circular could we use your drift globe absolutely that's a great idea because it has the daylight first I'll try yeah just light if I if I turn on the light from the drift globe so just casting the light spell and I want to do it bright light in a twenty foot radius and dim light for another twenty could we even could we even take the the shield from the baboon shine it on the shield and direct it still using that so it's more concentrated but we're not having to rely on getting all the shields light from all the way again sorry so the light is coming all the way from the top right now shining yeah would it not be better to take the shield that the baboon has put it down the hallway and shine the drift globe light from there yeah let's do that look we can I can even stand in the hallway with it and shine it right into the into the shoe a blue and light into that yeah yeah can you call the bowtie have you all Romeo d six please one six four that's a spread we gotta get spread going on so as you as you pull out the drift globe have you activating the drift globe now yes okay yeah so I'm turning on the light spell and we were trying that we're messing with it we're like talking amongst each other bringing the / well I feel like we're all huddled around here trying to figure out yeah how to get light as the I'm still here carrying the shoe yeah as the light spell emanates down this hallway there is a clarion ringing as the light shines upon all the niches through through this area and one of these skulls gasps I turn the light off and as it gasps out quite suddenly the like a chorus of sighs the other skulls and bodies down here begin to cry out gasping and sighing as if the light is like air to them this is why we use a beam and they like it though it's nice as they as the gasping resonates down the hall and continues through all the various cullen and even the some of the jars of ashes shake at the gasping you can hear the sound of grinding stone as something pushes against one of the sarcophagi get out of there roll for initiative we figured out the puzzle 70 yeah Sebastian 16 so there's Vale 21 I gasped just to fit in I'm like oh okay bail as the gasping resonates outward you see one of the skulls in one of the niches begin to lift itself up and take to the air as one of the as several of the other wrapped skeletal bodies push their way out of their burial cloths and step into the hallway as well so we're not killing them right I'm killing whatever's in front of me I mean they'll get back up but maybe we just need to leave them in the dark I'm gonna give the baboo in the your club and just let it run through wake everything up don't do as good as dead we're hearing this happening and their sarcophagi is moving maybe what they need is a little bit of darkness Oh God baboon he was just trying to help he just wanted to be part of the team well there's one behind me no the floating Scout and their gasping so that's not weird or anything watching a scull gasp for life now the question is do we go forward or back forward or back so many we didn't jamie holy water either I don't have my my holy club oh oh good good good good good all right so first up is Vail so as a [Music] I'm going to turn around and immediately say true you know maybe it's thigh maybes JA we don't know and as I do this I'm like taking my bow out did they say anything to me one of them whispers out okay no so no all right and I take my bow and I fire at this guy in the corner cool I have a wand for sure Oh critical miss wah-wah I'm shaking a little bit cuz I'm like freaked out by these skeletons coming off the wall 20 yeah right is it hits well done make sure the eight from my dread ambusher the skeletal bodies that step out of the the sarcophagi and the cat and as they pull the the sheen of the their burial robes off of them they pull up the weapons we kept beside them several of them carry Spears and others carry swords in two hands so I got twenty damage on this guy right here alrighty the arrow resounds out smashing bone and flecks of armor but he still stands I mean just go back to sleep we're just so we'll leave the light off it's fine and I take my last shot Adam with a 22 to it that is a hips smash him with another arrow for 23 damage collapses into a pile of bones and armor on the ground was that a loud clatter sky well he's probably gonna come back so I would not recommend we stay here for these guys yep please leave it wherever they're where they are so as my movement now that he's gone use my feline agility and double my movement but I'm also going to use my cunning action to if I disengage as my bonus action is it disengaging only one person or as the rest of my movement when you disengage there have to be bases in you your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the chart cool so I'm gonna disengage and I'm going to start running back through the room but I'm gonna stop at the double doors on the other side and they say come on guys this obviously was not the right way to go you have a speed of how far can you go this turn 60 feet 60 feet okay thank you that room is 60 feet itself suggest okay so maybe just shy I'm probably bit closer that's okay okay first not really that's a Peter okay alrighty as you cross the room you can see another skull rising up out of the niches and it and as it howls at you beams of flaming light come from its eyes towards you and Zao you are shot scient the one on the opposite burn room and it gets a 24 and an eighth two hits 24 hits cool that is going to be 15 points of the fire damage oh and as it cries out around it forms a corona of brilliant light that is almost blinding to look at the skull floating out and as such well this Corona surrounds it attacks against it will have disadvantage the other one that flies out fires its beams of light towards pollute oh and one and it let's see yeah it actually cries out with kind of this wrathful rage and a blossom of brilliant energy explodes down the end of the hallway and Sebastian and Pluto both of you can make dexterity saving throws oh my favorite as this column of radiant flame bursts through the the edge of the that hallway 14:11 okay Sebastian you fail Pluto you succeed oh I just a flute oh no this is a flame strike spell what this is the spell flame strike and that's not you each you clearly you succeeded and the total is 8 so it is 12 radiant damage and 13 fire damage I want to use my shield of Asia yeah yeah you can oh and I and I you you you standing in the way and with my shield all the fire gets absorbed and you're just kind of covered in fire and like I still get hit oh yeah I know I don't I jumped in front of you and a little bit that got past me you block with your shield yeah cool I'm fine and I I'm charred and sad but with the radiant you're less shadow now that hurts me more it is your turn Liu I collapse in front of you I turn off the drift globe okay is that what does that take to you is that your action bonus action action okay I'm gonna unguessed the light spell whoops okay and [Music] ciao here give me with you um I'm I'm gonna stand over my friends burned corpse okay alright and I'm reading sebastian you're up as Pluto stands over my corpse oh one more thing one more thing sorry I'm gonna command with my bonus action my baboo and I go boom career okay bring the bring the shield okay the make up wisdom saving throw for the baboon it is very terrified because there's four skeletons oh no yeah whatever it was he failed it starts freaking out it drops the shield and it leaps on top of one of those sarcophagi and starts screaming and making baboon noises so Sebastian it's your turn now it was standing over me heroically I crawl out from under his legs and start running oh wait we were supposed to run and looks like I'm gonna get to about here and it's gonna get a little dicey so I pull out my wand and I throw a skeletal hand towards the closest skeleton and I cast chill touch nice not the bad touch twice six that is definitely a hit thought so that was sad that was really sad okay so that does two damage so it's more like a chill tickle yeah I I'm panicked and I throw the hand and it like brushes his cheek gently but he now does have disadvantage on attacks against me okay well that's relevant because it's their turn anything else I'm a movement to base myself of water I just brushed I brushed his cheek and now I'm running towards him screaming in it in an attempt to be intimidating okay these descale the skeletal paladin's each two of them turn towards each of you closing in on on you both and as the skeletons in circle around veo and in circle around sebastian blocking the doorways Oh see smart smart I'm dead same with with veo is it really dark in here now no because the light is still coming in from above illuminating around okay and so to attack their attacks made against each of you they like a ten and a eight and a 15 and a 10 one of them hits one hit the 15 points okay and that is going to be 11 points of slashing damage is one of the great swords comes down upon you Sebastian I get a natural one and an 18 and a 8 and an 18 two of those head okay so you take ten points from the first grade sword and eight points from the spirit as they turn around and almost as if this ancient battle knowledge has come back to them as they turn and though there is this kind of the their skeletal forms have the bearings of noble warriors used to fighting in formation as this knowledge is come towards them but as they move in fight it's all the delight in their the hits of the skull illuminate like eyes that are almost dull this dull golden light and then to against Bluto getting a big ol 14 and 8 and an 18 and a 23 23 heads so one of the great swords comes down for only five damage that kind of just chinks through batters kind of the pauldron of your armor with the great sword yeah and with that we go to the top of the round with Vale in this room how tall is the ceiling 15 people okay I want to still start to make my way out of the room calling to the guy saying guys come on they're not gonna go down on Troy and I want to use my bonus action again to disengage can I run like between them with an acrobatics check yes do it 10 10 looking for more than that oh so you'll you'll need to spend - you'll need to spend movement to get past them okay as a result so you need to spend half your you either need to square it out and move around them yep because you can't go through their space they can't go through their space okay yeah then I'm going to go around them so I've 30 feet of movement and then I just start taking shots I'll start with the guy in the walls and use cutting action to disengage its engage at okay 23 that is a hit nice BAM 22 damage that actually sails right through him and he collapses to the ground whoa oh nice and then I take a shot at the other guy yep 13 hit it does not penetrate the chainmail armor protecting him okay how much movement times all all 30 that's it oh I'll stay there yellow the guys come on guys it's already I've been stabbed on the ground these skulls it hovers around and it turns and fires more rays of radiant light towards you veil and I guess at it getting a 20 and a 11 to hit 20 hits for 11 points of radiant damage and the other one fires towards pollute Oh getting a 18 and a 14 it Murph's deflected rays of light with my shield Ludo you're up and I'm gonna just start swinging at these monsters cool I'm precision strike to make that an 18 that is it hit for I'm using my longsword for 15 damage it cracks through bone in metal but it's still the creature still stands and I'm gonna swing again for like a 25 to hit for 12 damage and the second blow sends the ribcage and femur scattering across a scattered across the floor yeah and then I I'm gonna shield bash this one cool way I get a 6 I get a 21 said I'm going backwards towards the skull man and I run towards and I get myself right up there against these two dudes cool did your turn Sebastian I reach out for Pluto's hand and then I I look at him I make eye contact with them and I'm like I'm sorry and I snap my fingers and I'm going to cast darkness oh he's fire balling himself no no past darkness on myself using my to sorcery points understand yeah I scream no I'm trying not to create an incident but I'm making it very dark for a moment and then with that darkness I'm hoping they can't see me in my magical darkness cuz that would suck I'm gonna make a run for it okay that does promote they can't see you so that doesn't provoke an opportunity attack you're casting the darkness on yourself yeah yeah okay and I think that's my whole turn okay running so you just see a blob of darkness moving through the room okay these skeletons two of them are three of them are down yes oh no okay [Music] one of them gets back up the bones collecting together as it as it stands back up and takes up its weapon but that's its entire turn and the two then see so having Sebastian disappear behind them and this another large imposing man now standing in the doorway they race into attack getting a getting an 18 23 and eight and a 21 to hit 21 and 23 hit okay it's gonna be eight points of damage from the great sword and from the spear another eight points of damage now the other stumbles about in the darkness in a random direction because he doesn't know where things have gone and so he stumbles backwards and kind of bumps into sebastian and swipes while widely with his spear with disadvantage and it whistles by you sebastian through the darkness but does not hit seeing it coming i step out of the way cool and we go to top the round with vale I can tell you continue to back up and now I'm like oh Allah the darkness in front of me and I don't want to go too far is this skull included in it yes ok I mean is it that's right it's on the periphery so I'll say no the skull is not it is very bright and glowy I take some shots at it but it's with disadvantage yes that's correct make some shots do my best still got a 19 [Music] 23 okay whoa the arrow resounds through the skull breaking out the back half of it and sending parts of its face scattering all over the place but it still floats forward take my other side of it oh that one's less fun eight damn it alright it's a hit oh yeah it made its concentration check on Blair it did okay no it sails past and I'm like waiting anxiously to see like what happens with the darkness because I'm like I know Pluto's back there I know you're you're on your way but I'm like come on guys I'm kind of starting to like pace a little bit on the spot the flame skulls it comes around the corner and otherwise it's raised at Pluto ah neither would [ __ ] they sail past oh the other comes flies out of the darkness towards veo getting a critical hit no and though that is going to be five eight [Music] five plus eight plus nine is 22 five plus eight plus nine yeah is 22 so a searing beam of concentrated light sails towards you and strikes you for twenty two radiant damage are you still alive five eight eight eight healthy Oh is one more beam which is a natural ones oh you want her to perfectly balanced okay they oh you're up oh no sorry no it's sexy pluto's turn I'm sorry I got out of work come back blob of darkness I'm start swinging at this thing in front of me getting a twenty four to hit for ten damage nice and a sixteen to hit it is a hit for twelve damage the two slight sword swipes cut off its head and take it out of the legs and it collapses to the ground and I shield shove the other one for a sixteen I get a ten and I push it out of the way and I just start booking it towards the darkness in the animal feeling warm cover of darkness wildly before I know I can't run towards the light and I know it takes a bonus action to command my baboon but I still yell out baboon help me okay even though he must be mr. memories after you and grabs onto your leg in the darkness finds you find your voice just latches onto your leg he's just like and I'm like I'm doing like the dad crawl with like a toddler on his leg where it's just like you're walking and there's like a thing on you okay the skeleton let's do any I've got what about maybe Oh Sebastian I'm sorry I am so in the middle of the darkness I hear Pluto running towards me and I reach out my arm and I'm just like Pluto take my hand okay sorry baboon I'm gonna keep moving I'm guessing that I can't move him with me though but I'm imagining that I'm reaching out my hand and backing up okay oh there's a flaming skull thing in the way yeah but they can't see you in the darkness as long as you don't move through their squares can I move around them yeah you can go the diagonal - yep cool we got ya Thursday yes rushes towards man am i cool so I I do that and then I'm going to throw up my wand and cast a fire bolt at the flame Scott it's alright I don't know if it's immune to fire because it's a flame flaming skull but I hope my fire is evil and it's fire is good and that will balance it out 21 it hits but it absorbs all the fire sorry figure that out is not damaged by the flames that was a bad move I regret everything fire these skeletons so I've got three down yes none of them get back up so all the darkness left have a baboon on me I reached out my hand and said grab my hand the skeletons all of them rush in pursuit the two the two in the hallway these two they get back down and they go back into their their little layers but the other two that are still in this chamber rushed towards pollute oh hi and though there is a flurry of Steel one spear strike gets a 21-2 hit Oh for eight points of damage oh the rest do not find their targets it's my baboon scared them yep yep top the round Vale you were in the darkness I move backwards okay out of the darkness yeah the darkness envelops this hallway and in fact actually as a result because of where the darkness is positioned now it is blocking the light from getting into this room and thus it is now pitch black down in in in that room oh so I'm just gonna roll there the skeletons attacks against you a little with advantage actually it doesn't make a difference Oh with advantage because they cuz they can see in the dark and you can't I really can't yeah you know that about me yeah so that room is completely so basically as Sebastian went out that way the room completely blacked out and you just got stabbed in the dark I was sorry before I did it it's my escape plan and as that happens I'm just like I'll make it up eventually and I take a healing potion okay Algie suppose my feeling is 10/10 yeah the the flame skull it they both focus their fire on Ludo in the darkness see I would have the darkness it moves into the room oh there we go through a barrage of flame I get a critical hit and an 18 is my next highest so the crate is not a crit thanks Sebastian is dead and 18 misses do you take 10 radiant damage at least it lights my way yes it does I can see as the the flame skull comes into the room because the flame skulls illuminate a 15 foot radius out from them so as it comes out of the darkness it illuminates the room again so actually didn't get advantage okay so I got a red car no no so it shot me and I see the light where it comes from and I go oh that's where I had to go darkness and light why you got to be so confusing Aveo drank a potion happily rose up so the room is illuminated because the flame skulls are now in it and I'm surrounded yeah cool I start swinging at the closest one I get a natural one I'm panicking and then oh uh a twenty seven to hit base or it damage already is that when I even touched no no no and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to push it away okay I get a ten I got a nine whoo I push it away and I think I'm gonna take at least an opportunity to attack from that one okay as I run it gets a six to hit and the baboon's attached to me yeah got my Bibles race out into the darkness you hear the creaking of bones and the sliding of stone as the disturbed guardians return to their slumber I closed the double torus I leaned against the wall I mean they warned us it was gonna happen I I dismissed my darkness fell as I closed the doors and I look at you and I'm like I said take my hand I'm holding my monkey ever so closely and I go it's okay buddy it's okay are you gonna ask me if I'm okay you're fine no I'm not okay I'm not okay yeah I'm actually totally fine after I started complaining about myself I turn in see van and she's like covered in blood and your blood is that skeleton you guys leave the shield in the room yeah you did they didn't wake up until we messed up the light situation so if we just walk back in there calmly and pick the shield up it should be okay okay I like the element of surprise and so I say surprise and I open the door and I'm gonna run back in and try to grab the shield okay did you open the door roll for initiative oh no just you just you for now oh no I get it - oh wait no I get advantage I get a a okay so as you rush into the room to grab the shield one of the sarcophagi begins to push itself push open again and you are able to run into the room grab the shield and run back out and as it does so it carries out and it hurls the spear towards you getting a 12 to hit the Flex against you as it throws this spear towards you I picture like hitting the door as you close like that spear gets stuck there and then you hear that whap of a flap flap as two more spears are thrown towards it you guys want to try the I'm another person I may need a nap first I do another tiny hut that we can use yeah yeah I always have a tiny hug can we use the tiny do you guys want to go upstairs for a minute and uh yeah we're pretty closed up stairs I think were like way down in the deep upstairs I just got stabbed straight through my shoulder yeah oh my gosh back up and take a short rest okay in that case this sounds like the perfect place for us to take our short rest so we'll see you after the break

world's greatest role-playing game it contains now with all their stretch goals over 55 ready to run encounters designed for the way Dungeon Master's actually run their game check them out now on Kickstarter it's only running for another couple a couple more weeks here in 2019 I tell oddest 14th or 15th I believe and then it's all over so be sure to get there yep it's still August 18th pardon me get out get on there check them out it's a real great value and an awed by some awesome folks in our community with that let's return to the ruins we are underneath the great Cathedral of st. Petruchio where our heroes sit at the steps around the Great Basin of the altar licking their wounds after a run-in with the deathless Guardians beneath so so we went west last time correct you went west and then seven so south to the west not the best I think what we need to do is you know head to the east because that's probably where the least amount of damage will happen and then if we go south still follow the mouth it's a my tummy because I always follow my tummy when I'm doing directions what do you guys think is this how you've navigated all of all of dragon hair are you serious like this this is how are you doing is this is this like how your navigation tool you're just using the RAM it's just random finding out the trade secrets is horrifying baby have you just rhymed your way through survival for 15 years look where it's gotten me hmm I cannot hurt you to not be mad at it are you theory and by theory I mean it it's a proven theory because we just experienced it we probably need to use the natural light and no more drift globes no lighting torches if we disturb a room it's bad mm-hmm if we can just navigate through here using the light to guide us we just need to pick up every shiny shield that we see and place it I mean we're gonna carry the shield with us I'm not gonna carry there's a baboon that's gonna carry it okay it's true exist Oh true these are all good questions they're good okay got beat around a bit by Saladin okay when I say take my hand I expect you to take my hand just Oh it's listening you mean no I was totally ignoring you in reading about my my baboon I don't do any take that attitude with you yeah it's gonna down other opposite corridor like the like the way to the west these halls have the same architecture the skull filled niches and catacomb catacomb filled walls on the great statue of the spear wielding art Archangel Gabriel bearing forth a shield of the same design as the one born by Michael as you come down the steps you can see that there are passageways leading both to the north and the south this time to the south there is a simple large wooden door singular door but to the north the doorway is large and made of stone construction similar to the door the way that you saw deeper into the complex this door also has a large aperture and a circular pattern to it and with the circular gemstone to it but it is engraved with the coat of arms of the long castles oh my gosh we're not we're not we're not here for any fun castles are we I feel like anything leading us to the Von Kessler's might give us some information about my dad I think we should check it out I'm just worried that we're gonna have to fight a whole bunch of undead Vaughn castles but I don't get it we just don't turn on the drift Club we don't turn on the torches yeah what's the worst they could know turn it to the Vaughn Castle symbol okay if you turn it to the Vaughn Castle symbol the aperture in the center suddenly flares with light spins around and these circular blades focus the light and the doorway then rotates and opens after you guys least we know that works yeah I competently walk in I walk in behind him slightly less confident my bedroom trailing carrying a bronze shield I close I'm still standing by the shield watching you guys walk in he's like doing like the like the the same kind of thing you were doing like this shuffle like it's trying but you have is best well those look like scary things I'm not nervous you're nervous yeah I'm not nervous spirits I am nervous I'm nervous I I come like poke my head and so I do come up here [Music] I like poke my head and I'm like I'm I am nervous guys I'm really nervous I'm not worried what I am thinking is as long as whatever we do in here we do it quickly okay I feel like time moves against us in this you come down to a large chamber a large l-shaped chamber at the base of the stairs as you come down in a large alcove against the wall is a massive construct of stone and wood that appears like a massive 12-foot tall night of Dragon hein it bears it holds a great San iron great sword in front of it and you can see around in the plates between its armor are the mechanical gears and something about its construction is reminiscent of the executioner and there are two of them flanking the sides of a massive vault door that bears a double aperture in the middle so this l-shaped hallway at the bend of the L is where this door is diagonally and rate opposite that I the door is a large plaque upon which our two hooded figures holding a a large metal plaque that is made of the same reflective material but also has a list of writing on it and it is directly opposite the doorway that has the two aperture lenses on it the doorway itself being some 14 feet tall and this chamber itself rising up to a height of 20 feet the two guardians flanking this doorway are inert and opposite this room is another doorway of the same construction as the doorway that just opened but the aperture is facing the other way interesting okay so it is not the receptacle of the light but the you can see that it was that the receptacle of the light that was facing the other way was on the opposite side of the store so we probably need to balance the light that way as well well that door would open from the other side yeah but I'm thinking to open the big door there's two two beams in here to open this room on the other hand does not have the niches filled with skulls rather this the walls here are murals depicting the line of the Von Kessler's I observe anything on here do I recognize the Von castles from there is there are several of the murals here are several of the walls here are empty they're meant to be locations for the jet for future generations seems like the Von Kessler's were planning on at least another 20 generations and the current of the last generations of on Kessel's have not been painted here yet so yeah cuz that would have happened so suddenly right like they they wouldn't be I I walk into the room and like keeping my eyes on the two giant statues I like kind of move across the room to where the the statue of cross from the door is holding the scripture I turn to look at it can I read it yeah the in script the inscription reads that actually the same passage that that Ofili read quoted earlier when darkness bars the way only by the light is the truth for the old holy s--t it gives us an indication of what needs to be done so i think if we if we can find some more shields and we can direct the light from both sides this way then maybe we can open this door the light from the statue that opened this door where is it resting it rests as it bounces down into the middle of the chamber it can be adjusted such that it hits the middle of the floor between the door and the statue itself this may not be the best idea I've ever had but can we get baboon to reflect the reflect the light onto the statue that looks exactly like the thing we're terrified of there's a statue on either side of the door yes if we bounce the light on the statue maybe that opens the door in the middle do you mean the the actual Guardian created well yeah you're saying that the light bounce is right and it hits the floor yeah so I'm wondering it reflecting it at the statue I would think you need to reflect to the or how does that angle work yep well we would hit it against the this thing that Sebastian is looking at and that would reflect it back into the door right it's got like reflectors the the inscription itself the the interpreter self is made of reflective material and perhaps it could in fact bounce the light okay okay then can we try bouncing the light at that I want to try bouncing it but I'm also worried that maybe not doing all of it at once yeah might also cause an issue exactly I think maybe keeping in mind that this room is the double aperture so like week we I think we can do it it's just that we want to get the other one at the same time that's what I think we're also just assuming that it needs both maybe this room just has two entrances no so the the main door in the middle has two apertures yeah and are they I was positioned above each other beside each other within each other like are they like depth they're actually positioned one atop the other yeah yeah so light and the last time we play with the light that things happened I pull out my drift globe no put that away so then if we go back up over to the other side that we died at but this we didn't die no the opposite way here we go the opposite we go north so oh yeah South is for the mouth North is for though because we just went north here yeah true true true true true so we are to go for no for once again it rhymes so therefore it has to be correct but shouldn't we check the area too going south to the Truvia where we saw to see if it read connects on the other side well we need we need to pick like are we more interested in finding out what this room is all about or are we more interested in going elsewhere I think if we can get the true vo zone then they can do their magic upstairs and then we can explore a little bit down here once this place is secured will they let us mess around down here I mean it could be I guess before we take the bone up don't we do this part that's what I'm thinking I'm ordering like it's not every day I get free rein stomping through the cathedral crypts what do you think Pluto I'm kind of with before we get the bones I want to get I want to explore this I really need to know the von Kessel lineage only because I am worried that if we get the bones and they might need our help upstairs and then be like can you guys help us we're bone collectors gosh okay we'll do this room first so you think we should die if we all die all you get to say I told you so okay okay no no so West is best let's go west go west so we go back up come baboon down the baboon in there yeah you can leave we should take it doesn't mean just in case we need it yeah he's probably knocked down and now we're going north north to go floor on the other hallway north to go for okay are you loving these set changes I am loving these set changes okay so you go back around the other way to the a little behind the scenes montains to assemble these all by hand every day he spends every waking hour assembling assembling Torben for so many hours for us and sometimes when he builds big things we don't even go in them so then he he just has to he says it for him I remember once in one of our own campaigns where I built this massive dungeon you're like no we wanted to do a completely different it's for the entire afternoon building like and that is about the time Monty start asking us what do you want to do yeah what are you guys thinking of doing what are you thinking of doing because I'm gonna spend hours building it and you jerks okay never called me a jerk say did we ever did that to you no right no you guys pick up on mic use my cues are very obvious a big week you can go left or right Oh back there soon anyways when we awaken the goal and things when we what what oh I mean we might make them here we might accidentally wake them up like that's just how this is how we do north to go forth whoops also apps also our minis oh oh yeah Adam also before we go this way I point the shield sure that way where's mine you open the doorway so you've now gone back across they just kind of wave at them and we wave at a feel yeah we're like hey we're still working on it the bones weren't this way so you go back down the other way and opening the door you open into a circular chamber in this circular the doorway here is quite high much higher than the other than the others leading in it's this longer narrow door about ten feet high and it opens up into a circular room with four stone benches surrounding a circular basin a large circular font of water and you can and the water actually smells very fresh and hanging over the water in the center of the fountain is is what you can see is an angel an archangel known as Saint Lucius also known as the angel of morning and morning not as in morning but as morning like crying sad and his wings are kind of furled down in collapsed along the statue and he is his hands are out about three feet aside him kind of in in this in raised up of a three feet apart almost as if he is crying out to to the god I like to the heavens themselves why as he kneels out over over the water pulling the the way the statue is built is its touch with marble and the water is coming from his eyes it's flowing out like tears into the end of the pool I walk up and first of all he said it's fresh but I just want to significant they said that if it's something else it'll smell dinner silver powder in the water holy water and silver dust dust yeah dust but I want to like kind of Trump in the fountain and look at the statue a bit closer um because I want to see if it's wide enough where or it were he'll hold the shield did she just die out in the holy water and the arms would fit the shield this the statue itself you can see there is underneath the water there are four handles on the base of the statue Oh guys help me rotate the statue so that its arms face that other door yeah mom you just do it we can help yeah I mean there might be like I'm more like too many cooks in the kitchen sort of thing I mean if I don't have to go trudging through holy water right now I'm cool I got this and I shake a little bit I mean I'm sure we can yeah well can you try to move the statue try um can we put the shield in a first one yeah baboon call him by his name sorry chimpanzee I hand the shield to fail I'm very weak strike how about you just put it up there Pluto okay I won't hand it up I hear you lift with your back not your legs yeah now so you put the shield in the statue and it it does it fits in perfect and working together you can rotate it in in the pool of water okay guys I'm standing I'm standing on the outskirts okay so you aim it towards the exit Dori the that okay second or the beam of like it's a regular door level doesn't have an aperture on it that's fine it's Costin aim it towards the door is there anything else in this room I'm just gonna take a turn around the room just to candelabra and this room again does not have niches in it for any sort of any burial started it doesn't look like it very over okay Pluto what happens if you drink the water don't drink the water the silver in the ceiling overhead is arched and vaulted and it depicts 12 stations known as the the twelve mercies of the martyrs this religious scenes where various martyrs of the sacred fire granted mercy upon evildoers it's holy water so it's got to be good for you I want to fill my water to you with it no it's got nothing it the silver so do so do you miss me do you do so okay and then I'm not gonna drink it yet I'm gonna save it for splashing on the end dead did you just collect a vial yeah okay and where are you gonna aim the beam right at the door right at the doors going on wait let's aim it just off to the side of the door and then go through the door and then we can always aim it after but what if it starts something that we don't know well the thing that I'm more worried about is usually if we aim it straight down the hallway it doesn't hit any of the skeletons if we aim it off to the side I'm worried about it like no I mean like just to the against a wall here in this room okay so like we open the door see what's behind it and then we can a mess and then move the statue so we're gonna just point it at a wall I'm also gonna film my water skin with holy water okay so you point it at the wall yeah cool and then I'm gonna open the door you open the doorway and it after a short hallway it opens up into another large room oh good you're facing good facing somebody left this in disarray [Music] interesting we probably need more shields don't we I mean I'm hoping there's a shield somewhere in this room oh well not necessarily okay you open the doorway and before you is a large scriptorium the walls are lined with cabinets and bookshelves and in the center of the room are three large scribes tables filled with books dried out in pink wells and various tools of inscription and writing as you come into the room you can see that there are the desiccated corpses of two monks sprawled on the ground and what looks like splayed on one of the desks slumped over is another hooded dead buck I'm gonna approach no opposite you the door opens directly across is the other side of the door bearing the script inscriptions of alone castles and another turn point as well another alcove that leads to another this other alcove with an altar on it that also has an aperture shields there is a lot of debris and mess all over this room it's possible that searching through it there might be something of that nature but in the in the room itself there are no shields I have an idea yeah let's let's see a prayer for our friends monks sprinkle some water sprinkle some water on them see some words that are fairly read taught us I do you guys want to each take one yeah yeah three months okay do you have some holy water yeah I I actually as you as you asked that I'm like yeah yeah and I back up and I scoop my water skin of course all right I mean Pluto you say the words and all this do the sprinkling what's the what's the thing that we read in the inscription the the light in in times of darkness may the light be the truth mmm-hmm yeah that's nice that sounds nice and I do a couple [Music] lights and I'm and I'm which of you are taking which there's two on the ground and one on the ground I'll take the one slumped over okay the desk okay as you go up to the desk and approach the slumped over monk at the desk and begin to open on stop or the the holy water to pour it it shudders violently throwing back its cloak and it turns to face you his skin has become gray and desiccated and his face looks like somebody took their fingers put them in his mouth and his hands and hold his face open like body and his jaw hangs down and his eyes are pulled down like almost like clay into this long horrific visage and as he comes towards you you see beneath his hand as he rears up his hand you can see that a piece of delirium has been embedded in his the flesh of his hand and he turns and he screams out roll for initiative man 23:08 I got a twenty ok guys i rolling back is turned and I think it's you screaming what is it what is yeah what's going on I'm not turning around what's happening he turns up and he screams out and as you see this horrific visage though it is your first turn to act and as you look upon his face first of all you can feel an aura of death emanate from him as if he what ever his behaviors become as the rejection of all light and you need to make a constitutional saving throw six-six okay you will reduced to zero hit points it screams out your heart stops and veo almost Shooks of white appear in beiow as she drops to zero at points what just happened what help Pluto I I scream at it - okay I'll scream back at it as a sweetie you make a constitution saving throw don't feel it I get an 18 you succeed and you gird yourself against it as it screams out at you is it a spell this is not a spell I'm going to the thing I've learned about screaming is if it's decapitated it has trouble screaming I get a 14 it that is a hit for 12 damage okay by which weapon are you building my sword still okay the sword crashes into it and doesn't quite find purchase in its skin oh this isn't good I drop the sword and I pull out my spear and I get in a I use precision for 18 to hit that is a hit for nine damage okay a spear and did that do something it did okay jams through its flesh and this black fluid leaks out of its corrupted body I'm going to action surge I'm going to use a bonus action to shove it on the ground getting a 21 it falls to the ground I run over it and I run to Vale I'm gonna just grab her and I'm gonna dimension door into the other room with my baboon yeah Oh going taking Vale out of the room yeah bail bail bail bail okay okay so I just I'm standing there with my back turned or whatever is happening and over my like on one side I look over and just see veo drop and then see you I hear screaming and see you run over grab Vail and disappear and I'm just staying alone in this room and I haven't turned around to look at whatever screaming behind me yet it's on the ground now it's fine alrighty Sebastian X tup is the monkey it pulls back the hood and you can see it's oh god oh god oh god the this phase where all the hair has fallen out of it the this faceless creature whatever he has become is an abomination and an wave of necrotic power washes out and emanates from it and as it does so it its withering gaze rips into you Sebastian anika Constitution saving through you got this you got this you got this [Music] 14 you succeed you take half damage from its withering gaze which is six psychic which ends up being a total of nine psychic damage they're starting to chronic damage God on the kosis it is your turn Sebastian if you wish now that you are aware of what's going on you may avert your gaze to avoid looking upon its face otherwise you must make a constitution saving throw do reflections count I wouldn't know that if I pull out I pull out my mirror you need to decide before you need to decide before you pull the mirror out you're gonna look at it or not yeah but is me pulling the mirror looking at it or not because I could say no I don't want to look at it and then pull the mirror or does that count as looking at it there's only one way to find it okay then I'm gonna try it I pull my mirror out and I look at the reflection of the mirror okay the power as you as you pull pull the mirror out its power is crushing as you are in its aura and I'm gonna let you make your saving throw with advantage [Music] we have a 16 you could succeed you're saving crow well you look at it in the in the mirror you see it you can you can still see it so you can still target it as as normal but I'm still going to give you disadvantage on attack rules against it because you're like trying to do like that yep I'm so I'm looking in a mirror and I pull out my wand and I point behind me and I'm like aiming it in the mirror and I'm just gonna be like all right and let's do this and I scorching ray behind ya scorching rain number 111 sounds passed I really know okay that was a warning shot and number 2 crit yes all those days now I hate to be they get that guy but aren't you rolling with this advantage I am what did you get then anyways that's it 20 it hits it's still here that's not a crit I saw other dice sorry that's fair that's fair I'm forgetful and was so excited by the 20 then I forgot what I was doing okay great cool three damage it seems like it's resistant to fire so it's one damage cool I I realized this and I'm like well it still got one beam left naked good then I start moving towards Dora smart smarter and I'm going to fire my last beam with disadvantage getting a 10 it is a mess and then I've run out of the room to go to the top of the run with veo who's got to make a death saving trophy 13 dried I think I don't know not unless you have some dad nope 13 okay yeah it's a success so you don't die you know you're up I'm gonna feed veo a health potion okay one of the greater kind okay and then I'm gonna use my bonus action to command the baboon to turn the mirror into the room the light will okay Ruth okay make a strength check for the baboon the baboon is so strong he's as strong as both of you guys and he gets it too but it doesn't move enough to go in he tries pushing really hard but he's not strong enough to push the pedestal and that's very cool well actually after I feed bear the thing I do that thing can I kind of push her out of the way with me that carry us like I want to be out of the way of the doorway yeah yeah eyes roll your this this creature the sunlight emanates from the shield regardless and and lights extends light of filling the entire circular room and it it howls towards the light but it will not advance closer towards the light since all of you are out of it's direct sight and in there the sunlight you just hear it screech screeching in the room beyond as it at the epithelium might add [Music] Sebastian I say screw it and I jump into the holy water and I help the baboon pull it so that can shield phases in to make a strength check so what I'm best at this is your this is your bread and butter a 12 do you want to push it all the way to the it so that it lines up with the camera or do you just want to push it so that it shines into the room I want it so that it's like beaming that way yes but I'm asking you just because the the door opposite has the the the has an aperture in it I just want to shine it into the room okay so you shine the beam of light in the room and actually with the angle I think the beam he hits the creature directly so like a brilliant Sun beam striking it I'm gonna have you make an attack roll with your magic ability modifier 19 that is a hit roll 68 radiant - yeah - three I have four I have one how many six forty 16 68 yeah there you go this makes up for the crit that I took away 32 damage yeah it is reduced to dust oh I'm never blessing anything again that really turns you off religion yeah not the light yeah I just listened to my tummy and nothing else no thanks for coming back for me oh I didn't I know you left me completely alone in there with that thing it's okay I handled it joint mints is 18 right yeah okay I'm gonna take one of these ointments yeah I didn't want to bail but no you say Vail I'm like in seriousness I appreciate you and you followed you in you and the baboon killed everything I mean I hold up my hand high five the baboon he for sure high-fives you he's excited his name is chimpanzee oh yeah he's name is Jim busy and now he hugs your leg you know he's holding on you're like Pluto can you uh nope that's his choice he's a sentient creature yeah I stumbled towards the statue and try to push it I'm like can we just open this other door already to get out of this church I'm gonna cautiously enter the room again because there's there's a chance that there's something else in here so looking at the room the door on the opposite side is definitely the door that leads into the divan castle's worm it has this the circular camera on it and with the the angle of the light it would go right into there and go straight through into the next room you said there's another aperture this one is yes we don't have any more reflectors I I start like moving things on that like I walk back into the room mm-hmm cautiously and I start like moving things on the tables I'm looking for like some sort of large reflective surface of some sort make an investigation check yeah start flipping tables and stuff then I'm still trying to push the statue I'm not restring yeah I got a ten you go to one of the bodies of the models and there is a ring of keys on his belt I very hesitantly because it's another dead body in this room and I'm really scared I throw holy water on it as you reach for the keys and I'm like might be with you might be with you might be with you this is so much like ouch yeah let's make them yeah it didn't move okay all right the only other thing that you can see in this room looking around there are stacks of archive books and many cabinets there are two sets of cabinets both of which bear on the outside there the seals of the Vaughan castles and the the heraldry of Drakon Heim and in a pile of amongst all those scrap is a very strange object there is a large metallic sphere on the ground it is about 1 foot in diameter and is made out of what looks like a filigreed mithril and it itself has extending off of it these two long spindly arms and on one side of the sphere is a large telescope like like a eyeball on the center on on this Vall and on the bottom of it there is this long slot from which a sheet of shiny paper is trailing out does it have any resemblance to the machines in the clock tower the Madras memo Jones it is definitely some kind of machine but about the construction of it and the fillery on it are almost celestial in nature and in fact it has engraving the Celestia of celestial tones on it I read them what do I remember from my the glory days make make your juveniles in the plains our religion I have obly know my I don't have any I don't have a person's thick any like training in religion but you speak celestial yeah I know Celeste show you learned the language but you didn't study their history classic just just ignorant of their culture just really just wanted some passing words yeah like I wanted to say hi bye you know thank you for like chat with angels but not care about yeah it's it's sprawled out on the ground in in McClay ER of dust on it we can we put it in the back of the whole thing I go up and I like kind of push it and just step back as you push it it shakes and it begins to work and then it sounds like there's a chiming coming from inside of it and it suddenly shakes and shutters and being so float in the air and I come to the residue the telescoping buy begins to retract and contract and it very suddenly starts to fly and it turns and faces at each of you and it says in celestial but you to understand it no oh hello and as it speaks its voice is almost like singing my name is Sebastian Crowe who are you go into the room it says I am you can't what is your purpose here I have lived here for a very long time but I have been sleeping for years things have changed here I can see we've been hired to do some renovations we're gonna bring this place back up to health code help the health code standards yeah yep can you help I don't know I have been sent here to serve the flame keepers and assist them with keeping their records do you know anything about that a pattern and point towards the small alcove yes yeah that is where the monks keep a great weapon called the flame time what what is it it is a great blade that they stored here little you like blades I love blades how do we open it you must guide the light towards it that is all I know do you know where they keep other reflect do devices around here is there one here in this room no there is not but if you need reflectors there are many shields with it okay I believe that there is another set of shields kept under the guard of some of the old flame keepers and priests since we're gonna have to go yes out from the east can I ask what was the last record you remember keeping I take a very special kind of record I am NOT allowed to remember very far for to do for I give of my memories when I record them but I can show you what I can do if you would like yep and I just give like a thumbs up certainly with the three of you stand together for a moment Jack and hug the creature floats up and floats a few feet away and it's glass like AI begins to zoom in and out and as it does so it's two two arms spread out and beams of light and met from its hands over the page of paper coming out of it and it creates the most realistic painting you have ever seen it is this glassy realistic image that almost looks like you were it was like it almost looks real it doesn't look like it's paint it looks like it's literally been painted with pure light and it tears it off and it hands it to you sooner it looks terrified can we do this again yeah can we can we do one more is it of us yeah it's it's a it's a it's the three of us looking horrifying can we do one more yes certainly and it does one more and it the light shines from its hands on the page it rips it off and it hands it to you much better thank you you can hang this up in our clock tower looking at its trail of like paper there other images yes I have been making images for some time here I don't remember them I make them in like for them anymore um do you do you remember names now thanks to the cupboard the keys might open the cupboards to the it has been at least 15 years since I have made an image like this where was the last image you made I don't remember those cupboards that you had mentioned are they locked they they are I start trying keys recovered and you open whatever cupboards up and it is filled with filled with more of these images I start to take the images out I start going through them furiously I hand a pile to Pluto and shove one towards him I hand you a stack and we saw stir we're looking for heirs to the jack geun-hye R it looks like there are images of there's one image that you come to you and it was taken at the great city courts and it there's a there's a picture that has the king the steward the Lord Commander the high flame keeper it's an image of all of the the ruling council of Drakon honey that is how your dad I just take it and I just start like you here / in my throat like the most satisfied and I just say all look very stoic it looks very very official yeah and the the image is all over them kind of all with like their arms crossed my all look like very serious men and women no I'll pose like very very formally and as you go through a few there's most of these are very official looking images and as the Archon speaks I can only make these images a few times each day so there are not many of them do they have dates on them yeah it's someone who's written on the back of them of the dates what does this one say of my dad this one was taken about 20 years ago I start looking at the dates specifically trying to find any image that was taken ya months before they're arranged chronologically and it seems like the council would take an image like this every year so there's images of the count the King's Council that are in that are here each year there's images of the clergy the guild masters would all get together of all the various skills of tracking time and there's like one giant image of them all taken in the in the Cathedral all the images have been taken in the cathedral itself I was gonna say I like take my sleeve and I rubbed my eye and I'm like I'm not crying you're crying this is my dad guys it's my dad I'm not crying mm-hmm either right okay there's another folder that seems to contain other images in it of the royal family that are less formal in nature and there are photos of tabloids the royal family when at the birth of each of the children and going through some of these photos like many of them are framed in wood and capped all all in here in preserve and preserved and going through them there is there is a photo of the steward holding a very small veil and there's this the steward and he's standing with another man and little veo together in this photo is a family oh my gosh this is this is amazing what's like these these could give us so much information like who do you know that other man yeah he was he was always with my dad used together with my dad his name was Ehrich he might maybe if we can find Eric we can find your dad gives us something else to work on yeah I don't know where he was the day of the the meteor crash I was with my dad and we got separated I don't know where Eric was do you remember what he did like was he a steward as well there was the guard I know he was he was always around with us he was part of my family was Johan and Eric my family and I don't know I I must have oh my gosh I forgot about him I have to find him - I have to find Eric but could he be with my dad I don't know I I stare at the photograph I think I want to keep looking for maybe Sebastian's mom I'm also looking for the last photo ever taken and how close to the meteor crash that was I like that you're look there yeah so you're gonna ask some of the photos that are a hundred years old they go back about a hundred and fifty years and there are several photos and then the council that have lent a Theban died in them did he find one found your mom when's the date cuz if we didn't find the last one that she was in the council yeah I used to be a member of the counts and I could tell us maybe more about why she quit which is running from maybe there's other people in the photo singham a thousand words the last the last images of Lenin in in there go back about a hundred years ago 102 years ago 102 years ago that tells us something let's keep that photo in the last photo that I fall she was in and put it in my because they Kenny buddy in that photo too could be important yeah incidentally all the people in those photos are all bearing their various seals but is she the only mouth amongst the council yeah so everybody else is probably yeah probably dead but it could also tell us if they're all wearing seals we can know what the seals look like too sure what's the last photo the council photos continue right up until it seems like they did this every summer they took these photos and they go go right up right up to and there's photos basically of all and they're very archival in nature there's only a handful of images that are kind of not formal like this but the the last image being one of the council itself and [Music] that's all it is I think we should also take some candid photos of the heirs of Dragan home yeah because we don't we were carrying around like a painting we found this would be more accurate for sure yeah so but isn't it when they were born or there's later it's only birth photos there's no of them as young kids okay I start to gather all the photos that I can see of my dad and I just start to like put them in my bag I'm looking for any is there any other archival documents like theirs I did you see there's two cabinets there there are several cabinets there's lots of documents here that basically talk about records of the city and records of the flame keepers there are one of the cabinets has a bunch of marriage certificates for various noble families in them others have deeds and titles but aside from the photos of the royal family that are here there's nothing pertaining to the royal family specifically most of this mostly other information here is about other families in the city yeah several other noble families have their images taken here but no like a royal family you know marriage certificates you know I think next thing on our list down here is to find two more shields as if we're gonna get into the Von castles chamber we need two shields to reflect the light so like well we need a shield to get into this this room this guy can reflect the light right through that opportunity room we need to deflect it again and we also need one on the other side exactly so we need at least two you're absolutely got one on the other side off Oh true so we need two more shields in order to get that door open I bet you're in there on the scary other side yeah so I think it's like we said before we said south and then we went north and then we went back around here yeah it's time to go to the other side in south and go south because we need to hunt for some more shields so to the mouth south to the mouth of danger on the other side and then we can get you a new sword hmm that might be nice called flame tongue question should we leave the machine the light machine here I think we should take oh can you come yeah can you you leave the room you want to come with us I am bound to the cathedral that's fine do you want to come upstairs with us sure there's going to be some new archival footage as we consecrate this land I only do still have to sweeten the pot to get you to do like a video archive or three capital bucks no there's a huge technological leap forward required to make a massive difference between photography and video you can do like a stop-motion can we do it like a stub you know what well he's going to an event film right now is that what's happening it's Pluto Jackson industry you know you're gonna have to come up with the Maltese Cross you're gonna have so many mechanical things that need to be done in order to capture film yeah I got so many other things on my list like added to the list invent film [Music] [Laughter] robot painter man what was your name Luke aunt Lou cons I'd like to introduce you to the bag of holding no yes the bag of holding and I open it out no we're gonna make you a surprise just come upstairs and well I'm gonna introduce you to a philia she is a flame keeper bringing lecompt upstairs a philia is shocked and she says this being is a celestial he it is an angel known as a camera Archon that's so cool weird name I like it we used all the pictures today on a house I'm so sorry and we found your amazing photos they're just remarkable beings we a few of them are summoned and they teach us they paint through light they call what they do photography and love it the images that they create are very sacred it's pretty awesome they made this beautiful painting of the three of us from this that's good here's the good one the they're mysterious beings and they they save very little but there are many orders of scott of our sages and acolytes that have studied them for generations trying to learn the secrets of what they do it is miraculous the way that they can put these images on a page what's more miraculous is that nobody mentioned to us how elaborate the pathways down there were turns out you need to guide light through the hallways and I guess you can't bring your own from here so you didn't know that are all cathedrals built like this it depends on many of many cathedrals all throughout we are custodians of sacred knowledge and oftentimes particularly in Westham are I know that the folk here worked very closely with the King to guard and guide secrets of course if there are defenses down here they are here to protect it in the event that the place would fall then to stop the thief usually from getting in there not really if they're giving you a hard time I'm very sorry that's nothing part of the reason why in sight both Illyria and Westham are let our cathedrals use guard these things because well the only other group of people with the the means to use magic to protect secrets are the amethyst Academy and well there's a lot of good reasons not to give the amethyst Academy state secrets true no that's fair that's fair well I'd like to say that we found everything that we were looking for but we're we're not we're not quite there yet there's a few doors blocking our path where we found so much more though we're gonna we're gonna be down there for a little bit longer well we will have to see what happens next week look at that plural dad's true yeah yeah my dad's we never you never mentioned Eric yeah he well he and my dad that's around towards the end yeah wasn't quite there you know when the meteor fell but he was still around dragon hive and I guess I should have been more thoughtful about looking well it seems like it kind of like the photo kind of sparked like you know when you have those things where you're like oh I totally like you brought like back some memories and yeah that's good this is good you're assuming based on an old photo that Eric is also alive you're so I mean you you are a baby in that photo that's true yeah you never know you never know anything could have happened yeah we shall see times yeah that's where we're gonna wrap things up for tonight a big thank you to our cast as
