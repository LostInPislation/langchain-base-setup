Eastern time at which TV slash dungeon underscore dudes you can also watch the video episodes of the show on YouTube this evenings episode of dungeons of dragon haim has been sponsored by our very good friends at 1985 games who have just launched their new dungeon craft Kickstarter they are now fully funded and on their way to their stretch goals and they sent us a preview copy of the full book that has all of the really awesome 2d terrain pieces that you cut out and use in your game and I cannot wait actually to slice some of these up and use them for when I go to game stores or conventions to run some games because I think that it's very portable and lightweight love the 3d terrain stuff but this is super portable and affordable it's only 30 bucks if you get in on the Kickstarter and they have tie-ins for ghosts of saltmarsh and the new upcoming baldur's gate descent into a furnace or with terrain that's appropriate for those adventures so check them out by following the links below or nineteen eighty-five games dungeon craft on Kickstarter with that let's return to the ruins [Music] director dimers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed wolf believed the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder and the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon Heinrich caught amidst rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Dragon I'm when last we left our heroes they were exploring the depths of the catacombs beneath the grand Cathedral of Saint vitru via the largest and oldest temple and Church to the sacred fire in the city of Drac and I'm having reclaimed it from the Noles led by the Lord of the feast now the silver order and the flame keepers of the sacred fire await our heroes to return who have been sent down below to retrieve the bones of the legendary Saint but Rubio and his draconic mount so that they may be used to reignite the altar of the sacred fire at the heart of the cathedral itself once done the silver order maintains that this will create a protective ward at the center of the city of Dragon hime a new launching point for reclaiming the rest of the city at large but of course our heroes have had a difficult journey thus far cut off from the sacred energies of the sacred fire the Restless dead beneath the grand Cathedral have harried our hero's progress at every turn and it seems like the vaults below might carry a few more secrets than the party anticipated but we have a baboon so I'm not even worried anymore named chimpanzee yeah they've been pretty interesting so far you know almost dying inside so let's just tally up what we found in here so far we need to find a way to get to the flame tongue we need to find a way to get into the von Castle vault yeah and we need to find the bones in order to do all of those we need more shields yes we need two more two more shields am I missing anything we have a lot more grave robbing ahead of us and to do that I'm always for graver like we're gonna have to fill our stomachs in our pockets stomachs I'm also like I might need to slam some aqua delirium you should read and delicious oh you go delirium cuz I am running super low makes yeah it makes me feel good it's like I don't know man it's like an energy drink but for magic the purple glowing vials ring with power in your pack will you knock one back yeah when in Drakon time and I knock one back alrighty rola d3 I mean like what's the worst do 3 D 3 it's D 3.1 yep so that's two so you rolled a 3 so that is three levels worth of spells so one third level spell three first level spells or second and first as you knock back the potion you see whenever Sebastian drinks one of these potions you can see the purple energy going down his throat and coursing through his veins like it almost looks like the veins and this throat and his neck almost bulged out slightly as the liquid goes down his throat into it into his stomach and this power for a brief moment it's like his entire nervous system is phosphorescent and bioluminescent it glows with this purple light for just a flash of a few seconds after drinking aqua delirium I I finish it and I burp and I'm like a purple cloud just kind of flows there it looks like the hazel yeah it drifts away and yeah it morphs into a screaming mouth that means it works well I feel a little bit better I can yeah I can keep going okay okay how are you guys feeling oh I'm alright yeah you are fine you look like you are in perfect health he's enjoying that yeah I'm 5g I'm still feeling a little bit green from scream green dead buffs of white fur across Bao's body after her early encounter with that twisted monk below yeah was that one of your life do two packs II have nine lives I've heard rumors it's like one and a half yeah a lot lot in one go but you know what I'm recovered I'm good I'm ready to shoot something in the face not any of us no no okay so get some shields get you a sword yeah get into we want to get in we're not in the same room it's like the the priests and all that we're hanging out at separate from them right now you are in the lower catacombs at the first staircase down where the statue of the Ark Angel Gabriela holds out her spear and shield and that you've moved the the positions of her hands such that the light from her shield as it reflects down from above has opened up the doorway leading into where the vaughn castle vault is you haven't reflected it further from there mm-hmm and so that room is illuminated showing off the large guardians protecting either side of the vault and we've opened the other side as well correct we've done all of you yeah the doorway that leads from the scriptorium into the van kessel vault that is one of those large doors that has the aperture lend that is sensitive to the light you actually have not opened that earlier down the hallway was a font of holy water in which the the morning angel was the tears from the morning angel were coming down to fill that with holy water and that angel has its hands positioned to hold a shield but you haven't put one there and position yet to shine light into their that has not we have that shield we have originally but then we've removed it again that's correct yeah oh sorry baboon is carrying that shield yeah chimpanzee gluto I gotta ask you a question if I'm remembering correctly the cathedral was somewhere that you really wanted to come for a while now like since you arrived in Drakon oh yeah there's some important documents yeah do you think that they're in the Vaughan Castle vault they're either in the van kessel vault or they could be with the bones so either way we should explore that Vaughn Castle vault is a code yeah there's a and and I'm also like I like secrets behind that door you know what I am with you on that vo do you like secrets do you like uncovering truths I don't but I'm in happy to help you in your pursuit of Secrets you know it's piqued my curiosity and if it falls in line with your goals and I'm a hundred percent I really do need to get in there and we need the next shield anyways to unlock the other but we need this other shield and it just happens to open these these doors so when I hear something called flame tongue I just we got to have it whatever it is whatever it is we got to have it whatever the cost whatever the cuts my friends for this I will never sacrifice my friends unless a demon asks I will only enough now Pluto a question you've been wanting to come here for this whole time has it lived up to your expectations you know what I pictured a lot less Undead I thought it was just gonna be like a library and I was just gonna go through and I was gonna be like excuse me ma'am and she was yeah you go hey new here visiting from caspia do you have any marriage certificates yours aisle five they don't have the Dewey Decimal System here and then so I go down and I go to il5 and I looked I scratch and she was called notes up here I go thank you she's very helpful not many people are in the crypt and then I get it and I walk out this is yeah this has been a nightmare so like the opposite of a horrible nightmare okay skeletons coming to life I mean you dying in front of me welcome to Dragon him yeah I mentioned that I don't like undead and I mean this this lives up to that I continue to not like undead there they they scare me not many things scare me but I don't think I may have said this before but the the thing I hate about undead is that I have to kill them twice and that's frustrating the thing that I hear is you're supposed to die pissed I killed you have your children toys just to die twice as much energy for the same in my net like most things just die so the doors of the vault Bowl are closed the way is shut as they say what will you do we're going we're gonna go the other way now so south for the mouth the mouth okay and we're gonna turn I turn the shield around so that it points at the south door so the south door does not have an aperture lens on it we might need to light the the only thing that strikes you immediately as you head down here is that the once again down this hall are the catacomb like niches of the previous of hallways adorned with funerary urns and skulls although interestingly enough all of the skulls that have been placed along here have semi-precious stones or coins placed in their eyes we can get them on the way out the effects as you shine the light down the hallway is that the light takes on a rainbow hue for the gemstones and coins in the eyes reflect off the light sending a prismatic shower of light that dances all down the hallway all right guys huddle up huddle up first of all we aren't gonna use the drift globe agreed I can't understand why second of all should we take some gems or does that seem like an equally bad idea for now equally back on our way out if something happens to not like us stealing the gems then we're on our way out anyways not true see I could go either way cuz the gems could be like rustle them up but also at the same time what if the gems spread the light in a way that doesn't allow us to focus it later okay let's combine those two thoughts we don't disrupt the gems if we get to a puzzle keep in mind the idea of splitting the light using gems to solve a puzzle that is just I'm gonna add that into my notes here noted edited a list and now we have that okay very cool who wants to open that door I got it alright this door pushes its way open and a brilliant light is in the center of this room remarkably a large brazier of fire still burns in this room and you can smell this slight this very slight sort of pungent smell in this room as the flames burn and almost continuing to sputter but they they sputter and intermittently and you can almost hear this small hissing noise coming from the font and the you see that the brazier itself though the flame burns there is no fuel there's no oil there's no wood or anything in the fire itself the rest of this room is semi circular in shape on this room are four sets of niches all covered with stacks of skulls and aa Suri's bearing the same skulls with set filled with semi-precious stones and with their eyes and in some pieces their teeth have been replaced by semi-precious stones or coins and some of the skulls even have their mouths open and have like a core they're biting down on a coin but then there are two sets of shelves here that are filled with statues made of jade ivory obsidian and several had the helmet like headdresses that have been worn by former flame keepers the there's what looks like the skull of a Manticore the skull of a wyvern a few blade hilts as well as bits of the ends of maces or blade hilts have been arranged on these shelves in a decorative fashion including one several figurines of various birds that are carved out of various metal so there's one bird made of gold one bird made of platinum one bird made of silver one bird made of ivory one bird made of obsidian and one bird carved of wood and then all of them in the shelf below it are another set of monsters all carved in alternating versions of these various materials lining all the shelves up and down then the rows of skulls opposite the circular part of the room are too large portcullises behind which are massive sarcophagi and as you look around the room you can see that borne atop each sarcophagi is a massive golden shield golden shield well those are probably the shield's we need and opposite you is a large stone door filled in the center with another aperture lens does the light hit it or does it hit the floor the light hits the floor you would need to bounce the light to hit the aperture lens at the opposite end of the room before we place any shields I think we should just check this room out because we're going to need those two shields as well do you think we need both yeah we need three shields to complete some of the former puzzles so I walk into the room yes we do sorry that took me a while they do the math and I'm gonna walk up to the flame and I kind of reach my hand out it's hot it's hot it is hot and you can hear this hissing noise at the base of the basin is an open hole and the flame is like originating the the air kind of ripples underneath the flame as this hissing comes up from the hole and then the flame just ignites in place in place there you can see that the there it looks like there are bits of flint and steel set into the sides on kind of a spring like there's it's built onto the side of the brazier on the lip of it that you could kind of push this and caused a spark and where you see that mechanism you can see that cast into the metal at the top of the brazier there is an inscription written in celestial Pluto can you read this for me that doesn't help what does it say it says I used my breed skill the bodies of our first flame keepers rest here under the watchful gaze of the dead air a living soul should seek their guiding light no only those who see with clear eyes can find the way then you may have truth on silver wings it's another riddle you eat at nine more times and the answer you're all worried about all the combat encounters but no [Laughter] reanimating skeletons scary golems or death gaze empower dead monks the riddle the bodies of the high flame keepers of the past rest here under the watchful gaze of the dead air a living soul should seek their guiding light no only that those who see with clear eyes can find the way then you may have the truth on silver wings so the first half of that is all about yes we want these guys they're our friends but the first half is just saying here's the flame keepers they're holding shields if you're alive and you want those shields you need to see with clear eyes and something about silver wings there's a silver bird over there right there is indeed there is a figurine of a silver bird on the shelf we got a silver bird what is clear eyes mean what about that you said there are some with gems in their eyes correct I want around the room looking for the skulls that might have like clear gems diamonds diamonds or something or if there's one skull that has no gems oh yeah looking through you find takes you a little while but indeed there are several skulls here that have various types of gemstones set in them and looking at them closely you realize that they appear to be semi-precious stones but they might actually just be like clear quartz or glass mm-hmm that has been colored but one of the skulls on the wall does not have any gems in it sighs can I wear it like a helmet big enough is it a human skull it is a human skull is your skull really tiny yeah it rests on one of the lower parts of the wall its mouth shut where's it looking if I look the exact it has no eyes facing sorry yeah good good good wording yeah which way is it facing its facing out into all the skulls are facing towards the flame at the center of the room can I just do a quick like if I spend some time kind of examining how this fire is coming into into existence can I can I learn anything about it it's me yeah I make an investigation check 12:00 there is all you can surmise is there is some kind of there must be some kind of gas coming up from the hole in the center of this that is feeding this flame so where's the source and you guys read me the riddle one more time the bodies of the high flame keepers rest here under the watchful gaze of the dead air a living soul seek their guiding light no only those who see with clear eyes can find the way then you may have truth on silver wings I walk up to the skull that has nothing and I reach out for it and I stop and I turn to FeO is this a good idea in your own words what's the worst like it happened I grab the skull and remove it you grab the skull and as you go to pull it out make a perception check perceive it 20 you pull it and it's actually stuck into the wall but as you go to pull you put your finger through one of its eye sockets and you can feel that there is a latch inside it's eye socket I want to go grab the silver bird and like have it ready okay because I'm not really sure what else is going on here you go to grab the silver bird and as you pick it up there is a latch underneath it there's a latch here guys all right do we do like one two three latch so can what do we open them one it can you can you do the latch in the in the because I think it's in order the bird a second in the griddle so I'm gonna I'm gonna flip mine first ears right Plutus i position the baboon with the shield in front of me against the brazier so I'm protected go I flipped the latch in the skull as you flip the latch in the skull there is a shuddering sound and a rattling of metal coming from the portcullis George look the bird I don't know and they rattle and the two portcullises rise we wanted this right is this what we wanted I guess we can show the board I just solve a puzzle did we win well I feel good about this wait were these even people that we needed bones of no we need the shield I love my shields are in there nevermind here's what I'm worried about though I never never trust a corpse okay so all my years of being a sorcerer I've learned one thing let's say you never trust a corpse I agree show the chimpanzees caring and I go chimpanzee go retrieve the shield the chimpanzee goes and retrieves one of the shields and brings it back to you good boy I had a dragon on a double major and this other one double major and my mind's already out and I'm like it's invisible I can't are you ready it's going Oh three two one go it's like wobbling cuz we can't cord me yeah probably just maybe I'm busy as you it does wobble with the two mage hands as you pull it out so the but you managed to bring it back towards you and you have three large shields and though they are golden on the tops the insides are filled with the reflectors of the other shields are there named nametags essentially to tell us who these two people are yes these were the original grande flame keepers of track and I'm the the very first ones that founded this Cathedral after and they were / they you can see on their inscriptions that it says that they were friends of Saint but Rubio and named this in his honor and I have their names written down right here do we do we open that just to see that I want to see a body did you not to see plenty of bodies so many bodies flame keepers elarekt and flame keepers Sorel mmm okay we should close the thing so that way they don't come out at all yeah we have the shields sorry Pluto I click the bird back I click the skull back close that do they close yep need more undead than what we want so and you said there was a stone door at the end yes there is another stone door with the aperture opposite here as well so well you want to go through this door no oh no no why not I think the bones might be passed there and I think we should go back and open the youth on Castle door first we have all three shields we have the shields we have the technology okay yeah we can do the vault first and then and then the bones just because once we get the bones then we can go well I have a theory that retrieving the bones of st. for true vo might wake up a whole bunch of undead that's a theory I have nothing to prove this until we try it all so once we get the bones we want to leave and I'm assuming we'll want to leave quickly the Vaughn Castle vault is something that we want to do before we leave that's my theory that's my running idea I like it also um we could go try to get that thing that the monks were protecting the flame tone the same time we can do that now yeah which do you want I mean we should go set set it up in the other womb anyways right yeah we should do this and while we're here yeah let's go back around all right we have a plan so we wobble the shields over I turn the we we leave the room okay go back a 3G with three three shields close the door we close the door behind us okay and we turn the statue to point at the aperture the other way to the vaughn castle okay then what are you going to do place the first shield or do they need to be done at the same time yeah we need to shine on the thing so let's go upstairs and go to the other room okay the shield in in that the fountain okay tears when we make our way back to the fountain okay any problems with that no you make your way back to the fountain and the shield is in place there and we turn the statue to go through that room that the monk was in and hit the aperture on the other door so who's gonna turn the statue I'm not strong I'll do it now wait do we need to aim it at the thing first or do you want to stand in the room and do the do the reflection into the to get the sword into the into the other thing you want you want to open the flame tongue room first yeah I'll do that sure yeah you want me to go into that room I can go into that room if you guys can turn it we can probably turn together okay so I'm gonna hold in okay no yeah baboon chimpanzees gonna stand and I kind of like help them okay like because I use his shoulders I do the shoulder grab and I kind of like to turn them until he's perfect and then I run out of the room and so you're gonna have the chimpanzee stand in the scriptorium holding one of the shields to point it at the flame tongue aperture okay and then put the one of the their shields in the statue in the statue and turn the statute appointed chimpanzee Babu okay so with that the beam of light reaches out from Michael towards bounces off the morning angel and bounces off the shield held by the chimpanzee in towards the stone aperture these stones vanish into glittering lights revealing a hallway that returns back towards a circular chamber where there is another brazier of flame held in place and you can see that there is something glimmering within the flames Pluto wait here baboon grab it widow do you want help getting that thing yeah okay I'm gonna walk into the room I walk in with them okay veil I'm like maybe outside I think I should okay I'll watch my Boone to make sure I supervise I'll sit just in case like if this wall goes down we need to get out my sister this chamber that you stand in now is directly beneath the altar of the sacred fire above and you can see in this room there is a brave a smaller brazier underneath of flame and it flickers almost like is the light that is meant to start something for all around it you can see leading up into the altar underneath in this circular chamber there are all these manner of tubes of metal that all lead up from the ground up onto the circular dome and collect in one place underneath where the altar would be above in the room above and surrounding this room on each of these metallic columns that are on the walls you can see that there are circular there are wheels that have been placed on each and in some places there are latches as well and there are these very strange metallic protrusions that have this strange white painted mark with a needle on them where you can see they're painted these celestial runes over a feel over what looks like a Halfmoon part of it painted in red part of it in yellow part and orange and part and green and all of these strange clocks are beside the wheels and the needles on them are just gently rocking back and forth in in this room all surrounding of course all of these are more of these skulls and niches all around it but in this case all of the skulls have their mouths open and coming out from their mouths are these look like these long black tongues of stone that end in a nozzle and then there's the small staircase that goes up to the flaming brazier at the center where there is the this flickering flame and floating above it is a blade I don't feel comfortable with this room this this this room scares me how far from the entrance to the brazier the room is roughly 40 feet in diameter and the hallway the hallway is only about 40 feet long itself leading back yep what do you guys see I think I can make hand it from where I am I'm like I've walked down the hallway and I'm at the edge of the room mm-hmm but I think it's gonna weigh more than I think I can grab it but I I have an idea what's your idea well I want to approach the brazier well I'm staying back here man and I'm gonna either the clocks with the little kneels and so right now they're kind of following the same motions right yeah I look back at them can I reach the blade it is wreathed in flame do you need a mage hand I have a hand that might not get hurt by flares my monkey it's hot it's warm you got a dress why are you reaching into the fire I reach into the fire it burns Wow you take five points of fire damage are you going to continue yes yes okay he owe me your hand is rate around the hill the grip and hilt of the blade how are you going to reach and take it yes I could literally chillip for you your hands are on the blade you take another five points of fire damage as your grip closes around the blade you hear a voice echo out in your mind who takes up ignatius the flame tongue hey it's me Pluto I'm a prince of caspia and I am the the next owner of this blade I answer to no king or nation and will be wielded by none except he who fights in the glory of the flame oh did I not mention that I fight take another five points can you move the blade I want to try to pull it nikka strength Jacky go this is my blade just strength yep 23 you rip the blade out of the fire and in that moment a jet of flame reaches out from the skulls of each of surrounding this room as a chorus answers you taking taking the blade and the voices say ignatius follows those who fight with faith you have chosen to show only your might prove that you are worthy to take up the flames Tong and as the blade pulls out a from the flame as you pull the brazier forth the the flame coalesces into a burning shape and you and you watch as these flames wreath over Pluto and pull and it almost looks like the armor his armor is melting and falling apart but as it does so this flaming form pushes its way out off of Pluto and forms into this fiery avatar in the shape of pollute Oh with its own hand on the blade itself and it pulls away and a copy of the blade appears in its hand its hand and it lower it closes pollute OHS helmet and points the blade out in in in front of you roll for initiative I don't know Mike I only know Mike you know what Ignatius I think we got off on the wrong boy my name is the faithful Pluto Jackson from that faith-based community in a place that you're pretty familiar with and faith and stuff do we have a setup for that room or I yep I mean II just scramble this whole time that that was happening me and Vale are just behind you like I was I was getting ready to run in and tackle you off of it and then you split into fire you and normal you and I kind of stopped I was like just getting ready I'm like I'm going in oh oh man oh no I'm not going in and I'm way down the hall like I'm sure I can't the door opened keep the door open okay I mean baboon I mean baboon can keep the door open his name is Tim Benji his name is chimpanzee dramatically expect nothing less than dramatic yeah yeah I also have this feeling that this is like for lack of a better word this sword might be like the the igniter it might be the spark plug for this Cathedral so we gotta finish this 23:23 for bayo four four four Sebastian and fourteen okay so Vale you are first to act and you see down the hallway this this fiery pollute Oh Take Shape holding the blade I say Pluto I'm gonna shoot the fire you but I'll keep the door open so I'm it was 40 feet in the room and then how long was the hallway again is 30 30 yeah okay cool and I start you know what I'm gonna use magical arrows though for this these three shots to see to see what happens so I'm gonna take my dread ambusher and I'm going to take a shot with magic oh no eight to hit the arrow is consumed in the flames of fiery Pluto's body oops even worse 1313 all of the arrows deflect off of the molten plate armor worn by the form of Ignatius he's strong he's and as they and as they do so as the arrows deflect off of them they oh I need you to make a charisma saving groan gosh okay eleven okay as you fire the arrows you feel almost heartburn strikes you and this wreath of flame begins to form around you and around your own weapon almost like the same thing that's happening to Pluto is about to happen to you as as well as if like this essence of your own the essence of your own body is trying to pull itself out in rejection for the active for acting against Ignatius oh no I saw my movement though right yeah how far away's though the the holy font the holy font is about 60 feet away my feline agility and I like run and I like dive into the holy [ __ ] yep okay Ignatius Ignatius takes up his himself in the wearing the body of this fiery pollute oh and brings the sword down towards him as he does so the flames push out from him in an ignition of flame and he gets a 13 and a 13 and a 22 to hit 22 hits the 22 hits the fiery blade cuts into you Pluto for eight points of slashing damage and seven points of fire damage whoa ooh baby I'm hot Pluto your turn so one thing I want to do is I want to use my reaction now am I am i wielding this sword now yes oh oh baby and it is hot it is effectively under the effects of the heat metal spell Oh mmm can I swing Adam with it you absolutely can but you do need to make a constitution saving throw okay I do that I get a 17 you succeed and so I just need to double-check the rules for heat metal I think you don't take the damage or note so do you want to drop the object or not no okay so you a distance of the heat of the the object you succeeded in let you succeeded you're saving throat so in this case because it's not exactly heat metal you it's not doing any damage to you currently it's just burning hot you don't drop it you're holding on to it you don't a disadvantage on the attack girls look oh wow yeah and first I want to swing at him for missing me okay I want to repost him and I get a 19 so that is a hit and what do I roll for the damage it is a long sort and unfortunately he himself is immune to fire damage so you don't get to roll the extra 2d6 fire okay except he takes a 16 damage okay and then it's on your turns proper sorry twenty-one damage pardon me twenty-one Wow because it was the repost right in then I'm gonna start swinging at him oh boy oh boy get him 21 to hit that's a hit for nine damage okay and I want to use a superiority dice and do a distracting strike nice on him and he takes another six damage and then I'll swing again for my second attack and I get also close like a 27 to hit yeah that hits for 13 damage okay and then I want to use my second wind to heal because look I've been burning from fire as Sebastian it is your turn and I go I've never hit someone that looks so good I might say that to him because it's important that he knows he's a good-looking cat I guess you could say that he's even hotter than you I don't have many options here Sebastian comes forward just a little bit and pulls out his wand and reaches out his hand and cast chill touch and a skeletal hand appears on Ignatius and we're gonna see if that works I get a 19-2 hit that is a hit nice job so the skeletal hand chokes them for eight damage oh you also get advantage on that hit attack which means you should roll two more dice because of elven accuracy to see if you get it just see the other crit nope they were both horrible wah-wah-wah and then I fall into this little alcove here and I yell blue you got this as the gel hand touches ignatius the flame resounds through its spectral form and a flutter of a moment as the rest of its body begins to form almost in the shape of a skeletal yet fiery Sebastian make a charisma saving throw Oh 18 you see it and it makes brief eye contact with you before fluttering out that was weird it is your turn so I've jumped in the holy water okay is it still a flame veo coming after me it's as you leap into the holy water these flames dissipate off of you and you are now a very wet cat now my favorite thing but if it helps me not be on fire or have flames come at me I'm cool with it so I am going to in fact you feel very calm like it has soothed the way the heart burn as well heartburn is the worst I get it sometimes when I eat certain sue it's like you know Knowles it's the real hearts like gamey meat gives me heartburn i bonus action - back to the door so I can see down and then I take two shots at Ignatius okay 22 do it that is a hit here we go 23 damage Wow do you get sneak attack no I didn't have advantage it doesn't matter cuz Pluto's within five feet oh because six damage on top 14 to hit the first hit sends a crack through the molten armor of ignatius but the second hit does not penetrate he is effectively bloodied though you are doused in holy water this it almost is starting to boil off and there's steam coming off the surface of your fur and body make a charisma saving throw with advantage 13 okay it continues to steam away and all of a sudden you're dry but as it dries off you feel whatever flaming spirit is taking your heart as well but for the moment heartburn really lay on a ship late-night snacks rages out and and slices in to pollute Oh once again yes getting a 12 and a 19 to hit misses and 20 to hit 20 heads that will be 11 points of slashing damage ow and can I repost again yep and when do I make my Conn save for the start of your turn cut wha-bam I get a 22 for 9 damage all right yak pollute oh it is your turn and then I say I hope you have the faith Ignatius and I spray my holy water at him I take my waters gonna read I spray okay make an attack roll with advantage and show you anything to it ad while consider a thrown weapon attack so like like like I would throw yeah like you throw a javelin base um 2424 okay the in vial smashes against Ignatius is form and he is particularly vulnerable to this Cyril 8d 6 yeah I have the faith do you do anymore 1 2 3 4 5 I need two more got it one more I got one okay here comes this is the big one count them maths that's a lot of ones into 2022 that's enough with a flash of steam the the molten remains of ignatius collapsed to the ground and then the metal immediately rusts and flakes away as this fiery copy is obliterated utterly and completely the blade is still warm to the touch but not as burning hot as it once was and you hear this voice in your mind say your Tamra burns hot and your might is like that of a volcano maybe there is steel that can be shaped into your heart yet into an instrument of faith the true vo in his youth was much like you I will fight alongside you and perhaps you can be shown the light yet if you accept this truth then I will fight with you betray it and I will strike you down I accept okay very well Pluto Jackson no truth shall be hidden from me or you while we walk the world together let us fight on for the light for the light also just like a side thing you kind of speak in riddles - what does this mean with the truth and stuff so Ignatius is a flame tongue that bears a +2 bonus as well - attack and damage rolls however here we go Ignatius permanently emanates a zone of truth that's like our weakness it is a radius of 10 feet and furthermore well you wield Ignatius you gain a flaw in that you cannot abide lies and deceptions I do not tolerate I do not tolerate the lies and the deceptions who do I think it's time for us stay 10 feet away from you at all times please I run into the room and I start spraying my water skin on the ashes on the ground and I'm like I got him I got him Pluto oh I emptied my whole load that's a neat sword you should go get more holy water because if this is vegetation I think it's really cool I think you look really good with it why did I say that furthermore you are bound to ignatius now yeah we're buds can you hold that sword up again you look so strong man that's good I fight for truth why I don't even know I lie so much why is this I like back up a bit I need help I don't know what's happening I'm so on the hallway did we get up is he dead I think we won okay good what are the dial that the clocks doing they flared up for a moment but now they have their still and the flame in the center here is out oh it's out oh that can't be good I mean it may not be bad do you have a new sword it's pretty cool yeah but also this is like if this is the thing that starts the flame upstairs I feel way more comfortable standing at 10 feet away from you so here here's how Ignatius is technically a curse weapon Pluto I'll send you all the details but basically well Ignatius is drawn the blade emanates a zone of truth put that thing away and well you have the blade on your possession you have the flaw that you cannot abide lies and deceptions and when you hear them you will be drawn or you will be the overwhelming nature of of ignatius will come Hell will attempt to compel you to draw the blade I am Ignatius Ignatius is me I I seek the truth for the light why am i saying what I'd really like this sword does this include like physical deceptions or just like spoken deceptions it Ignatius is the one that decides that okay I'm like trying to sneak it somewhere is he gonna be like no Ignatius is an intelligent blade and you may be able to overpower the will of the blade I'm me and the sword are not gonna get off for now I'm just kind of walking around like this with my arm extended fully out because I have so much like so much happiness from me I'm so proud of myself because I'm actually really proud of myself like I'm super into me you did so well I killed me for this you defeated the fire inside you wait that's bad so can I close the door now the boiler room and go into the I would appreciate if you put that sword away for a moment it would make me feel much better I know you mean that you look so strong though holding that sword okay it's really fiery and away oh thank God I put it away I don't know why I'm just compelled to start talking as well but that's just me in general mm-hmm that'sa normal so are we going to charge baboon we seek truth I've changed I changed down here you guys want to set some shields up and open up the vault of the Vaughn castles let's do it for the light all right only for knowledge first get baboon to move the shield and the light shines that the aperture is lose chimpanzee he is about okay Babbage and von Z oh it's new names chin boys at the aperture so you move the morning angel correct and you're gonna shine it into the aperture of the other door yeah does it go that far yes the light does go as a solid team yes the light shines through the aperture and just as before the brickwork illuminates the door twists and rotates and opens up and the light shines straight through and he hits the Guardian directly and the Guardian as the light washes over the Guardian there's this grinding of metal as it steps forward out from the wall and cracks it's metal fists I impose the baboon shield I grab that over and show that I impose it in between the light as the light fades the guardian walks back into the wall okay and rests okay yeah so you have the one shield place on the morning angel you have the baboon shield and you have one extra shield when I did that did the door closed immediately the door because we were in the room when it so we need to go around the other way yeah do you want to wait here with the baboon shield and we'll go yeah do the other side all right okay let's see yeah let's go try to hold this big shield we take the other two shield no there's one in the morning angel one weirdo has one okay thanks for carrying there's one in the morning angel Pluto has one with the baboon and I'm guarding and Vale has one and I'm going with Vale around to the other okay so you're in the other room wait yeah so you know you we need both shields no you just use the one to open the door yeah out of the room and then the other one just to block the light some hit hitting the golem and then I can walk in well last time we didn't hit the goal and we shone the light from the statue a little bit lower and we still were able to reflect her without waking up the the guard yeah on this side so we can do the same thing as we did that time we didn't shine it right at the golem so we do not same okay so I need to know where are you putting each of the shields right now Pluto has one yeah and you're just carrying one we're just carrying one okay yeah and we're gonna go to the other side of the door that Pluto is on yeah I'm gonna hold it in front of the golem and yeah we'll we'll open up the chamber here we're good with the riddles we do so well so put me in front of the other app okay so you have one of the shield's installed on the morning angel mm-hmm yep who is carrying another shield me you have another shield and I have the third one and you have the third one okay I remove it from imposing itself between the door mm-hmm and and the crying angel okay so it opens the door okay so the door opens up and I catch the light with the shield and you catch the light with the shield and what where and now now so the the door is open yep Vails god the light and you're reflecting it straight back the way it came I'm twisting it towards because there was the name the shiny nameplate yes so right now you've got one shield what what are you doing with the other shield now I walk into the room okay and I'm gonna go over to the other side okay and I'm gonna do the one from the light hitting the floor coming into the room I'm gonna aim it at that seam because we have to do the double aperture okay guys same time let's let's move those lights towards the light trying to direct them I'm like okay guys let's move them towards this thing so that they bounce off and hit the door one two three move the light bounces off the plate and two beams hit the double aperture in the center doorway there is a creaking of metal and ash rumbling of stone as the aperture is closed rotate and separate revealing a room beyond and that's where we're gonna take our break and we are back from our break oh and I want to just give a big shout out to tabletop audio WWII for all your ambient

games on Kickstarter with that let's return to the ruins where our heroes have unearthed ignatius the flame tongue Pluto Jackson holds aloft this silver blade with a golden hilt that is overall not terribly adorned the blade itself is all just the silver material that just flares ever so slightly up at the top and when you swing it there's just this lick of flame Intel you utter its command word Ignatius and it becomes wreathed in golden flames that's so cool I feel like this will bring no ill God remains on to our party this will be the greatest gift we have ever gotten and I will treat it with the utmost respect and I promise I won't just pull it out randomly to get people to tell the truth like the greatest day diet review was blade to you in your mind River the truth and the light shall show you the way and I will cleave the path clear I do not repeat that out loud because it's so is it only when it's activated that the zone of truth happens or is it and so when the when the blade is lit the zone of truth is active ok so you can use two sword or is it a +2 sword all the time it is a +2 sword all the time when the blade is lit it does an extra 2d6 fire damage and when and when the blade is lit it generates a zone of truth that said the curse of the blade is that it cannot it is an intelligent blade that cannot abide deception and when it hears when it detects deception it will attempt to compel its wielder to draw it and shout ignatius thus creating the zone of truth and it might do worse things than that it's got a very very strong will temper temper so we have just opened opened the vault of the Von castles you have just opened the vault alone upon castles the light of ignatius illuminates this chamber it is a this is a diamond shaped chamber with two niches and at the center of which is a statue of the this is the statue that is here is a very famous and common statue many artists throughout history have made their own versions of this and this is a personal one that was commissioned by the von Kessel's and it is called the first paladin contemplates by the river and it is said to depict the first paladin contemplating her duty and the future that would hold above her so it is this statue of her impartial armor with her blade at her feet with her fate with her hand reaching down towards obsessively where the water is with an expression on her face that shows that is meant to reflect the uncertainty of the future but the knowledge that you must go forward no matter what into it and so and all around this statue there are two large niches one contains a burning torch again the similar device is illuminating this torch and all around it are these shelves which have mirrors behind them and upon each is a glass phylactery our rows of glass phylacteries filled with blood and upon each is an inscription the phylacteries themselves are these long vials set into wood in stone and you can see the blood resting upon them at the base in front of them is a large chest and bundled up and there there are several other chests all surrounding it in this room and in addition to that there are there are several sacks and bags and stacks of gold bullion fancy in here you know I believe robbing the fun castle yes no I mean I literally took a von kesselring and wore it for a while until it was taken from me so I mean I took the family lighter so yeah I think we can the glass phylacteries are each embedded with a coat of arms of the Von castles and below them the chest bears the seal of the amethyst Academy Academy what does the amethyst Academy have to the fine castles I mean I feel like out of the three of us I'm the one who would know that but I maybe does it seen your moms tired book I try to recall anything that I've read or anything that I heard well I was at school about a faun castle nothing I go up to this chest is there a way to open it yes it it opens if this is a bomb I open it last word this is filled with letters papers papers be a will and came here for papers beneath the papers there are several mirrors and as she opens it up underneath the letters and the mirrors are premium-grade arcane material components like we're talking the material components that you would use for some seriously expensive spells spells like the like the core materials that would be needed Sebastian that you recognized before spells like scrying clone and simulacrum I don't know any of these spells but I've heard of them in a book Chloe could that be like an audiobook but your mom did oh yeah 100% in her mirrored realm mention all the components here are spells that you would need an arcane lab to execute but then the materials are here I have an arcane lat take them all and there is there is a sealed letter in with with them that bears the seal of the amethyst Academy on it and the signature of Stewart Johann Eisner and I start scooping this group yeah just taking I'm putting the I'm gonna make some spells I carefully bend open the letter like yeah I use my fingernail like a letter opener you open it and I read it this the letter says inset inside to writ an exchange between Archmage Madara and King Brecht Vaughn Castle signed 53 years ago in exchange for a payment of 75 thousand gold pieces and a renewal of the land grants of the Academy Tower of Dragon hime for the next 250 years a procurement of spell casting services of the amethyst Academy in service to the kingdom of Westham are to be paid in securing or aiding and locating and location confirmation of the Royal errors in any crisis of succession the amethyst academy is bound to help us find the heirs of Drakon hi I mean they still own the Tower it may be crumpled and dying but still theirs Oh My gods and Sebastian that's when you realize these are blood samples of the royal family in the phylacteries so when you're missing an heir what's the next best thing oh man we could clone the heir of tracking hime clone or find them do we need their blood - subscribing is that Oscar did it to us we did give him oh man he has so much of your blood right now should I leave should I leave this so much more attention in scrying class somehow the teachers always knew that I wasn't paying attention blood of every student we should put these in into your bag holding like right now yeah these these phylacteries are identical in two construction to the phylacteries that the amethyst academy keeps of every member yeah yeah that's right the amethyst Academy can scribe me whenever they want by the way how many are there factories there are phylacteries for several past generations of von Kessel's and there are phylacteries for Lenoir von Kessel for the for her children for the children as well as for the King as well for the three children so the current generation is on the bottom most shelf whereas previous generations you can can actually see that the Von castles that have been marked as deceased are here incidentally there are several there's several more Vaughn castles that are part of the generation the current generation then that are reflected in just the immediate family for the King had two brothers both of whom had children but the and what both of you recall is that both the brothers were not in Drakon hime on the day and that's why there was a civil war over the course of the Civil War both of them were killed and their families purged whether or not there are still any other survivors amongst the king's brothers is and their children because there's in addition to the king's immediate family both of the king's brothers had in one case one of the brothers had a son and three daughters and one of the others had two sons and four daughters so there were a lot of kids we should take all of them I think just in case there's blood samples of like the brothers yeah and their kids yeah I mean just take the kids can I ask you I'm all for the grave robbing like you know in for a penny in for a pound but is it safer locked down here than it is if we're carrying it around no no then okay that was easy yep thrown in the bag my house I have a lab in the tower and I have a lab at the hooded lantern space and I don't know how to cast these spells but I have a spell that I can learn to contact a wizard who can learn these spells we also needed to meet with the amethyst Academy we can remind them of their duty you know the information needed the cast these spells is not here simply the components to do so no but I'm thinking my mother would know how to cast these spells and I have a ticket to get in touch with my mother oh so she might be able to help us clone we don't want to clone we want to scrub scry see if they're still alive well we can use a bit of blood for scrying and if we scrub we clone them that's Plan B also we have the Queen's blood here maybe a clone of her will be less horrifying how much in terms of components how many components do we have for the spells it's difficult to say because none of you know how to cast the spells okay somewhere between zero and infinity yeah yeah judging by it Sebastian you can make an hour kinda check 9 hard to tell looking over the wording of this deal this is like one get out of jail free card like the amethyst Academy drives a hard bargain for these kind of services and judging by the way that this document is is worded it's like good for one really necessary spell cool yeah necessary to find the heirs of dragon is there any names that we recognize like that we've met in Drac and I'm other than the Lenore names of various errors or various other men sirs is it just the Von Kessel's or are there because there's like the nephews and nieces but yes only goes back this agreement and the samples here only go back 53 years like bears dad so you've only opened up one box so far whether there's not more information there might be more here so do you think we should use that fancy light machine and get a copy of this letter just in case you know like water happens I like that yeah and then we'll keep it like hidden in the vault or something like a copy that photography robot is still around right yeah okay I'll be right back and I got some copies find the the leg robot and I poker yeah and leucon says I would love to take more more images for you but I'm spent for the day okay then we make your like show off like we did a bunch of selfies at some point we should probably get a copy of this and wave it in a rivers face they're judging around there is probably at least 25,000 gold pieces in gold bullion each piece bearer is stamped with the seal of the royal family of Dragonite if one or five of them go missing who's gonna notice old is malleable enough you probably rub the seal off it's fine I mean given it it's it's a lot of gold it weighs a lot as well does elder the immense strike you as a person who cares about a royal seal on a farm hmm maybe you could question things let's make I don't know what he's gonna live you know it all depends there's a lot you can do with that much money could come back to us maybe we leave it yeah there are things other containers here there is one other container that appears to be the largest container has not been opened yet well I grew up to it I grew up to it I'm looking for more stuff because I had my dad's name I'm like there could be more stuff over my dad in here and I like open it up you open it up and inside is inside the largest chest it's a square chest that opens up and you can almost hear this hissing sound as it opens up as it's been preserved and inside is a it is velvet lined on the inside and there is a large book bound in plated metal and gold and leather that bares the crest of the LaVon castles on it and then beside it is an envelope sealed with the seal that you recognize of Johann Eisner it is his personal seal on it and then beside it still are three glittering diamonds and the holy symbol of the sacred fire laid over another letter I don't know how much we want to take from here because they come in here and find this Diamonds missing we should probably leave those but I opened the letter from My Father and that's stamped my father because I feel like I'm a mission to do you turn it over and as you turn turning over it says on the outside the will of King Ulrich von Castle to be opened in the presence of the high flame keeper and the King's steward only Oh hmm maybe I shouldn't open this question can we reseal the being closer is anything just just sealed with wax um you could the first digit 8 - like no it appears to be EP 2 can I control it that much I don't know yeah you know what well it's chaotic times like I mean maybe we gotta just know what's in there but doesn't make it invalid if we open it up when they're not there we don't have a Stuart that's the only thing you're the Stuart am i the Stuart am I like in my eyes should we do it at least in front of flame keeper I think so yes there you can make a history check with advantage sixteen opening this will if you could not seal it back again would completely cause a crisis of legitimacy yeah let's not do this so you could open it you could try to read it but if you were opening up and you weren't be able to seal it again or someone suspected that it had been opened prior that could be used to argue that it isn't a fake and we have a truth seeker now in our group so I feel like lying about I cannot abide yeah I feel like we should hold off and at least get the flame keeper to look over and maybe the commander I mean I guess he would be another one whoever the current steward is we could consider someone the current steward and at least if we had one of them like the flame keeper well who has the stewards badge do we get the queen of Thieves involved in this she can just like hey do you want to see a will yeah well just get flame keeper oh philia read and the queen of Thieves into a room and we're all good you know I think we get the the commander as well as the flame keeper that's that should be enough but well maybe we'll ask them this is really important this is what you came to Drakon time for yeah I really wanted to read it but we can't risk we can't risk the information being in that letter I know what you want more than to read it is for the information in that letter the truth to be true there's so more more and more stuff here and I was gonna say there's another letter here that's underneath these diamonds right there's a book there's a okay it's a large dome I take out the book and I put it on the ground cuz why not and I start to like open it you open up to the first page and it is entitled the line of the Vaughan castles and as you flip through the pages it is it describes in detail the family tree of the Vaughn castles with entries on each fan remember and individual images taken by the lantern Archon taken by the camera Archon beside them describing describing them should take this back to the Queen I'm sure she would love to see ya it's like a photo album her children and beneath it the the book contains the full line of all of the families that are related to the Von castles and the histories of and notes like the entire lineage of the Von castles going back right out to the last generation oh my gosh I'm totally gonna spend some time reading this want to be like expert historian on the Von castles and dragon hime hmm the the latest entry in it describes a marriage between one heiress Jackson and Leonard on Castle Leonard you mentioned Leonard didn't you yeah he's your know what you've already told us this part yeah he's my nephew well awesome he's your nephew or no lenin's on your neck or your net your nephew the woman was generally not your nephew he's not my nephew no he's my further as an entry there's a line crossed between heiress Jackson and Leonard Vaughn Castle indicating their marriage he's this another line extending with a empty point and a note indicating expected so Leonard was the the king Stein he was the Prince of Jews the prince of drachma and he was married to heiress Jackson and they had an expecting child yes so and Leonard was the the oldest child correct yes so technically there's another Jackson potentially while Javon Castle if Leonard is not alive and their son is would they they would be the the air yes by the assuming a the system of succession yeah amongst the von Kessel's is not a strictly patriarchal or a matriarchal line of succession okay the king the King declares which of their children is the heir okay so could be Catarina or could be Eliza as well but depending on what this wheel says it could be that's your nephew is yeah it's what's I think that's what we came here the other set of documents are documentation and photographs of the marriages of the Vaughan castles and other and also noting the births of children and essentially a complete record of the family history including a the last document here is a confirmation of marriage signed between King Ulrich Ulrich von Kessel and Lord Saul Jackson witnessed by high flame keeper Craig hora golden brow and the King's steward Johan Eisner between leonard van kessel and heiress jackson and attached to it is a holy document confirming the consummation of this union these documents are dated mere weeks before the meteor hit that's what I'm after there can I see that yes but what are you gonna do with it I hand you the well they're the documents separate or the in they are they're part of the dot like they're the they're the top of the stack of documents okay I hand you those documents this is this is it this is it what does that prove we have multiple possible errors it seems depending on the will as well as the well living min it's been 15 years and none of the other errors have shown up but you thought that doesn't mean they're not able that air you know about yeah you can produce an heir to the throne back in honey yeah you actually you know him he's is he in Cass back in gasp yeah oh my gosh Jairus Jackson is Pluto Jackson's older sister so she's alive but you haven't seen Leonard I haven't III I was very young when they got married right before the meteor there's a photo of over the wedding party and a young little Jackson is it are you flexing in this form incidentally the side of the Stewart and Vail are in the photo flexed every time you thought someone was look look over the shoulders on a minor illusion a little Sebastian in the photo and I'm like and there's there's me guys it's not there's not a lot of people in this photo it's it's quite literally the members of the royal families and like Vail literally in the foot in the photo you're like hiding behind a curtain because it like it's clear whatever happened here probably you were too young to understand what was going on but you were just stalking your father mm-hmm right and so the only people that are in this photo are the the Saul Jackson and his family and all work Vaughn castle and his immediate family and the high flame keeper and the steward and it's not even in like it's not a unlike all the other wedding photos that are here it's not like a big extravagant thing with like a ton of people in it it's just these people like all in the back all all in basically in a back room of the Cathedral doing all this documentation and the reason for that is and like you can see looking at all the all the tickets is like clearly all this was really rushed like something wasn't right about this yeah marriage normally they would be such a big celebration and the key thing that you look at it at at all this is when you look at the documents and you look at the photo and you look at the dates on the photo the thing that doesn't add up is that Eris Jackson is showing in the photos and the dates don't add up with where a woman at that stage in her pregnancy would be ergo this was a shotgun wedding well Wow interesting interesting that's love guys that's what love is I I don't know much about politics but the the one that we can't open the the will the will what does that dictate which of these lineages is supposed to be next in line well I guess technically the lineage is the nephew if it goes to the son but like does the will choose whether it's to question mark baby or to Pluto's sister you know I think it the question mark maybe is the nephew if yeah regardless of what the will says if alright c'mon Kessel named any of his children as an error and all three of them are dead then the only eligible choice is George - which under caspian law is not come of age and thus by caspian law the that would make Pluto Jackson Lord region of Drakon Haim I mean that's what I thought Jupiter Jones also had a claim God if he does he better produce some documents we have documents now wait so this is the part I didn't know you didn't tell me about that Caspian law wait oh yeah Caspian law it's all like wait wait wait wait wait maybe you're Stuart wait wait there's there's wait wait wait carry the why Pluto Jackson could be the new king of Drakken temporary king temporary king the new king of jackin hime who will need a new steward and a new court wizard sorcerer and liaison to the animistic Adam a temporary and a new rat Prince and a new and a new execution a new executioner we have a perfectly good executioner we can use we and the Queen you talked to her she wants this does she not the Queen does I still don't fully know what happened what us to find her heirs okay and you are a potential heir well well technically since the Queen is still alive ville none of that matters you know so in order for you to become king of track and I'm the Queen needs to not be alive it'd be a start to be a good start well it depends on what the will says to if if the will wills it to Leonard for example would that not take succession over the Queen's right to the throne yeah reason I avoided politics so it depends on I mean I grew up in the castle so I hear things but it depends on whether we can find what it really depends on what the will says we should probably get that figured out but then it from there when you need to figure out what the line would be and I think that is that is key to figuring out how we can get the the buy-in from everybody else in the city as to you know saving Drakon home to get some semblance of what it was before at least on the right track we need to protect this will because this is this is the if this will becomes tarnished or revoked in any sort of no matter what the truth is I believe in truth now I'm all for truth mm-hmm I seek the truth we need to make sure that it stays because if it if there is any sort of doubt cast on the air it could be total chaos I have a thought more than so now more and more so than the current yeah if when we finish here we're supposed to be planning a meeting between the silver order yep the hooded lanterns and the amethyst Academy yep that could be the perfect time to bring all of this to their attention and make some plans should the Queen be there the queen is depends on her state of mind let's be honest yeah we'll see make that tentative yes so we need to keep these super safe until then I don't think I don't want it getting into the wrong hands I don't want it getting into the queen of thieves hands I don't want to not know about it this this is so important we protect these documents with our lives and we present it to the heads of the factions that we trust I know that we don't trust the amethyst Academy but we also have a document stating that they have a legal obligation to help us in this mission and I believe that River will help us she'll help us I think she'll be on our side if we can convince them that documents saying that this is what is required of the amethyst Academy the amethyst Academy has been sketchy from time to time but River follows the rules of the amethyst Academy that's her thing yeah and these are the rules of the amethyst Academy this is this is a document laid out so I trust showing this to River I do yeah I agree with you do you guys think I think that we should take all of these documents and the blood just in case because again I think we should still based on the we'll find the right heirs I know we have your nephew but if he's not directly the air then we need to be able to look for whoever the will says so Queen Eleanor wants us to find her her children are children and yeah I think that's something that we can at least try to do even if we can give her closure yeah so guys about when we go upstairs and your blades not gonna like this when we go upstairs do we not tell a philia read right away do we wait till the meeting I say we wait to the meeting I say so too we're not if she asks what we found down there we say no walks away yeah you need to leave I go take a nap a power nap we need you to walk away I say we just focus on the bones and and getting that right we need to do that we need to get those bones and we need to get out of here and we put the shields in a safe space so that way other people also maybe can't access them where do you want to put the shields we could I mean there was a secret flame room in prophetess area yeah we could do that with the skull and the bird skull bird we could put two of them back in there nobody will get in it's fine that kind of dismantle is the whole system down here though what if somebody else needs to do anything then they can figure it out yeah because I that's where that's where I was coming from at the start like this whole idea that maybe this is a safe place to keep some of this stuff because if we're walking around with it we're open to the queen of thieves stealing it from us again people grabbing it from us people just leveraging it against us luta alternatively bill I'm concerned that I don't trust these documents anywhere but with us right now yeah that's my concern I understand exactly where you're coming from but if we leave it down here what's stopping the queen of thieves from coming down here and getting them doing what we did she's been everybody she could pose as a person of the church once they resync to fight and just wander down here she has minions she has men she she's a smart cookie I I just thought that I mean she could do all that but that's probably a lot harder than I were walking up and being like give me that thing if she could do that but she wouldn't even know about it how's she know about it I guess how does she know where to come down here to get between us three I I just feel like I want to know where these documents are at all times now could we but I don't know I don't know okay could we leave them in a safe space that my buddy would go to I am scared your dimension the MIR dimension is in the hands of the amethyst Academy I don't know a single place like even our clock tower wouldn't leave the clock I don't trust leaving them in the clock tower I don't I was trying to think of this this whole time anyway they were safer with the Lord of the feast guarding them it's true but now they have the people who killed the lockbox in the executioner yes we just tie to the executioner that we want to leave forever is this a good idea or a bad idea we tie it all to like a little package and we fire an arrow with the package on it into the executioner it just sticks out of them and those documents are safe double-lock check all right documents time to go to your forever home folder like pouches of important stuff he's like a giant we put like a locked double locked chest by the gaping hole in the middle of the square and he's there this time literally is the safest place in tracking hi mine I'm not even gonna lie that nothing's going in there without probably dying including the people that have to put the chest there one way it's a one-way trip for sure that's a potential idea don't run and then dive into the thing put that in the idea Ben let's go get those bones I really though so we're putting the blood yeah I grabbed the vial supplied the and I'm only grabbing the ones for the children of the Queen yep and we only want child's blood just to be variable we only want the child's blood cool that wasn't clear enough we want kids blood not at a context or anything okay so you're gonna take the phylactery I say we take the will for now you can always come put it back and we take the will the family tree the documents and like we reach in my bag of holding cool for now if you lose that bag of holding that's it that's on me I'm gonna guard this thing with my life this is can you put a lock on it I think we should split up some of that stuff okay all right I will take you take the one with your the first one we read the will well with the amethyst Academy or should I take the amethyst amethyst Academy note um Pluto do you want to protect the will I will protect it with my life okay and then I will take the book and then we still have the documents yeah and then put those nearby okay I'll put the documents on the amethyst Academy note tomorrow what about the photographs oh I want all photographs on my dad I'll take the photographs I still have all the other ones from the other room so I'm just like look at my dad look at that cute we're gonna story so you're you don't have a bag of holding the oldest or the minute you have a backpack okay okay guys um guard these with your life with my life Sebastian as you pass the photographs over today Oh some weird about the von Castle kids justice you look at them these kids are weird something about the two daughters that is really familiar that's what's up Sebastian uh-oh is it like this is it the little girl that you sent the hell I mean that I've only told Sebastian that he has felt this I don't I I'm just gonna I'm just gonna mentally pocket that one and hand the pictures over to figure out what about them don't worry about it to be see anything did he it was it pretty obvious make an inside check and Sebastian you what your I think see what's your insight bonus plus four and Sebastian what's your deception plus eight Velen Pluto he looked at that photo for a long time before handing it to trying to memorize their faces or something you can't hide anything from us it's um they they look I can't I can't my brain does this sometimes I see I see their faces sometimes what I don't mean to like just so it could just be that they look like younger versions of cat and mouse look like it they're younger and when I I knew them but similar but it's similar I the eyes there's something about the eyes and these are in the photo who are they depicted as are they daughters the daughters of the Queen and King yeah yeah they're it's something perhaps Sebastian that you'd never noticed before you'd seen paintings and sculptures of them and the Queen's in the Queen's grotto but the the clarity of how they are rendered in the camera are cons images makes the details of the truth of their their details much more obvious I mean Katerina is that is that her name it's one of them and then eliza katerina lies upon Kessel and oh man do we have their blood we do oh man are we going you only sent one of them to help them right i sent one of them to hell and the other one i haven't seen since and it was bad terms it was yeah they were my friends too I mean if they are the same people that you have told us about tonight want years of dragon hunter help right right it couldn't it could I could be mistaken it could be wrong okay we need to we need we need to keep moving I am you know what we will find someone to help us scry and and figure out where they are mm-hmm and there won't be in hell no no no no no no don't worry Sebastian you didn't send one of the heirs of dragon I'm to hell I mean either way I sent a friend to hell and that's I mean that's worse that is terrible this is a lot to digest so like find the bones take some gold like one goal kids blood I don't like I don't I want to leave this room you know what I say though is that we come back to get the the documents recorded using the the light machine Hey yeah the truth will set you free don't don't try to act like you're the sword now okay I am the sword the sword is him you've changed man it's been a long 15 minutes I said you know you're still cool lots of Revelations I say we take the the shields and and make sure that nobody else can get in here Iglesias says in your mind Pluto the shadow of Gil's hangs tightly over this one's heart if you cut it free let's go walk out I'd pick up one of the shields again kind of like okay we only one door open so I pick up the one that is that won't make one of the golems like come up so the one that was pointing to the ground so that way we're not being chased out of here should be also just aim the other one away like aim the sad statue a way so that it's not shining at the golem yeah yeah yeah you're able to aim the statues away and as you turn the stat of the Archangel statues away all of the doors leading into the van kessel vaults reappear and seal perfect okay um well laughs and I have to come back and see if there's anything else but I think we go we're looking for maybe we can take one of the shields and throw it in your bag because if you if we had the shield then no one can for sure I mean we still need the shield's to open the passage to the bones yeah like before before we leave we'll take one of the shields with us really if we could just like take one of the shields and that just snored at our clock tower yeah just like hang it on the wall just so just no we need some art it's feeling a little like wall bear yeah sure good artistic choice okay so what we need to do now is on the west side I believe well there's an aperture on both the east and the west sides oh okay so I have to go back into the room full of let's go to the Safeway maybe it's just two entrances what are the chances that there's a puzzle that involves us using both doors hi let's try the Safeway first see what happens so staying on the side with the lady statue I think okay and going through the the door mm-hmm you shine the lights through the shields by positioning by taking two of the shields you're able to balance the light back into this other doorway and it fades out opening up revealing a roughly hewn passageway of stone that begin that as it continues downward there is a pungent smell in the air and it began and this passageway is almost cavern it is work stone but also there's a natural stone cavern component to it and it continues downward snaking almost in a semicircle and as it does so off the edges of the circle there are more of these portcullis bound crypts which similar to the previous two here which have the various flame keepers entombed in them some of them are actually empty in anticipation for future flame keepers it seems like this passage has been built so that it can be extended if needed and that's why the stonework down here is so rough and it continues in this kind of coiling shape curving gently downward into the earth after you [Laughter] come Ignatius we seek the truth along the ceiling holding up the ceiling is this carved curved stonework and there is this metallic rod again with wheels and little strange clocks on it coming up along this pathway as well what did the clock say they're just kind of taken back and forth in the green yeah and they're on these these steel rods yeah there there there alongside these very thick steel rods that when you kind of tap them they sound hollow like a pipe yes no we don't know what pipes are yeah I guess yeah so they're pipes yeah okay I know these these these clocks they might be reading some sort of pressure what happens if I turn the wheel can I reach it mm-hmm like does it turn yeah and you hear hiss as you open it up and the pressure gauge kind of Rises on the the wheel turn back just a little bit turn back turn it back the other way the hissing stops it sounds like a snake so um it also sounds like the hissing that we saw in the fountain earlier when it was on fire that's a snake pipe it's for snakes to travel through the cathedral and the pipes open and close different gateways we've solved it yeah easy and then and the dial is how many snakes are in it that's a green snake red means or Reds what type of snake huh colored snakes okay Oh words I think riddles you guys we've got riddles it's not even hard anymore easy I don't want to hear the hissing it scares you're not like snakes okay I've eaten a few all through the area here as well there are several niches again with skulls bones and AH Suri's and several of them also there are little shrines beside each of the flame keepers that are entombed that many of them have vials of clear liquid or piles of what looks like this bluish gray powder or this thick white salt arrayed in on the altar in front of the sarcophagi you see it was like salt yeah I go up and I kind of touch it and see it's it's odorless but it's not salt I taste it it tastes really bad yeah yeah it's not edible yeah just like Yama is a very like content nitrous sort of taste if she says it's not edible yeah it is gross yeah don't do that um do I know what it is thanks for trying like that her first instinct is just Eve it's a cool making an intelligence check 5 no idea it doesn't taste good doesn't taste good probably wouldn't put it on my food only probably I press the digitated and it tastes good slap your kind of like chalky almost in its in its in its taste it it's really not tasty yeah it's more the texture now than the taste give me today's good you go for another bones or something oh then I hate dead people yeah let's let's keep moving guys yeah I want to get out of this crypt yeah that's a snake pipes and stuff but you'd be flammable the whole thing coils deeper down into the earth and you continue down this passage for some time before it opens up into a large cavern deep underneath the Cathedral here supported by pillars of stone there are more of these pipes and a lake of a thick yellowish black liquid which a sour odor hangs in the air and this thick the sour odor that's like rotting eggs hits your face the sulfur and rotting eggs and in and amongst this pool this large pool this cavern itself some 100 feet wide the pipes reach down into this pool and around them are supported the bones of organized the ancient dragon whose hardened rust-colored scales are like plate armor over his skeleton we were we can take his bones right that was that was one of the DI was one yeah it was one of them and we need to find like a hip or head or a joint hip Arab a murder Emer looking up at this thing I suddenly don't want to take its bones because I'm scared also question what are you using for light are you relying on your dark vision I'm I'm in the dark I'm in the dark should we have a rope and you can follow us bring us back to the rat's nest days so you know how when we lit things up before and the skeletons came alive Pluto there is a giant dragon skeleton in this room I know you can't see it well I have a drift glow no I'm sorry but it's so powerful it would light up this whole room and then we'd probably get eaten to this you'd be hearing whisper this is my brother in battle organized who's flame burned hotter than my own let no light disturb him unless the end of days is truly upon us my sword is telling me that we're gonna stay in the dark so now for those old days those grand days drew vo and argonath we three yes to walk astride the world and bring the light of truth yeah he was just saying that he he's reminiscing and looks for he he really likes to stay in the dark I are the bones like over this lake yeah I can you I look in like I said the front claws are posed on the edge and the skull kind of it's this is was a massive dragon like this thing is 50 feet long and its skull itself is bigger than your body it is the type of thing that could could have swallowed you whole in its day and you can tell that it's the outer shell of it like the scales of it haven't decayed at all at all because they themselves are metal and whatever this liquid is is not water because the scales themselves have this this rusty red color but it's like a sheen to them and it's not rust that gives them that this color so so it's surrounded by this nasty liquid um it's almost like the scales themselves would have been they have this reddish like actually you can't even see the because you're using dark vision because you can't you can't see the color but they might be either red or gold do I see any signs of same for Trujillo's no we just need these right I think so how big is a femur his big toe his big toe is like the size of your hand it's like one like if you put your hands to get like your all your arms together those would be like his knuckles but we need a bigger bone correct it's the smallest bone on the dragon but it's still a pretty big bone yeah but that would be enough from what they were doing cause we saw like if you took the claws off of his digits they would be like short swords okay [Music] I'm pretty sick of being down here Pluto can factor that job I what's the worst that can happen I walk up and I grab one of the claws and I start to pull make his drink check because it's by the edge of the water like a I fall backwards and just like tumble to the floor Oh Pluto I think you might have to do this one okay lead me all righty I walk him over and I place his hands on the toe of the dragon and I'm like pull there with some effort you were able to pull pull the claw the right claw of the Truvia the right claw of argonath free it's stupidly heavy it's like carrying several long swords and a suit of armor but you've got it let's get out of here let's get this upstairs like this thing this claw itself is like the size speak it out horse we could all like help help help them out we might still need the trio's I thought they only needed one know me both did they say one or the other I think they wanted both it's ideal well I mean we can drop this off upstairs okay we have to go to the other side to get to same thing yeah we got the bone so we climb all of those winding stairs Pluto dragging yes I'm carrying it yeah two handing it though it takes a while I assume because of how heavy it is and how I'm not helping Sam and we we get you guys don't even give me light nothing happens so when we take a trip most of the way oh I thought that I thought slightly in Falls as the weight now is on the bone but the whole system is keeping the skeleton ice cream when it shifts and I kind of run to the door but I like slow down when I realize that nothing's happening and I try to casually just walk it off hey oh just getting rid of a cramp yep okay guys and then we go all the way back up okay you heads all the way back up to through the passages back to the top to where the the angel this the Archangel Gabriel Allah is and seated there at the stairs looking down our Petra and Elena hello her aren't you supposed to be helping the Queen yes no me yeah yeah you guys are on Queen duty and Petra she smiles rather warmly and she sighs and she says the Queen herself wanted to see how things turned out she's here like what upstairs um and Elena speaks up and she lowers her gaze and says oh yes the Queen's here and so is Leonor now I kind of regards that weirdly but it's like doesn't quite put two and two together what do you mean by that can you elaborate petra system that is a huge dragon claw yep she and seeing seeing this commotion Elena turns and she cries out they're back they're back they brought it and there is that you can hear commotion within as several several others members of the hooded lanterns and the silver order rush towards the stairs to help you with the Dragon Claw little pull out your sword I pull out Ignatius done to the damn word and I say I summon you Ignatius show me the truth fire blazes up the sword and the assembled people gasp at the light of the blade and I and the one of the paladin's of the silver order says it's Ignatius the blade of the truly oh the light is blessed us indeed and there's there's just shouting as everyone is amazed at what you've done and brought brought up wait I enjoy the shouting and I enjoy the amazement Elena what is your name she turns and in the chaos of all the people being shocked she sees the blade and she makes a break away away as the triumphant paladin's cry out around you that this is a mate this is amazing she's like slipping into the larger chamber the range of the of the of the area could I try to cast Webb on her you absolutely can so as she turns to run I throw out Webb okay she makes a dexterity saving throw and she gets an 18 so I technically I guess we should roll for initiative then no shoes this is a bold move that I'm making right now you're going for it I mean we have a truth stick we have the queen of Thieves trying to lie her way through this and I just I'm I saw an opportunity there's so many paladin's around if I can make her just say that she is not who she says she is we have so many people around here right now yes we're going for it I'm sweating I'm sweating here what do you got 13 20 26 okay so passion 13 yeah 24 Pluto 26 for me eBay okay I'm so scared okay okay so veo Sebastian has drawn his wand and on your turn Sebastian that's when the no webs will be cast okay okay veo mmm-hmm you see Sebastian is going for her his wand as Elena is turning to leave how far away is she for me okay we she is you're at the top of the stairs mhm and she is 30 feet away from you okay cast Zephyr strike and use my feeling agility and I it's probably overkill but I dash towards her and I like go to rugby tackle to like essentially grapple her okay I'm like you know what comes out yet claws out because I want to get her down on the ground cool yep alright so that go for do horse right and or are there any rules for that yeah so you're trying to grab her so you may so we make an opposed strength checks okay 14 okay I get a 13 so you win so you grab her do you and you want to try to pin her to the ground I guess what I'm trying to do is like momentum grab my arms around her arms and my legs around her waist okay and try to like way or down so you got her grabbed and you want to try to knock her prone that or just grab her disadvantage your web sore no I might end up wiping both of you that's right if I can get her hers you've got her speed is zero yeah so she is there in in place yeah you know when you like wrap around and then your hands are on the back of their head like you back hold on she's not going anywhere you know it's your turn I make my way through the Paladins okay very epically like I I imagine that they part I go hard make way for no she owes and I and I walk up and I say and I and I slowly lower the blade towards Elena mhm and I say reveal yourself for we do not abide deceptions in front of Ignatius anything else you'd like to do with your turn I do like a little pose pose at the end and I point and she turns back and I'm right up to Raymond right you have the you have the blade out and the sword speaks to you as you point the blade at her and it says what exactly are we doing here with this woman she's a she's a fraud makers say some really like embarrassing stuff and tell her tell everyone who she really is I mean you can't do that but he doesn't reject his own the truth it's close okay do the whispering thing in her head okay do the whispering thing okay and so as you lower the blade and like just kind of like pointing it at her okay I'm not like trying to like stab her and I'm not trying to it's more like it just I want it I want the cool factor okay as I pointed at her and I'm like within like five feet of her when I'm doing this she was like 30 feet and pea tackle there yep okay so she looks at you I'm like still getting my wand out apparently yes your wand oh yeah yeah because we're gonna go for though you're still gonna go for the web maybe depends what happens right now okay so I have to make a charisma same intro okay Ignatius says to you this one's lies as one lies in her heart but she the darkness that surrounds her the lies that surround her I cannot force it out of her she has succeeded her saving throw against the zone of truth so you know this so remember with zone of truth until the spell ends a creature that enters the spell area for the first timer starts his turn there makes a Christmas saving throw and I failed save it can't speak a deliberate lie you know whether they succeed or fail but they an a creature that's aware of the spell knows so you know that she's in it but she succeeded her saving throw does she know that she's succeeded yes yeah a creature a creature in the area of zone of truth is aware of the effect yeah okay it's the Queen's enos yeah and and for the record it's DC 15 for the saving throw on yeah okay it's not her whole turn so she she looks up and she says commander commander what are they doing why get off of me Vale oh my remote grab hold on door it's very clean right now she tries to break out of the ground oh the grapple okay hurry ranks she it's your strength versus her dexterity Oh ten and I get a five so you managed to keep keep her held she resists and struggles but she is still stuck in your grasp Sebastian are you still gonna cast web I since she's already stuck in the grasp I'm gonna walk up and I'm gonna like put my foot on her okay to try to help hold her down and I point my web right at her head and I'm readying an action that if she tries to make a break for it I'm going to cast web if she like runs I'm gonna cast it at her and I just point my web at her and I say reveal yourself you're outnumbered mmm there's nobody here to help you as you as you do so you are now standing in the opening of the in front of the altar of the flame pointing it this at her and you look looked down and you can see in the hall are several other people there is standing in in the hallway are the Lord Commander and the nightcap in the in the sorry in the cathedral Hall all looking at this unfolding is the Lord Commander Elias Drexel Theodora marshal the night captain and Eldrick and River are here and so is Queen Lenore okay have to be committed to this choice and they're all looking at this okay like they everyone is looking at the three of you right now like you've gone crazy and in the in the midst of all that all this Petra and Ansem charge at you veo and try to rip you off of Elena has it them and to other herded lanterns another hooded Lantern comes up to Sebastian tries to knock you to your feet as well so you guys can make you make to oppose strength checks and you can make one oh yeah seventeen and one okay I get 19 and 17 so basically Ansem and another one of the the Queen's guards grab you veo and rip you off of Elena and Sebastian another hooded Lantern tackles you I got an 18 and pushes at you but they only get a 12 so you you stay there another one of the hood lanterns tries to pull Elena to her feet can I yell anything you you absolutely can can light them I she's not who she says she is she's not who she says she is she is an impostor and there is shock in amongst everybody as a booming voice resounds out from Ophelia Reed and she says this is madness now y'all are fighting right in front of the altar of the sacred flame you lay down your arms right there and right then and there this is no place of violence you do it now and whatever quarrel you might have with that woman we can talk it out like reasonable human beings I don't think we can I don't think she's gonna give us the chance Ignatius has found it's deception and it seeks to reveal the truth and I look to the Paladins for some sort of support for they must see that Ignatius is trying the Fuhrer Marshall looks to a philia and he's and he says are you sure he whispers something to her you can hear him saying that's the blade of the Truvia it tells all the truths that we need to know is there some deception of foot and he turns to the Lord Commander and the Lord Commander says Elena is one of my most trusted soldiers what are you doing you three have you gone crazy down there and I turned to the Lord Commander and I say on my father's life this woman is not Elena and I look I'm like dead in the eye make your persuasion check with advantage eleven fail your father was a good man I trust his word but you three have always been loose cannons if you're gonna attack one of my soldiers right now if you've got an issue with her if you found something you can't just take this into your own hands you have to go through me now let her go and stand down and put down that flaming sword if there's gonna be anyone whose justice in this city it is me and the Queen I'm disappointed that you haven't learned that our actions are truthful in what we do I'm disappointed that you don't trust me enough yet to make my own decisions with my own soldiers you should have come to me first if you had a problem with anybody she's not one of your soldiers this is a discovery that we are taking action on right now we're really winging it sir and we can't you have to bind her hands and then we'll explain but we cannot Petra let her go where's Petra she Petra is holding on to Elena Petra what were the words that she spoke right before this action what did she say on the stairs she said that the Queen was here that Lenore was here what were her exact words you looked at her puzzled at the way she said the words yeah she said the Queen was here in Lenore was here - what other Queen do we know Petra what other Queen Petra looks at Elena and Elena has this blank look on her face and Petra speaks up dad I think they might be onto something I'm gonna take Elena down and the Lord Commander just says damn it all and Petra wrestles Elena to the ground that-a-girl thank you it's tense I'm shaking I am pointing I'm I guess I'm being wrestled by you you've been like pulled away like Ansem has actually got you he's grabbed you he's I stopped I stopped like that's a let her go and my quarrel is not with you Ansem it's with supposed Queen over there we are here to bring justice to this place and we're here to bring truth to this place not words I thought I'd say you're being really truthful right now right now seems like the only moment and if I if I go back on this Lord Commander if I stop pointing my wand I'm terrified of the consequences I have to follow through with this I've committed to this I think I need her to tell us who she is Elena you are not who you say you are she smiles and she says no I'm not and you don't have as much control over this situation as you think you do that's freaking out here play-doh I'm freaking out just keep pointing okay just keep pointing it's really confident there's going to be a knock at the door any moment now God you better answer it better send someone to answer it cuz that someone's come to talk to I just wanted to make sure I was here for the fireworks wait one pardon there's a knock at the door of the grand Cathedral I what is it who is it fireworks guys I'm gonna go answer it is she gonna so it's the fireworks the bomb I don't know but I'm pretty sure it is I go to the door I after kind of like shaking off Ansem and I open it you open the door and there is a crowd of people outside normal looking people with shards of delirium in their chests and in front of you as you open the door is the plain face of Lucretia Matthias I shut the door problem right now what do you mean how did she don't be our biggest problem I turn to the flame again I turned to the flame people keep her and say your bestie is here and I open up the door again situation she said and Lucretia Mathias takes a step into the cathedral with two of her others and she says very softly may I come in Oh feel you run this one yeah I'm gonna take point on this yeah we were already way over our heads right now I have heard that you have taken the Cathedral and I have come to see that it is sanctified again in the name of the light and the fire well I mean yeah it's just a whole party in here we have the light Lucretia can you just like give us a moment while here goodness out we have the fire we're gonna come there that there is a problem that you are having yeah defile the flame with your violent act I'm trying to bring truth to this place that's that's the act of this that's why we're here truth and light truth and lies or someone else has brought deception and violence a person you see before you is the one who brings the violence and deception to this place we are the truth and the light the mostly Delana smiles for a moment and says maybe we should all just talk this one out don't you think this has been a long awaited meeting don't you think I don't know look around I say everyone's here everyone's here yeah everyone was there when Oscar yarn was there too and he just teleported the hell out of there mmm-hmm but mmm I take a look at Vale and I take my foot off of her but I keep my wand I keep my wand pointed at her and I back up she she's been wrestled to the ground by petrol so she's yeah like my foot wasn't really doing he's like the Lord Commander speaks up mages are here the amethyst Academy the silver order these pilgrims we've all come here to the grand Cathedral cuz we want something we all want this city to be a what it was in the name of the Von castles drakon hime Wes Tamar and the light this is I don't know what to do from here but I'm taking control of this situation as Lord Commander of Dragon hime everyone answers to me now we're just gonna talk and put down all the weapons all right sounds good since I mean keep her under wraps but yeah keep her apprehended you he points at the night captain and you you all got a bunch of problems to work out here you can tell that he does not know what to do with the situation can she turn back to a real form show your cell at least your truce and not the imposter it Elena she winks at you I've got nothing to hide and that's where we're gonna enter the night so much emotions he did it good I ain't scared over anymore I'm scared I was scared
