[Music] Drakken dimers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway car emits rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] good evening and welcome back to dragon hime this is our weekly dungeon and Dragons fifth edition game with the dungeon dudes that's me dungeon master mati Martin and I'm Kelly McLaughlin and I'll be playing Sebastian Crowe the half elf shadow sorcerer and we're joined today by our good friends dilben itis playing Bayeux sin yet the tip backseat gloom stalker Ranger and Joe O'Gorman playing Pluto Jackson the human battle master the last time we left our heroes they had crossed the ruins of Drakon Heim venturing from the recently conquered clock tower vales former hideout in the center of the city crossing the city through the market square the theater row and past the grand guild hall our heroes came to the barracks of the hooded Lantern the fortress of the old city watch and Drakon high military within the city walls there they cut a deal with the commander of the hooded lanterns a man named Elias Drexel in exchange for a letter of marque permitting them to scour the ruins as needed our heroes agreed to turn over 20% of everything of value they find in the ruins to the hooded lanterns in addition they made a promise to the commander that if they would find any information on what the followers of the following fire or the paladin's of the silver order are planning in Drakon Hein that they would report it back in the midst of all this they uncovered that the badge that veo has been keeping for some time is matched by the badge owned by the commander both of these are amulets marking the bearers as members of the small Council those who counseled the king of Drakon Heim before the city's fall what abilities that this badge might have or unlock within the city the commander seemed to be interested in but his oaths prevented him despite his better judgement from seizing it from the avail so in the meantime you still have your father's badge as the steward of Drakon Heim I'm one piece of memory from him after agreeing to spend the night in the barracks with the hooded lanterns our heroes now plan to rendezvous with their old friend river of the amethyst Academy at the Ackerman mill where our adventure began for the first time did they like our play they did of course if you all remember from last week having seized some costumes from some pageant wagons found in theater row vo Pluto and Sebastian decided to put on an impromptu performance for the hooded lanterns which was met with some revelry and a barrel of water down Mead and so the evening with the hooded lanterns are talking with Petra and some of her other campaign treants and a few the other hooded lanterns that you've known for some time veil the evening passes with a little bit of merriment the hooded lanterns are a little bit on edge but your good humor takes the edge off despite the fact that Petra's brother Ansem is very unimpressed with your antics we're just so personable like this brother we're gonna work were key we're just quirky so we have a mil to head to as you bed down for the evening the hooded lanterns direct you down to the dungeons underneath the barracks for that is where their own bunks are now captain fortunately for the hooded lanterns deep enough underground that they've managed to carve out some sleeping quarters that allow them to avoid the worst effects of the haze in the city but for anyone else that's camping out overnight they have they say they have to change their guards over quite often and make sure that they give people a fair amount of time outside the city walls themselves because staying here in their barracks as much as they're trying to hang on to it with the influence of the haze there are a large number of hooded lanterns that are quite sick and ill and you can see that their infirmary spaces are pretty packed I wonder if there's ever a material that they could put to like block the haze interesting yeah let me go make a shield er yeah or maybe like how to clothe that what if we made armor out of it and then we can wear it I can wear out of that's for what the Hays Journal miracle oh yeah just Hays are we just really have we're not gonna make a wall to back see for the evening goes on in fairly late but the hooded lanterns are up at the crack of dawn there's a mustering horn that wakes you up it rate as the Sun rises or though although you can't see the Sun from inside the city not the least of which because the haze and the fog covers things over but as soon as there's first light the hooded lanterns are so do they kind of just gas them okay I think this is first lying I think the sun's rising and they err on the side of getting up early so by the time any of the hooded lanterns are up and running and getting their breakfast started in the camp of their breakfast being a pretty meager amount of gruel warm bread and what nuts and fruits and supplies that they have it in the campsite they are already rousing in darkness pretty much and by the time the rest of you are all up there's hints of light coming through the clouds above but again with the haze and the clouds overhead it's probably still early in the morning it's another reason why I didn't stay with the hood and lanterns river feeds me way better I'm also not a fan of getting up this early I am a man who likes my sleep that's all in caspia we wait for the Sun to usually tell us to get out I wait for my body to wake up naturally at about noon most days like a servant you have called the Sun correct he's not even my son she's just Petra says in Drakon hime we believe that every minute of light is a minute that you don't have to spend hiding from monsters so we take advantage of much daylight as we possibly can that's why we're all up at the crack of dawn every day because we've got to get out there get hunting get supplies and make sure that the roots are at least somewhat under control at night things are far too dangerous so we want to make sure that we seize every advantage we have an every minute of daylight is a minute where we have the advantage and not the monsters make sense for you I completely disagree but I like the darkness I try to stay out most of the night it's easier to navigate a night the haze and the glow of of the meteor as you take your breakfast in the mess hall that the Haunted lanterns have assembled Petra asks are you one to stay with us for a few days or where are you going next we have some errands to run actually got to use our new pass to try going in and out of the city from across one of the tables Anson speaks up I can't believe the commander showed you that kind of mercy I can't believe you're still as rude as you are listen you might have saved Petra but you're still mercenaries and that means you can't be trusted you're you're only here as long as you're getting paid and being able to keep a little bit of what you scour from the ruins all those things are the rightful property of the people of dragon hime and you're just stealing them hey wait we are the people are you guys are you in Petra twins yes Petros my sister okay cool and I go back to eating yeah I mean I am the people of Dragon hime so technically yes some of it or all of it does belong to that partially me some of us are actually doing something for the city actually yeah yeah they're all around you right now they're all around you right now of course they are all the people here have bled for Drakon hime can you say the same yes yes yeah in a pit with rats everything you've bled for you plan for yourselves no that's one way to look at it but you can be incorrect but there's no point arguing with idiots they think they're right so we're gonna go back to our meal thanks for the conversation all right but with that he look he finishes his gruel and storms off my ears are just a little bit like flags I'm just like as much as I enjoyed calling him an idiot I'm just like he's very intimidating I'm not intimidated by him he's a good soldier like I can respect his ability but you know he's just held back by you know his own no he's one of us respects him so far everything I've seen from that man is horrible and I have no respect for him and I've no reason to talk to him any further than I have to this is not a people person maybe we just have to figure out who hurt him and then we can make it better if he keeps talking to me like that I'm gonna hurt him we're practicing this a ghost yeah as you finish your breakfast you realize that you're amongst the last to leave the mess hall to hood owners have already must be so distracted and many of the patrols are already out for the day the few hooded lanterns that take two horses or open up the hound kennels and have their hunting dogs with them already set out on patrol and the garrison is Manning its itself as well doesn't seem like there's anyone left to send you off Petra says a brief goodbye as she heads to her patrols but that's all there is bye say bye to your brother for me we'll see you soon and stay safe keep surviving you too will do do we get our weapons back when you when you go to leave you will be giving your weapons back okay just checking they might I don't want them to compensate my new javelins they give you just a normal chaplain back I'm gonna be so mad this one had it I remember what it wrote in it I don't remember how to say it had things wrote in it wrote in it written in it are you all gonna step off and leave now yeah yeah let's it out I'd you leave the quartermaster I read good a man who looks like in his earlier days might have been quite portly but you can see the skin is sagging off him because he hasn't eaten as many proper meals now return to your equipment to you it's been well taken care of and as you leave the gates the commander is there and says I don't expect you back any time soon but if you do find anything out let us know we may want to check on those paladin's and for you know whatever we find out we'll report back when we're back on our way through the city we'll be keeping an eye on them from a distance but if you can get any word from inside there we'd love to know if you find out any information about a ways in and out of the castle you let us know you've got a deal so long commander ye safe travels later with that you exit through Shepherds gate the hooded lanterns open the gates for you which are still in full operation it's a pair of portcullis that they raise up the set of double gates and doors on either end and that short passes through and as you step through the gate you can see that the gatehouse itself the wide opening channel of Shepards gate which in its heyday would have been flocks of cattle would have come here into the cattle pens but overhead you can see all the murder holes that the hooded lantern so set up overhead all and all the different arrow slits along the side from which the hooded lanterns can attack someone that tries to make their way through this gate the little fortress here is under good garrison it would take quite a lot of effort to dislodge the hood lanterns as fused as few of them as there are the fortifications of Drakon Heim are pretty impressive all right well we knew we made a good decision not to fire way through this gate guess we can we can have a standing deal for now yeah with this tax I'm winking you come through the other side of the gates the hooded lanterns do have a small stockade assembled on the other side of the gates they've dug a ditch that then they built a palisade kind of an a semicircle around it that has another drawbridge an extra level of defense on both sides of the gate a pair of the hooded lanterns at that side lower the small wooden plank platform as you go across and they raise it up quickly as you leave the ditch itself is filled with a lowly little amount of water and several sharpened stakes all along the edge you can see that there's a few rattling skeletons and a bits of bits of leftover Knoll still in there it seems that even with all these defenses once in a while the Knowles and rattling still try to make a push don't fall into this pit I make zero promises Klunk Klunk usually why would you say now I'm on the defense I'm assuming you're coming after me alright so you're making back for the mill the mill the mill Eckerman mill wonderful more names are crossed off okay you take a familiar path if we can open up our map we'll take a look here you're taking a well-trodden path you've come this way several times before and with vales expertise in your memory of the way you have a few back alleys and hidden paths that you can quickly bring the group down you pass by to yourself the old rat's nest Tavern off on a side road as you head along Shepards way making for the karin hills as always this is a ramshackle and run down part of Drakon Heim a part of the city known as the sprawl the newest part of the city relatively speaking mostly wooden buildings that have burned out almost completely making it fairly easy to see far down the road what's coming for you or what you might be running from aside from when you go back into the side streets do you take the side streets or just the main road what do you think there where's the safest route is it in the day it's days it is same time but Drakon Heim is dangerous day or night so I mean I think let's be cautious and take the side streets okay okay you head along the side streets before you come back to heading along kind of taking this shortcut up along Shepards way to where eventually you'll come to the Karen fields the Karen hills you manage to spend but it only takes you about 45 minutes an hour before you're right at the edge of the city limits safely it's around here that veil you smell rat really heavily as you come back along the road and looking down you can see in the mud in front of you are the footprints of dozens of rattling and a deep groove in the middle of the footprints I asked them to bring the iron to the mill we did these are probably those rattling perfect looking down looks very recent oh I mean recent do I see tracks coming back the other way no oh they might still be there it might have taken them as long to drag that thing up here as it did for us to do everything you have your tower rest Wow yeah good for them they deserve I don't know a pat on the back yeah we'll give them praise in the form of words cheap easy to use words sounds good for them yeah they're they follow a rather meandering path occasionally dragging themselves into the side of a building or into a farmhouse kind of going in a very erratic way around trees buildings and back down back roads and on and off the street again as the pathway meanders its way towards the Eckerman though I'm so proud I'm actually really proud of these guys where you go I just imagine them like like the weight kind of like that's wrong is that even though they try to like make up for it and they tell that's right oh yeah it looks like they've been oh they just like yeah I picture them I head to there's moments where it seems like they attempted it but dropped it several times like they tried to carry it and then at one point you come across a very smooshed rattling it's his head untucked he is flat like a pancake oh is it like roadkill cuz we get we get paid if we bring the hooded lanterns rattling heads it's just saying I mean they didn't pay they couldn't be flat rattling in yeah there was no I take the flat round head [Laughter] it looks like looking down at the smoosh rattling it looks like parts of him have been eaten as if the rattling might have cannibalize their own who's gonna carry the all the heads that we have to collect can I have a separate satchel for the heads and a big backpack I just don't want to get it mixed with my other stuff here you go just put it in your food pouch I carry the food pouch so okay I'll repurpose my food I will carry your head pouch yeah you can you can hang on to my rations dumping the move that'll go well every choice fine I do trust you there won't lose all of our ration yeah we all need to eat how far are we from the the mill as we've only a few more miles from here okay a short track will River be mad if there's rats there do we know that I mean oh God I mean they're all dead because and rivers just like got really a rat problem on I didn't think of that one but to be fair that might solve like a couple problems all the ones to bring back the heads and oh yeah no we need the rattling there are minions mean you see friends and I was like no minions servants I just continue down the road the fog begins to give away too and you see ahead of you surrounding the ruins of a farmhouse and past the dead horse of Dragon Jaime give it a good kick I can't get you can see a dozen soldiers in the street ahead several of them are jamming their weapons they're Howard's and Spears down into several corpses in the mud in front of them what what are they wearing what armor colors banners they're wearing the livery of Jupiter Jones JA you just scream that out uh yes yeah I did that I did but just I did the square root but uh scream that out and the men stopped there's about a dozen of them you can see coming from that group is the man himself Lord Jupiter Jones he steps forward wiping the blood off of his blade and he beams and smiles and he says well well Pluto Jackson come to survey the scene of my latest victory have you what did you kill your confidence nice nice Harold yeah you're non-confident jerk the the rest of his men begin to muster up including his gnomish Harold Flemington wit half and the heavily armoured half work bodyguard Bruce dead dog and as they assemble in front of you you can see that it's about a third of the number of men you encountered him with before you lose something Jupiter only a trail of a fantastic treasure indeed but the man needed to rest a moment while we certain drank in the Sucher of our most recent victory over these vile raff oh no oh yes we've been tracking a group of them dozens of them in fact they've been carrying some sort of strange Idol to one of their vile disgusting gods out into the hills no doubt to perform some sort of profane ritual we managed to isolate a few of them and cut them down the rats they are I myself slew ten of them my men not so many others but we've done well this day is a valiant fight we're still tracking them ourselves they've taken refuge in the hills over yonder Jupiter Jones first what pest control are you going to be trimming the hedges of Castle dragon I'm next well as you can see I brought some of my more recent recruits out with me and training them against these rat Phocas excellent to test their mettle for the horrors of the inner city I absolutely must thank you we found quite a bounty on our first four-way ray a great mountain of treasure indeed I sent you to the dragon or and you found it no we we didn't quite find it but we did find this Nobles mansion and the vaults were still intact and they had letters of credit mountains of gold it was incredible by Jove Jupiter that that's the hoard I sent you after well fantastic we have claimed it by caspia zhannar and in the name of house Jones that's fantastic we'll take our 25% then excuse me what we we sent you to retrieve that gold that was you were under our orders to find it ha ha ha and all the man burst out laughing and they continued to laugh oh you're not a man of honor I thought we had an agreement that you were gonna go retrieve that gold did we now I thought so do you happen to have it in writing there was a gentlemen's agreement but you're not much of a gentleman are you Jupiter straightens himself up and pulls up his armor and sheaths his blade crosses his arms and says a gentleman's honor is only due to a fellow gentleman and when I look at you I just see it cooker so I gave you the whereabouts of treasure you find it and you come back and insult me for leading you straight to it you did a fine job if you wish we'll buy you some beer next time we see you in ember wood village biggest beer on reverse it better be huge god damn it listen I mean that's all fine and dandy but I mean killing rattling - make your shoulders strong for the inner cities is child's play compared to what Pluto has been up to in the inner city yeah tellin Pluto yeah we I killed the cube and I killed some Knowles and some harpies and I got this wicked javelin and then I met with the commander and we put on a play and that's all royalty because as you would know if you were a noble part of your duties to represent caspia are to perform and to give fellow Caspian 50% of all treasure found that's part of international cast be a rule you would know you would know make a persuasion check 11:00 and by what force are you enforcing caspian law here in the lawless lands of mess Tamar you should titled Hill on to your dad yes that's right just run back to caspia and go in and tell all the other noble families that you ran headlong with your tail between your legs instead of Manning up and taking the treasures of the city for yourself in this place there are no rules there are no laws and there only the only spoils are those you can claim for yourself does that mean we can shoot him I am I turn I turn and I start I turn to face you so that my backs facing Jupiter and I just quietly I'm are you better than in I'm better than everyone okay okay are you better than him yes Jupiter you've done excellent work here slaying these helpless rattling and finding that treasure indeed we have and we've got more to track down you're wasting our time at this moment I thought we were under an agreement for part of the treasure Pluto seems to think that we were under an agreement for part of the treasure perhaps a wager is an order a contest a contest what do you have in mind well Pluto what are you best at tracking rattling [Music] that's what you want the contest yeah I bet we could find the routings before you do ha that's true probably our best three versus your best three well I challenge you then we shall go after our quarry and whichever man slays more rattling now shall be the winner of this contest not playing finding them he points to the deep groove in the in the road that is the the idol that they're dragging along with them I'm sure it's loaded with delirium and all sorts of other treasures and Pluto try again not and once we get there we have that if you think I'll even get you give you the first pass how does that sound you can go in on your own slay as many rattling x' as you think you can and once you've had your fill then I'll do it beat your number I'm sure you can't last as long against two of those and rattling zazz I can who don't have an idea do it I accept fantastic follow the trail we get a head start no funny business we will march along together where we go into the building first yes indeed we will follow the rattling x' and wherever we find them you can have your first you could have the first round ha ha you're going to need it ok team huddle he turns to his men come n there's more rattling x' to slay but you'll get another little bit of a rest before you get to sharpen your blades and test your mettle once again these fools want to have their little fun first the contest is to kill more rat the right folk than they do by the way what are the terms of the wager what what is what is at stake if we win you give us 50% of the treasure you found and whatever we find that they were drinking and whatever we find that we were dragging that they were dragging if we lose whatever they reject you get whatever they were dragging and this ring it's a magic ring I want the javelin if you don't wager the javelin nothing we'll go ahead and we'll take them on ourselves all right I pull out the javelin my heralded by Zeus that is a fine weapon I poured too we okay team huddle so that Jupiter can't hear team huddle we still have that flattened rat head yeah we need to kill more than he does if we can convince him to let us go in first we help the rat folk escape through like a back hole or something we even blow a back hole they all escape Jupiter walks in we throw the one rat head down and we say there was only one in here and we killed him that's more than you that's my plan that's a good plan we're gonna say alternatively I mean we can talk to the rat wounds or at least I can they talk talk then we can just convince them to like but what if Jupiter confirms I also got my plans your plan I was thinking we set up an ambush and help their hands attack maybe that's a little you don't feel like we want to kill the other class viens like we've been killing monsters we haven't really gotten into killin no I guess we killed some Queens man we ate fish people those are months I can't turn back now this is Who I am saying you're gonna look I'm just not saying I won't eat dude I haven't said that I don't want to but like alternatively we can just kill Groundlings I mean that's worst-case scenario okay during the group while I go on three we're gonna run do you want me to do you want me to mess yes we could run I can't make an illusion that big little ones Jupiter and his contingent are marching along oh wait up alongside Jupiter and his men you follow the trail of the rat links into the Charon hills along the muddy road and you come to an intersection in the roads there's a cops of trees some marshland several burnt-out and ruined farmhouses and ahead of you you can see in a low Hill the top of the low Hill are the burnt-out ruins of what might have been once a farmhouse or a small cottage and in the center of this farmhouse is an overturned wagon on a mound of dirt and poking out from inside some little windows that have been broken into the sides of the wagon Bailey you can see that there are roll rattling is pointing their crossbows out from underneath the the underneath the wagon and they are shooting their crossbows because lumbering towards carts and banging their fists against it are two truly massive creatures they are covered in thick knob knobby bits of flesh they're only wearing its a cloth and loincloth they had these large hooked noses and on the backs of their shoulders are actually bits of what looked like pieces of the meteoric iron and bits of delirium poking out of it their arms are long and lanky and covered in almost what looked like spines and claws that end and sharpened fingers and the two of them are kind of circling around it one of them is gnawing on half of a rattling as the other is kind of a circle the Wagen and once in a while one of the rattling shoots at one of the these big creatures and they Rumble backwards gluto you recognize these creatures there are trolls Jupiter I'd like to change our wager he says he's disgusting creatures you said we could have first run at them from rats to Charles forget the rats Jupiter we're after this this is a much worthier competition rats are nothing compared to this he he smiles and says all right Pluto you fought trolls you think you can take those two trolls by yourself do we like by himself or by ourselves he's a valiant warrior and monster slayer why does he need your help I thought this was a three versus three I need I just I need fire what leader goes on without their companions what what good is a leader without their men I can take those trolls by myself no sweat you know what I got a better how about whoever kills their troll first you get one he gets one you know what Jupiter I think you're right I think you could take both those trolls on by yourself I could and I could absolutely and I want to see it I also want to see it sure I'll see it you're going to give me the first crack at fighting these trolls absolutely you know what I just wish I was as strong and as capable of warriors you and hopefully I could learn something from way too fine Caspian leader you're pathetic you're already giving up you're conceding the field to me that's pathetic you're a coward you're just hoping that I'll get beaten up by those trolls so you can finish them off on your own you're hoping the same keys the trolls regenerate if you can't kill them they'll just heal themselves back up they'll be fine I suggest you go first and I cast suggestion okay make it and how are you going to conceal the trappings of casting the spell I have to do a verbal component which is beyond just hey I put my devil mask on and start mumbling underneath it okay you can make a deception check with disadvantage oh that's a nine as you begin honoring the incantations of the spell lemming tenue it half says are you trying to magic him up hmm you try to cheat by mine controlling him somehow why do you think he's got me around hmm oh I don't like you it's your nemesis lemming ttan he and let me listen I think the two of you should each take a troll on and we can all see which of you is truly stronger yeah yeah I can I can take a troll on yeah you can and when I win you're gonna give me half the treasure Jupiter or are you uh - I'm not afraid of fighting trolls one troll even easier than fighting - I would fight three trolls oh man so coool Rosa I do I don't show my I would like one stipulation [Music] if the battle gets too rough for both of you I'm not saying it will because you're both so amazing if it gets too rough and you both agree to have your friends join in both of you are allowed to have your comrades join we don't want anybody dying today mmm Inca restoration check that is 27 so be it but the first one to call for aid from their compatriots forfeits the match I agreed and I'm going to give a strong firm Caspian an ching okay that was a handshake so how will you approach the situation the Jupiter Jones steps forward he draws his blade eyes the trolls which are still several hundred feet away you can see them still beating down on thee on the cart they haven't caught sight of your groups yet how old to you he says to you well how are we going to separate them draw them off I'm gonna start walking towards them and they'll follow my lead all right light a torch and I'm going to start yelling out at the trolls cool so he's got this Hey hey you big dumb brutes all righty you cry out at them and they they turn up new rah and you hear what I say oi man flesh tastes like pork grog let's get him much better than these bony rattling and then is I'm assuming I'm on the left and Jackson's on my right yeah and I I just motion to Jackson you can take ugly and I'll take Harry wait wait I'm Jack so you're gonna fight Harry Harry and you're and he's gonna fight ugly yeah I glues on the right Harry's on the left fine try not to die too quickly hey it's same to you yeah he told me the same advice do you any other no lighter towards all righty remember that last time you kill the troll you've told me about it twelve times okay I'm so worried for you I can and everyone I will have you all row furnish it and I'll just kind of show it set up a little bit on our map Here I am pacing back and forth by the way I I'm gonna maybe try to interfere with them don't you cheat well I'm not because then he loses javelin not if he doesn't know I cheated well it's not him meaning - no it's the other one lemming Tanai you distract lemming Tinley me cast some spells I have spells that are not easy to notice yeah Bluto Jackson is well aware that he is under under-equipped but use your but I can't I can't not back down from do it for the rattling I'm doing it for the rattling we need them as servants River which one are you taking on the left one Harry the one on the left okay yes that's Jupiter Jones there's light chainmail armor and he's kind of got his dashing hair run running back his he's got those wide pampas sleeves as well over his chainmail armor okay so we will roll finished it you ah okay I'm just like I'm over the road we got who's first I got 18 whoo I got an 8 I got 11 lira Jackson's ready he's so ready user tablet I stab him so many times okay so going up first we're gonna have Pluto then Jupiter then Sebastian then the trolls then veo then Jupiter's men in case there's any interference okay Pluto you see the two trolls they're hulking forms lumbering towards you as the one troll finishes biting off the head of a rattling that he hadn't and swallows it down and yells out and says come on then Manning you taste like pork I'm gonna have bacon for the rest of the evening we're going to eat you all men oh and I understood all of that yeah yeah well I'm gonna throw a javelin at you and then I got a flank this way and I'm gonna do that and I Huck a javelin Adam and I get a 16 the javi you you're throwing lightning I know not yet okay the javelin soars forward striking the trolls soundly in the chest with a large with a deep like shock sort of noise that's what I wanted there's a question does the dueling add when I throw it no yes yes I think it might just be melee attacks we'll just say no cuz I don't need that help okay but it was five damage and I needed that help okay then what we do and then I'm gonna draw my sword and run at him okay and attack him again go for it the javelin flies back to your hand are you leaving it embedded in him oh yeah okay I'll get it I'll get it uh 25 oh yeah for 11 damage nice so as you rush up towards the troll you slice the front of it open and it reels back and just reaches out its hands and kind of tucks them back together like it's tucking it shirt back in didn't it itself already starting to regenerate damn anything else Pluto no that's everything okay Lord Jupiter Jones leaps forward his blade flashing in the air and as he he leaps forward he has his blade in one hand and a and a torch in the other and he takes the flashing blade and attacks the troll slicing deeply into it with with its with his sword and then bashing it with it with the torch looks like the troll takes about 20 points damage oh man he started doing so much better than me he's in the troll the troll good and just oh you got the you got the dumb one I want something in front of me troll okay Sebastian you're up see if this works I'm gonna grab Baio and I'm gonna point towards Jupiter and I'm gonna be like look at look at how awesome he's doing over there and well in pointing I'm going to cast mold earth to try to excavate the ground not excavate but move the ground underneath Jupiter's feet causing him to trip cool I'll give him a dexterity saving throw which he failed in fall and the earth kind of shakes and he slides to his feet and lands head against the stone wall in front of him and says oh this is muddy ground Pluto you've seized the better ground I think totally so I'm so hot and as he falls but he manages to keep his torch lit Pluto use fire fire fire fire good you're the one who's fought trolls okay the trolls go next the mighty troll in front of you lumbering snarls out brings his his claws down rakes them across you Pluto ow getting a 23 and a 10 to hit with the claws so the 23 hits the clock comes down and rents into your shoulder for 11 points of slashing damage and he pulls himself forward to bite at you getting a 13-2 hit that's a Miss and I'm gonna I'm gonna stab into his beauty beautiful mouth for a 24 to hit cool so as he comes down to bite you you just step in the blade goes right through through the the creatures mouth for how much damage 11 damage nice and you pull the blade back and its mouth is starting to stitch together a little bit you can see that it is clearly regenerating from the damage that you've dealt the other troll that has been damaged by Jupiter Jones does not its regeneration hindered by the burning flames of the torch nevertheless seeing fire is that what you meant it claws deeply into Jupiter Jones hitting him once twice before biting him in the shoulder and Jupiter and just savages Jupiter Jones who tries to parry Parry the blows but cannot Jupiter Jones takes a total of 29 points of damage whoo go Harry got no ugly go ugly go ugly you g/l why you ain't but you oddly okay Dale it's your turn okay there you can see that as the now that the fighting is started several the rattling czar poking their heads out from the heart to watch and you see you poking out his head is none other than the rat Prince and but I see him and I'm like okay you're not my first priority getting fired to Pluto is my first priority so I have a torch would I take an action to to light it you could light it and throw it towards pollute Oh as yeah as an action yes okay um I I do that I like the torch and it's a Pluto this and I tossed it at them okay make an acrobatics check now Pluto your hands are full so you got a tore your shield in one hand and your sword in another and you've spent your reaction so you're not gonna be able to grab this Turkey but it lands at your feet still lit it kind of lands and kind of knocks itself into the wooden fence sorry the stone fence okay sitting there perfectly jet but sitting there gently and then still gesturing to the rapper and like inside the thing okay now we go to Jupiter's men lemming ttan uh sees that it sees the torch and he casts mage hand and grabs the torch and moves it to the to the other side of the hill of the and then and then he turns to you and says and he sticks his tongue out no cheating and he turns back to pollute oh and yells out Bluto you smell really awful and you're going to die make it charisma saving oh yeah he's cheating fifteen okay you managed to resist lemming Tain's taunts you will not have disadvantage on attack girls for that your next turn yes but the torch is now not where it needs to be the torch is now on the other side of the fence right there okay okay [Music] okay you go to the top of the round with pollute oh um following vales lead I have my own aha moment and I throw my sword to the ground and I'm gonna pull out a torch okay pull out the torch it's not lit I light it okay that will be in action to light the torch and then can I still hit him with it or no you got a light the torch okay I'm going to light the torch okay and then I'm going to shield slam the troll onto the ground oh wait now thank you did you get Riggin I'm going to light the torch okay you let your torch of that okay your sword is on the ground you lit the torch oh wait then I'm gonna action surge then I'm gonna start whaling on nice okay so the torch doesn't improvise a weapon that does 1 d6 fire oh that does one d4 fire damage plus your strength mod here we go here we go here we go and I go you don't add your proficiency modifier to the attack Robo with it I'm gonna light him up well I miss I get a a 9 - so you lighting up the torch and action surging you swipe the torch towards the troll who leaps backwards with unerring dexterity and then I'm gonna swing at him again okay and I got a swing at him for a Miss so you're kind of like the troll is seeing the torch waving out is like ah sir I need this kind of stack like keeping him back yeah okay yeah Jupiter Jones gets to his feet terrible Pat's himself off looks it looks at his wounds he fights himself to it to his feet and begins attacking the troll again slicing with his longsword he manages to hit the troll only once and then he tries to swipe with his torch and misses wide so he lunges forward to his feet stabs the troll whoo-hoo-hoo pushes him backwards as he tries to hit the troll with his torch but misses with the attack the troll only takes eight points of damage and will probably regenerate monster Sebastian you're up oh man where's a lemming ttan lemmings are right beside you it's a load of me I turned a lemming 10 and I'm like I thought you said no cheating it's not cheating to cheer for your career the winning team or insult the losers you cast a spell cast a spell to move the torch that she threw is a cheater okay so the rules are no interfering with their battle clearly but those rules have been clearly broken now I cast web and I SAT through and you web him I will say well what you went him to the rocks and and the men in Bruges dead dog are like that's uncalled for he's not injured we're just making sure there's no interference he'll be fine make a persuasion check that is 17 Bruce Ted Doc Morris his are his weapons and says can you at least make sure some of the webs cover his mouth so he shuts up in five minutes yes and the mega they are they get it okay nice we go now to the trolls the first troll hammers away at pollute oh it moves to attack you pollute oh and as you wave the torches in front of it it kind of waves its arms back at you and it wants to approach to attack you but as you're waving the torch in front of it it's just - it's almost terrified of the flame yeah and it doesn't manage to land a single blow the oh the only attack that comes in you're able to push a side with your shield and I'm going to repost it with my torch you're gonna try to while he's distracted hit him with the old 15 that hits four oh wait sorry a 1-point of fire damage and lost her mod yeah 11 point oh so five points of damage okay with the torch and eleven with with the rest of just regular damage okay so that tax forward you're able to smash it in the wounds that you inflicted before inhibiting its regeneration for this turn yeah as well and getting some damage on the board the other troll rips into Jupiter Jones scoring another pair of hits with its claws as it slashes into Jupiter Jones he takes another 22 points of damage oh he's bloodied oh oh all uh all finesse no no shields there a Jupiter he battered Jupiter looked looks back to her chances I've got this under control it's fine it's fine don't let your pride get in the way you can yield at any time it grits his teeth next up that was the troll so we've got Vale is the rapper instill in view or did he go hide um make a perception jacket sixty the rat prince has clambered out of the wagon and is in the it's has managed to sneak over to the trees and is slowly slinking away and and czc and I I do the same and I say and I kind of motion to erm I'm like you and I point to the troll for Pluto and then I point to the other troll and I say no pew pew pew pew do you then the rat print sees you pointing and then point at the other people you and I point again to the the big troll near Pluto and he tries to mine back at you any mines like the stitching motion and like he points at the trolls of Mines of stitching motion points at the humans and then my mines up no and I and I shout I just say your ghost command you make the shooting motion towards the troll ok make an intimidation check with advantage so you scream out and the rat prince dives down into the brushes but seeing that all of Jupiter Jones's men go they all kind of everyone simultaneously looks she speaks to ghosts just like don't worry about me I'm just hungry ok this is what happens when I'm nervous and I'm hungry I just have words words what else would you like to do hey I I'm gonna ready in action with my crossbow that if any of the men start advancing behind me in a menacing way I want to be ready with it I'm just like I don't trust these guys ok Jupiter Jones's men just look at you and they and lamingtons in the in the webs kind of ensnared and he tries to break his way out and he gets a 12 on the strength check and you can hear him underneath underneath muffled voice you can hear him saying uttering a string of profanities and we go to the top of the round with pollute oh alright so I I hit him with some fire mm-hmm this is what I want to do I want to drop the torch I want to pull the javelin out ooh and then jam it back in cool go for it 19 you got it so you rush up to the troll as he's backing away from the torches and throw the torch on the ground in front of him leap forward grab the javelin pull it out and stab it back into him for 8 no 7 damage okay and then what and then I'm gonna stab him with it again okay go for it actually this time no this time I want to take I want to I want to step back 5 feet I'm gonna let him take a swing at me okay so you step out of his area he swipes at you getting a 16 to hit Miss so I duck out of the way and then I'm gonna lightning throw the javelin at it right like almost point down skid getting a 18 to hit he utterly fails his dexterity saving throws well against the lightning and I go Harry I'm gonna make your hair stand on end that's pretty good right 5 out of 10 6 I got probably now yeah we hold up the side [Laughter] 20 so here's what here's what I imagine you throw the torch on the ground in front of the troll sleep forward on to pull the javelin back stab it into him really quickly and Porcia throw the javelin in midair yeah and just with a thunderous bolt like oh this bolt of lightning strikes the troll for how much damage total uh twenty pretty weak but that leaves the troll bloodied yeah anything else Bluto and then I retrieved the job its way out nice yeah alrighty javelin in hand we go - oh wait can I ask one thing yeah sorry I can still shield slam them and stuff right you'd have to move right up back up I'm gonna run back up to him I'm gonna hit him okay go for it nineteen he's knocked on his feet yeah and I'm gonna stand over him nice menacingly nice like I'm gonna finish off the troll okay Jupiter Jones who three doubles his redoubling his attack against the troll launches into a cavalcade of attacks but only hits with his long sword attack and again misses with the torch so he stabs forward and the troll dives out of the way as the torch comes down to where its head was so he only inflicts eight damage on the throne yeah yeah you have you got you got at you and we go to Sebastian sebastian starts turns to vale as if he's talking to her and is just like starts mumbling stuff about the torch and a little mage hand appears and takes Pluto's torch that he had thrown on the ground and just sticks it into the troll a little bit most of the men are looking at veo like she's crazy and have taken their eyes off the fight for a brief moment if you make a deception check you'll be able to move the torch unnoticed it was not the most magical 15 seems like no one saw you move the torch back over and you drop it right beside the troll can it like be touching the trolls so that he's kind of singed just a little sure make an attack roll oh your spell-casting ability modifiers 21 so you may lift the torch out with mage hand and drop it on the troll and it lands at its face I'm gonna say it feels one point of fire damage to the troll but that's enough to cut off its regeneration yeah cool anything else a bastion I look over at LEM and I wink remington definitely saw that happen he's like [Laughter] next up are the trolls the trolls know your troll scampers to his feet and cries out I'm gonna kill you manling oh and manages to land one attack with a 22 to hit I accept I accept the trolls fist as it comes up from the ground Wallops you in the face for 12 points of damage and again I'm going to repost his other attacks cool at 16 to hit it hits for 12 damage but the old stabby spear stabby and see how much damage I take 12 yourself the other troll rips into Pluto Pluto's friend and rival Jupiter Jones we have an on-off relationship and doesn't land a single hit Jupiter Jones deftly dodges each incoming wallop flecks of dirt fly up around him as he spins around you gotta bail so at this point I know I probably can't get away with anything without them seeing so I figure I can try to distract them more so I turn around with crossbow in hand start waving it around being like well it's about time that your guy got into it and I start getting up in the big guy's face waving my crossbow around like I don't know why you're following this clown cuz obviously we can see who the better fighter is here and I just try to get as much attention from them as I can okay the make a performance Jack woo but on your Friar Tuck hat he said firetruck for four they look at you and they say she's been touched by the Delirium she's gone bonkers and they focused back on the they turned the he kind of pushes you aside and says out of my way cat gotta keep an eye on Jupiter Jones good try read in the men cry looking at seeing Jupiter Jones situation they say Lord Jones shall we intervene and Jupiter Jones says no no I've got it I've got this it's fine it's fine everything's fine situation normal let me go to the top of the round the pool I'm gonna I'm gonna keep stabbing I pull my after the last attack a man into his like leg or something so I pull it out and I go to just keep driving at home I'm not gonna let this guy cool this troll live another moment 22 for 8 damage you bury it in its leg and it falls to its knees it's still alive and then I'm gonna remove the spear and try to go for what I believe is the finishing blow okay but it might not be but time will tell doo-doo-doo-doo to do 15 that hits for 10 damage so you swipe wide with the spear decapitating the troll with the broad head of the spear yeah the the head falls to the ground but the body's still moving and reaching at the head and now starts looking for where the head is on the ground controls like you fool this last time this habit it took us two weeks to find that and to get it me reattached anything else you'd like to do I want a bonus shove the body away from the head okay do I get advantage cuz he has no head it would be actually easier to kick the head away from the body okay okay yeah you can I just do that yeah I just boot the head at Jupiter okay I give him I go here's a little present for you all right you said you could make a strange check 17 so basically you kind of fun using your shield you punt the trolls head actually here's what I imagine you slice through the trolls neck and then you take the side of your shield to T it off and it flies and lands a rate past Jupiter Jones and the trolls body is like moving towards it but it's still very much alive and so as the head is the head continues to scream at the body it is now over to 2 Peter Jones Jupiter Jones seeing the head land on the ground in in front of it he and seeing the troll in front of him says what are you giving it me two trolls to kill I've got my hands full over here idiot and he attacks the troll only landing one hit just with his torch this time ooh his troll is bloodied but so is he you go to Sebastian I I turn around and I say this is really an opportune time but I have to go peepee and I walk over to the bushes and I turn back to them again and I go well don't look make it deception check with their their like why aren't you going over to the trees that's more private there I don't want to walk that far hey do it bandage 13 they say well whip it out then let's see you gonna pee all in front of us and they're the troll says I thought the only pissing match was between Jones and Jackson up over there all right fine I'm going somewhere more private and I go and I start peeing on lemon said that under my arm I'm going to shoot a fire bolt at the trolls body do you think could I do that without being noticed not a chance not a chance okay I'm gonna try to mage hand the torch again okay the torch is over by the trolls but is basically like in the troll space go so you've walked over you are actually relieving yourself yeah sure okay you can control your mage hand with a bonus action so that's it's fine go for it another attack roll with it or yeah yeah you want to go for the trolls body yeah I'm just gonna like grab the torch and I know that like I know that mage hand can't be used to cause damage but you can pick it up and drop it and pick up a flaming torch and I can and I can do it too if you want if you want me to just like move the torch into your hands leave it in your hand under my arm yeah or do it no I'll try it I'll try to drop it on it okay I got an 18 the torch lands in the trolls space but the trolls body you should avoid it yeah Oh Pluto and I finish peeing on lemming okay we go to the trolls the troll the trolls body regenerates a little bit and you can see like this kind of secondary head starting to grow on it and but it the body like starts walking towards where you kick the head of its head and it provokes an opportunity attack and I try to nail it to the ground okay I only got a 9 miss as you swipe it I swipe away from it it walks back towards it continues walking towards where its head is and tries to pick it up and is putting it back on its back on no and its surrounding Jupiter Jones and as the head kind of falls back into place it looks it looks down and says and sees Jupiter Jones in front of it and it looks like the troll is gonna go like both the trolls you know attacked Koopa to drop the other troll presses his attack against Jupiter scoring three hits oh no and it picks Jupiter Jones up bites deeply into him and throws him against the ground and Jupiter Jones Landes unconscious and dying on the ground and the men gasp we go to the Tata to now they are I think we won we just saved Jupiter yeah I actually run using my feline agility over to Jupiter and give him a help okay actually no I heal them like my healers good okay go for it the check is automatically successful so you stabilize him move the other troll right over by him as well the truth the two trolls see this and they're like boy it's a in a game anymore let's just kill them all okay Jupiter's men they rush forward as well towards the trolls Oh let's get them save them our Lord they all yell out oh no Jupiter top of the round with Pluto the the sportsmanship of the game starts to become pale in comparison to the danger that we now face and I'm gonna stick the spear in the ground I'm gonna pick up the torch I'm gonna run and stab the troll that I'd beheaded in the back ok go for it of the back 17 that is a hit for oh wait now we're on a stick back of the back hold back back in the back eight damage alrighty give me one more good hit daddy wants for seventeen how do you care Serena it would have been 15 how do you slay this troll I slay this troll by Reidy Kappa Tatum with a torch so the head is trying to stick back on so yeah the trolls head up and then light the light the stump on fire it's separating a pancake that's not quite together like our eggs in a pan like you know how like they start trying together you can just run it quickly through it yeah yeah they're trying to get together and the troll falls to the ground stone dead and then I'm going to rush the other troll and slam him with my knight my shield biggest rancor 21 you pushed the troll away from Jupiter Jones and I'm gonna stand in between Nitro and Jupiter Jupiter Jones is Dazed and Confused he's stabilized because you stabilize with a kit so next we go to Sebastian first of all I stop concentrating on Webb and I'm they'll and you might want to help out and then I walk over here and I'm just going to scorching ray that troll okay go for it nineteen hits 15 hits 19 all three hit Oh baby ooh baby I love the way sixteen 22 with a barrage of fiery beams you ventilate the troll leaving behind a burning and searing mass of flesh that does not regenerate hey Pluto remember that time I killed a troll I saw that I was right here so now we're to two to one yes Jupiter's men gather the half-orc bodyguard says let me see him let me see him and he Jupiter Jones is completely unconscious but he's stable he sees that he's alive he's alive and the the orc says you saved his life that's my bodyguard right there that's what we do which guards the bodies they they Livington says she's really good Livington Watt walks forward wringing out his coat says you what are we gonna you guys these guys just peed on me and they totally cheated are you just gonna let them like walk all over us because they saved Jupiter Jones he got himself into the situation and I got peed on it should be noted that I cast as many spells as you did so and you were on the p-n Rock I don't like you I hope you die in the ruins and a fire noted we'll see who dies first lamb yeah mmm listen you guys we need to get food get Jupiter and just get out of here leave these guys are jerks uh we had a deal deal's off you peed on me that wasn't part of the deal that has nothing to do with it but man kind of shuffle back and forth they are really sure what to make of this situation listen I think if Jupiter was awake right now he would honor the agreement that we made and I can wake him up we have potions that can heal him so I mean do you want me to wake him up right now Cass be an honor do you men you Caspian men have any shred of dignity left in Drakon Heim this is all that separates us between us and the monsters that inhabit this great land I and I Jim I torch a little more into the dead troll Sebastian you wanna add anything we were promised 50% and we intervened both parties intervened in this situation an equal amount meaning it was still a fair game and fair game means that I believe Jupiter Jones a man who says he's of honor and loyalty would uphold his end of the bargain you can all make a persuasion check with advantage 19:25 aid bolstered by your compatriots words the Caspian my Herald the the Caspian Stern and the half [ __ ] bruce says lem this is Caspian honor they did right by our Lord let's take him back to member wood village and give them their due this Mound these rattling x' you can claim the spoils whatever they've got under there I'm sure you're capable of it and he says men turn it over and they open up a one of their packs that they've had have assembled loot and they turn it on and they drop it on the ground as they turn to leave and they as they and then they pick up Jupiter Jones and start hauling them and prepare to haul them off you you've done Caspi a great honour today Bruce and and gold is gold but blood is thicker than gold when it's frozen and you're a strong warrior you Casper might not be the smartest one but I've seen many men fight trolls before you did a great job I thought thank you LEM has to Jupiter 2 and lemming didn't speaks back up and says this isn't over you know when Jupiter Jones wakes up he's gonna be so mad and he's gonna want revenge on you all I just know it we'll see you in amber wood village and it's not gonna be pretty we're gonna get that gold back and then the rest of the Caspian is kind of shrug at that Len and one of them kicks him in the ribs as they turn to leave because he smells like pee I turn you guys well cover me in deep-fried batter and call me tempura I did not expect that anything good job Bluto guys the trick was firing did you know that yeah I just started to walk away I'm like Pluto Pluto you fought Charles before okay full disclosure nice let me kill the troll he fell into fire as the caspian uns walk away the rattling 'he's come out of there hubble hole and the rat princess oh angry ghost you save us again from big lawful trolls and scary ugly then I go up to him and I kick him in the face on the troll oh I thought we we have many many down there when you killed rose we thought oh yes is yes we kill men we eat them yes yes yes they tasty no man flesh tastier than anything else in city rat Prince if you get the chance I give you permission to eat lemming ttan a little Oh No very very good no the other he's like a chicken but I've got him you could have got him next time we'll get you an opportunity I was the rat poop uu pew pew we need to come up with ones for the rat rat prints we do and we need like a pork chops for a reference yeah it's pew pew as the the rattling it looks like the rattling is dug an impromptu little hole to hide in as in a clown car like fashioned about three dozen rattling scum out from under the hole under the cart they dug it an impromptu burrow and they bring out the shower the the piece of the meteor as well is it big they it is covered in mud they have been dragging it some way and trying to push it but they've done a good job of this and the rattling and without the rattling x' and the rest of you begin making your way towards the mill but before we delve into the ruins a big thank you to accent shield for providing us with the awesome gaming accessories you have seen us using like this beautiful initiative trackers and that's spun around perfectly and also for a tabletop audio for the great ambient music you're listening to yeah we got a new mix tonight I really was trawling through tabletop audios newest tracks so there's some new songs in here hopefully they are a nice mix where the atmosphere will keep trying to bolster that up and get a nice a nice list of music happening and finally two hundred years bore for the amazing voice work he does in our intro video and also if you are enjoying the show and you want to help support us you can check out our patreon at patreon.com slash dungeon underscore dudes yeah a lot of our patrons really love our patreon because great way to get in touch with us a bunch of our patrons have asked us for extra help with play a new player advice builds for their characters and such and so forth so if you're interested in engaging with us one on one like if you've got questions about how to run your campaign or how to create your characters and talking to us through patreon is one of the best ways to ask those questions before the break we had a bit of a challenge between Polito Jackson and Jupiter Jones where the pair of them were dueling a pair of trolls hairy and ugly as they were nicknamed in front of an overturned wagon where the rat prince and the other rattling had hidden themselves in the battle Jupiter Jones was defeated by the troll and the rest of you came to the rescue of Lord Jupiter Jones not leaving him to die to his fate but rather they owed Ashtyn to save him stabilizing with a healer's kit you managed to convince the rest of his his soldiers to leave peacefully as they drop off several of the spoils that they had found in the city as payment for saving Jupiter Jones and not leaving him to the fate of the troll all in all in across the bags they have found several several bags of gold but also several gems and by and large a lot of it appears to be loot like precious plates of silver golden candelabras a few tapestries as well that they've looted from the ruins in addition to a fair amount amount of gold all set is about 250 gold pieces in coins but the remaining objects that they have left are probably with another 500 pieces you give that chance to the commander of the hood and lanterns you can have a bunch of silverware or we could give it to the guy in number wood village and he can sell it oh yeah yeah guys technically we didn't find this within the city walls yeah oh yeah you know what I'm really glad I have my my tax experts with me you guys are my H&R Block also they've left the trolls which have bits of delirium growing out of there I'm prying nose oh yeah it's let's do some surgery um you are able to cut into their flesh and harvest six small shards of delirium I'm gonna be a butcher chunk I'll take a long I'm gonna be the buns the references you can do oh yes we eat roll now yes yes eat eat eat it's all yours the rat links cassoulet oh and they and they start going as Baio finishes extracting the Delirium the rattling x' begin hacking off the burnt limbs of the troll and several of the rattling starts singing like oh we love to cook our meat we love to have our dinner and the rattling is like their eyes oh oh so rare we don't cook our meat very often is nice and tasty crispy you guys are just so he still tasty trolls question for you rat Prince regarding this giant chunk of meteor oh yes we have brought it for you yes yes yes yes I managed to sneak my way out find the other rats they bring it they had many many problems without me and one of them fell on my good friend heal he was squish we ate him yes yes yes yeah I we we saw did you think that maybe if you were able to break the rock into smaller pieces it might be easier to carry the rattling so I'll just kind of look at you blankly no no no no no we push much we pull we push we Poli push me pull is okay there's many of us yes I says just many hands make light work there could you guys I guess you want they want to build it into a statue don't think I was gonna say if you wanted to you could build it you could break it into smaller pieces and we could help you carry well being that you were the apprentice for your dad right would would he benefit from if it was broken down or does he want one big chunk no take longer to heat up so probably smaller to do it's probably gonna have to melt it down and break it up anyway yeah but it might be hard you'll need tools to break it apart yeah that's why I was gonna make the rats do it chew it chew it aha oh just chew it into pieces I don't know if their teeth would survive that nevertheless the rattling 's have developed a methodology for carrying this thing with basically several of them they pull out several ropes and bits of timber and wood and they basically roll it forward on a few logs here and there pulling it with some ropes it's very haphazard they change methods it seems to be the meandering path of like sometimes they roll it across some logs sometimes they all try to lift it up and carry it and Natalie dropping it sometimes they push it sometimes they pull it but after a little while we can help you can help and you're able to bring the this big piece of New York Rock up to the Eckerman mill great now we have to get it all the way yeah you know a rough River know how to break it up easier maybe she's magic who's asking thanks rats yeah so you've arrived once again at the Ackerman mill the campsite that has been shared among several other adventures still leaving the embers of whichever group was camped out here last and as you step inside the dank and creaky old wooden mill or the windows kind of turning with loud creaking even though the machinery inside is broken you can see that there are a few more names scrawled on and scrawled off the walls of the Ackermann no we almost got this scratched Jupiter's an office Elizabeth I'm gonna add RP to our list for reference yeah he's but I also don't want to just give away that we're hanging out with a rapper itself we're gonna call our Pete the rattling z' all swarm inside the mill and go this very nice place yes yes very cozy make it like a home yeah I guess you could have this be your winter home mmm it's not safe we have to dig underneath start to build a can you build a tunnel oh we try we try we try digging under the city yes yes yes yeah but you have to take very very deep the rock very very thick very very tough too hard for our small hands Asus's hmm maybe we could get them excavating tools what if we got the rat print each them to mine and start a Molly in this room we could like give them like little pickaxes and stuff made of this meteorite make it like chip through yeah because then we'd have a direct way into the city this is a nine year project it's gonna cost 7,000 Delirium well at least you the borough a little hole underneath even if it's not connected to the city feel free as long as you don't collapse the building Oh the the rattling z' roughly 40 there there's almost 40 of them but it's all set including the right prints that have all now assembled in the mill of varying sizes maybe only about a dozen of them are fully bipedal the rest of them are small rat smaller rats that clamor forth and forward the rat prints by comparison is gigantic compared to the other rat wings the rattling 'he's having delivered the meteor piece here the rat prince asks all costs why who come out of the city so soon what you do next well I mean we for now finished when we need to in the city doesn't mean we're not gonna come back and visit but we we have some business to take care of oh yes yes do you know and the great rat God will come for us this is this is a phase one of a multi-phase unknown ending phase cycle we're aiming for a year but it could be longer Oh much waiting much waiting we all need to eat many more meals before then yes and not anger the heralds of the rat God oh you save us from trolls you save us from ends we owe you much much much ghosts all ghosts you do not worry we not try to shoot you in the back like polo trick we think about it but no remember no no we're not angry at God good I wouldn't shoot us from this is really bad this is weird but we also this meteorite we need to kind of go the other way you wouldn't want to keep dragging this thing look like like pulling out our trusty map their biggest issue is that you got to get this thing across the river if you want to get it back to Everwood that's why I figured it was safe here for now for now because like it's so hard to move that it's not even like it's not even a fun thing to try to steal so it's just gonna sit here until we figure out what to do with it could we potentially bring your dad over here to help break it down potentially or yeah or we could figure out how to break it down maybe you can tell us and then we could that's one one during a braver might have a yeah that's worth asking the rattling 's have consumed what remains of the trolls that's satisfy them it did and the rat prince turns to you about are you all and say if you you still need us we stay we try not to go too far outside the city the clean air hurt our lungs yes yes yes I think you're good to go home yeah yes you've done such great work your services are very appreciated the gods will be pleased you staying in that tower yes the clicky clock rock tower yes is yes that's a base of operations for us now yeah with the fishes are the fishes are below okay you know where you find me you need me again yes yes yes yes yes okay okay bye for now bye my prince assembles the rattling who squeaking and marching scurry back into the ruins of the city and such a good minion they're really like they're really loyal yeah I missed that loyalty amongst servants loyal now they do believe that we represent their God it's not like we couldn't wipe them out but we don't want to they're our friends could dare I say friends I've had very few close friends in my life and sadly I think the rat prince is in the top and references made top ten for us I only have two upper slots for friends and you guys so far have that oh I mean River was my best childhood friend but reference seems to be nicer to me than she thinks well let her hear he's saying that without standing right behind you with that short time passes before the familiar footsteps of rivers Guardian can be heard in the distance that should end it is then that you see wherever approaching as always she is has her hood the purple hood of the amethyst Academy drawn up over her face and she walks forward protected by that strange full plate armor guardian who carries a shield and a flaming sword whose face you cannot see beneath the visor she walks forward and as she catches sight of you she holds her hood back you can see River with her dark red already brown mottled skin and her flowing blue hair that with her horns twisted back like a pair of boats floating in her hat in her hair the kind of spectacles she kind of pushes her spectacles back up over her brow she dressed her hood and she's kind of got that short kind of riding leathers that she's wearing most of the mages the amethyst Academy you got to be an old professor to wear robes like a classic wizard in the Academy she pulls her hood down and says right on time I there was a bunch of rattling coming this way I was scared to approach what was that new friends seriously we work with what we can in dragon hood how did you manage that they they believe that were the heralds of their God it's a long story but we we did some convincing you know superstition smart there's a lot of it in the city and you can get a long way when people don't know what you're capable of well you know me I like I like to find ways to convince people to do things well how do things go excellent actually I it's been a while yes it has you sent us to investigate Oscar yeah that was almost a week ago yeah we have a long week actually probably longer than that now that I think about I know I think you spent like 2 or 3 days a number with village and another 2 or 3 days yeah probably maybe almost 2 weeks yeah never even we've been trying we've been trying to find her way through the city yeah there's been a lot going on but we did get a lot of great information from from Oscar and what happened I mean I'd like to know the full report we uh we left him alive because ok ventures are armed interestingly enough the work that he's doing could be extremely valuable and once again my instinct to try to manipulate everybody I talk to that's not a good thing I think that we can use him he doesn't want to work for you but he doesn't know that the information he gives me comes back to you that might be useful where's his research he's informed me of what he's working on and I've taken notes here's my notes he's working on a resistance to the Hanes he has the ability himself to drink delirium to be able to cast more spells he's using a plant in Queens Park Gardens called the eldritch lilies and he's noted that delirium grows more like a plant specifically a fungus it takes a very long time to grow but that's why there seems to be more delirium than there was when it first hit this is fascinating news did you manage to steal or secure any of his actual researcher notes we felt bad about hurting a nerd we never we he needed his research to continue and his research is incomplete it's not full yet and we think he can do more good for the emphasis Academy if we can get him to complete his research and then we could steal I need a more at a hundred percent she sighs we need something tangible you can take my notes we can get you those are you I appreciate them but right now you're just giving me your word on what you've learned from him for all you know he could have been lying to you well I mean he also took my blood to experiment what oh so we were supposed to do that we're working he's working with great you ate the backseat blood to see if there's a resistance listen if Oscar urine has developed something with Tabac see blood or the Eldridge Louise or has figured out anything with delirium we need to know exactly where his research is at and we need his research itself so we can study it whatever he's figured out whatever he's learned is secondary to whatever he might might learn at this point we care more about what he's done not what he's doing she turns to her compatriot and has him produced his backpack out of which she pulls a glowing purple vial we've already developed a way to drink delirium yeah had yeah that would have been nice to know before we went in there and I was very excited by this news the whole basis on me keeping him alive and letting him continue his research was based on that well things are on a need-to-know basis and straight up the Academy didn't want me to let it and let you know about this until you'd come back successfully with more information it's because of my delirium have it I used to have can't let him near it because crazy like cabinet listen this puts us behind now we were expecting to have the have this more information so we can start planning our next steps but look if Oscar urine thinks he can develop some sort of resistance the haze or anywhere that we can get deeper into the city that's amazing we need to know that because the Academy actually has the resources that if he's found anything we can make it reality he's working in a little lab with whatever resources he can scrounge together and you want to work with him when we have the resources the of the entire Academy in our disposal the research his ideas were what we need to jumpstart our work I'm sorry but you haven't really done the job guys hmm maybe we can get you some eldritch Lily's and show you what they do that may be so but if it could be for all we know Oscar yarn was lying to you and telling you whatever he needed to know to get rid of you you left him alive who's to say if he wasn't lying who's to say even if anything what he said a delirium growing if that's actual fact without his research notes without us being able to study them directly we've got nothing can we get a team huddle real quick if there's anything that you need to talk about you can talk about it with me it's embarrassing I have a bladder fine I'll give you a moment and I'm gonna try to contact one of my superiors Thank You River who - I didn't know you had a bladder problem okay you know what it's don't worry about it um we did we screw up I've I've never been told I didn't complete a mission from the amethyst Academy I thought that I have I think we need to compartmentalize going forward should I have should I have killed him yeah I felt bad about I still feel like we made the right decision based on what we had um language I've always done what River asked me to maybe we got to go back and get maybe we got to go shake him down again yeah let's go I think we should piss really good and I hope he's still in the same place you will be well how else are we gonna get him to back see blood he needs me he needs you you need your blood but we need to figure out how the eldritch Lilly's work if what he's saying is true and we have to bring some hard evidence to Lille if not research papers then probably something that they can work with okay and then but yeah I do I request I to have a bladder problem I just want to just can I do thanks for actually worried worrying about them as you turn back to River well we'll look into securing the actual notes that Oscar possesses and I'm sorry I let you down River listen at the stage things are moving forward I need to meet Elgar again or in Everwood village tomorrow oh we were gonna be on our way there actually could you you you don't happen to know a good way to carry a meteorite you happen to know how to she kind of talks her head what I don't get her mental lies I need to get this meteorite to amberwood village can you help me her eyes go wide when she looks that that's a piece of the meteor yeah by the way can I have one of those potions oh we brought you more delirium see now we're trading in sighs and she has a compass um she she kind of smiles that creepy smile that she has that work you can just see how sharp her teeth are a little bit too much and she says I am applaud your enthusiasm it looks like you've done some great things in the meantime I can help you get this meteor to Amber what village I don't know what you want to do with it it's iron it's great she's right delirium we can work out a deal with Eldrick when he gets here but we have to decide what our next steps are because I can't in good conscience send you back into the city and going after Oscar urine and how we know for sure that he's not on to us because the stage whom our cover could be completely blown to I don't think that reckless personally but well I mean that's fair way if you can help us with this meteor chunk will you let us know if there's more work that we can do will do better you know my track record with the amethyst Academy I'm sorry about this one mishap this is disappointing we've been really vouching for you but we wanted more at this time I guess maybe you want the next time we need someone killed we should come to you but I thought you were gonna be capable of handling something a little more delicate this time well we have a day right you meet Eldrick tomorrow if you get the meteorite back to ember wood we'll get information from Oscar and we'll meet you in Everwood village didn't you just say not to do that she doesn't want us going after Oscar right now because he might be on to us but she wants whether he knows we do but we're gonna have to plan that step carefully now I mean he trusts us yeah he loves us we're like buds I'm conflicted she says I am as well to be perfectly honest in my in my estimation what we can get from Oscar yarn right now keeping your position with him yes maybe he's found out some more things yes maybe his information is still valuable yes maybe we should play that ruse a little bit more and directly stealing from him or killing him and taking his notes maybe that's not well not the play that we want to do right now that was my thoughts needs tell us you need to make a judgment call and figure this out because if you're disappointed we don't have the information we're willing to go and get it if you want us to keep playing this ruse we'll keep playing the roots right now or if you want us to it until you give us the word to go ahead we can do that as well what if we go grab the elders lilies yeah and then meet Oscar to push the push it forward cuz that's what he needs right yeah so we can help him with his research but that's if the amethyst Academy wants us to do that so amethyst Academy what do you want us to do I think that the prospect of getting some elders lilies and getting him to synthesize whatever potion he thinks is working might prove useful if he can make one of these potions for us and you can bring it back to us we could reverse engineer it and he wouldn't know that we've taken any we think we kind of nailed it we'll bring you a synthesized potion or a potion and we'll bring some eldritch to the woods yeah do you have those we've had samples of them in the past but they came in years and years ago very few people have been able to make it into the inner city are you confident that you're gonna be able to get there you've been by there already but we're not by Queens Park Garden but we've been in and out of the city you've been in and out of the inner part of the city yeah how did you arrange that we worked our way in that remember the fun well you didn't tell me that that's a huge development have you been anywhere near the tower yes not yet no do you want us to do that yeah Oh new mission this is good news you should have told me this before that you'd actually made it inside the city we're so focused on Oscar failure how did you do that through the sewers using the rat folk like I said we made new friends okay maybe I shouldn't have doubted you quite so quickly you messed up with Oscar yarn but this is an amazing development we're not disappointment we're not disappoint all right we'd share the prospect of not disappointing River so you'd River used to do the craziest magic together and all sorts of shenanigans and now she is judging me based on my antics look at I'm just glad that you're you seem to be making more friends than enemies at this stage you're right they do I do have a tendency to cause okay here's what I think we can agree on I'm going to make back make my way to Everwood village where I'm going to meet with Eldrick mage guild is getting ready to make our move that's all I know at this stage but there's a lot more people that are taking an interest in the city over the past few weeks I'm gonna make my way there and I'll meet you there you go get these Eldridge lilies bring them to Oscar yarn get him to do his work whatever you need to do whatever he needs you to do to get this potion of his done and finished do it once you once he has the potion finished we need a complete dose and sample of it so if you have to if he only makes one and he's not gonna give it to you kill him and get it and then take all his research at this stage that's enough of that enough value for Oscar yarn to buy his life for a little bit longer to get everything that all of his research once he's made that potion he's not of any use to us anymore alive so I leave it up to you what you want to do from work okay good I think we can work with those instructions you know yeah I'm on board I was just thinking about the cat's blood but I don't know why that's the I was like your blood I don't know just a thought I had what's up River make sure he doesn't lie to you or try to trick you he might say or do anything and be banking on the fact that you don't understand the details of his research to try to get you to get away he thinks that you might just be interested in something that's fine especially with these potions [Music] she stops her selfies from you have to make sure the potion works oh yeah so then we need to you need enough to know that the potion works I [Music] need at least like two servings of the potion and I'm and you're going do you need to test it as well yeah and this is to not bring back spells but resistance rate or whatever he decides to do with it you want me you're going to need to go somewhere where there's deep haze yep is that the mage tower or the crater the mage tower the castle in the crater want me to get the potion drink it and walk into deep haze and hope for the best it doesn't have to be you just do the right things no not the ratleys they're resistant to it already that means I'm out it needs to be a human guys your oh oh you're happy I'm half paying attention take a look up what if we can convince Jupiter Jones to drink the potion to go into a dangerous area we'll work on that I don't think we need to convince him if we were to give him a potion of his resistance and it works that's like a win for him you could do incredible things just depends on how long it lasts for I wouldn't want to give him unlimited he's resistance when I say convinced I mean more so play up well I have a potion that can allow me to go anywhere in the city Oh betterment moves and then well better than lose never lose we can maybe come up with something well I could also draw me a river we got you figured out I've got one more for you whoever he drinks this potion it might be good to have a blood sample before and after I can figure that out too collect as much information as you can oh you're going to save as much blood it's okay no we don't know what much blood but if we can get a sample of someone's blood before they've been affected by an after oh oh you didn't get the blood of someone who actually was exposed to the deep hazen we'd have a control subject can you get a control subject wow that would actually be excellent can you try to get a blood sample of someone who's been exposed to the haze without resistance insane without resistance right weak like a body we could talk to via no we need someone who's been exposed to it but is a lie we could talk to the cult yeah the cult of the falling fire they love the haze Thank You Lyn it yeah we have some contacts there we've met some people okay okay they get contact haze I think elder can the the Academy will be happy with this say that again go to Queens Park Gardens get eldritch lilies get oscar to make these potions and get as much as many samples as you can bring them back to me and Eldrick in amberwood village as soon as you can and you're gonna carry this meteorite we got you covered oh thanks Arabs I have eight pieces of delirium for you oh okay how much [Music] I've got some more salmon for you and for the rest of you I've got some gold but I also have something special yeah pay you 50 gold pieces for each shard Wow are we rich I'm going to pay you for little shards and I'm going to give you these as an advance on the job that you haven't finished yet she pulls out the vials she gives you six piles she hold she holds it in front of you Sebastian's as Sebastian this is aqua delirium it has been synthesized by the mage guild distilled delirium in liquid form you can drink it but don't drink more than one because it will make you really sick if you do and powerful sick with fire so aqua delirium to explain in game terms here's how it works these potions you can drink one and when you do you regain one d3 plus one levels worth of spells lots however if you regain for spell slots the maximum possible when you drink a dose of aqua delirium the next spell you cast will trigger a Wild Magic search hmm that's what we do it for if you drink more than one dose of aqua delirium in a 24-hour period you will take one d12 psychic damage her spouse lot recovered and have your hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt and nothing can prevent that damage and does it go after like an amount of time it the the hit points lost go away after you take a long rest if this damage if the damage from drinking aqua delirium kills you it's very bad [Music] I foresee some drinking potions in my future so if I have to drink the resistance to the haze thing you have to try this I'm trying no willingly trying no I'm already curious to see what happens if you try to drink it now we have to stop you she says we learned the hard way what happens when you overdose on awkward delirium and it's not pretty yeah paint me a word picture imagine being turned inside out now imagine that happening to you noted what were you imagining I don't want to see her insides today yeah I've seen the earth signs and looks bad enough so you're taking all this in delirium yes okay thank you what do you work on tinnitus she says if you'd like to test it you're more than welcome to leave it to that as long as you don't spell yes chug it as long as you're not doing back to max I think you're okay she don't shovel fist yeah no double fisting I should be holding this I'm your bf Oh should we split it up I got I got it I got it don't you have a you have a delirium problem that you're trying to get over no the idea of it empowering me is very intriguing but I've never actually been able to actively test that because it's horribly poisonous I may have tried a few times when I was younger and it didn't go over well I was sick for days but now I can drink it okay and it will make me more powerful and this is interesting it's a it's a thick kind of soupy liquid that is a translucent purple color and it glows softly inside the vials each vial is only about the the Aqua delirium itself the vials only contain about two ounces of liquid so it's not a lot of stuff they basically pound it left back like a shot nope you could you know in the middle of battle I am thank you River thank you ain't a river glad that we were able to end on good terms I need I have you upset with me we look forward to finishing off our mission with Oscar good hunting thanks for giving us a second chance and testing the new potion they want me to take this meteor to amberlynn village for you oh yeah drop it off at the crow crow and Suns yeah crowing Suns just drop it off at curling Suns Oh your dad yeah watch me he's actually very very well I have a brother and two sisters now really yeah you remarried oh it's I must be awkward I mean I haven't seen her in 15 years I mean I guess there were there was I was I was worried that it would be worse and he seems happy and he did welcomed me back into his life so I think I mean given the array of possibilities that could have happened mmm it turned out in the better favor well that's impressive I guess you got a place to stand Neverland village oh yeah good good I think Elric's looking to make some other arrangements when we're there but we'll take it one day at a time I guess you don't go to the old house anymore but Barkin Buzzard he's still around oh really yeah do you do you still do you still drink they have anything dealing crappy beer no can I buy you one next time we're there sure cool old friends new potions with that super duper I never utters a few words and she conjures a tensors floating disk beneath the she's way better wizard meteor piece and it hovers into the air and follows along behind her as her and her bodyguard begin to walk to the south towards Everwood village yeah so the thing about River is she always knew much more tactically good spells than me I just tended to blow things up a lot of gee she was yeah good team so what's your next move then I'm a sorcerer she's a you're a sorcerer to be determined I we could rest in the barn or in the mill okay so team huddle I guess it's just us um we have no rats no meter we have all alone we have paladin's that we wanted to check on cuz they're about to make a march on a gate and we don't really know what they're doing here yeah we do want to go to ember wood village because I miss my family and we have money to spend and now it might be beneficial to go get elders lilies before we hit up a Blewett village it's going to be another few days isn't it how long do you think it's going to get Louise well okay the way that I see it in order to get back into the city we need to go back through the hooded Lantern's gate pull up the map yeah sure I think I see where your head's at the Green Lantern Green Lantern the hooded Lantern the hooded lanterns want information about the paladins the paladins are down at is a temple row gyah yeah they're there their camp several miles outside the city so that's still a bit of a hike but what I was thinking is if we gathered that Intel just went talk to them found out what they were doing headed back through Sheppard's gate delivered that message to the hooded lanterns continued on our way to Queens Park Gardens God al Durga lilies and then went to amberwood village is that way to elaborate guys no I'm just wondering are we backtracking too much back where is couldn't we go to Queens Park come back out Sheppard's way down to temple Road and then go to ember wood and then on our way back we can drop off that information or do you think they're gonna go that's true that's what I'm not sure and then I thought of a lab that goes to Queens Park we go down by the crater to collect a body that's full of haze and then go to ember bird village and then circle back up and talk to the palate and then go to the show right we can't really go and go near the crater can we but we have to go to the falling fire people and they're down there and by that time we might have a potion do you think they'd let us in through the gym they do champions wavering they love us now we we saved that monk guy who occupies markets market market game nobody it's it's occupied by some monsters we could kill our way in no too much champions way the falling fire yes the followers of the falling fire control champions gate those are a main objective we ever know we have like a couple of different like getting Denver wood village is not necessarily the most important but I think if we can get the information for River as soon as possible about the serum but I think timeliness the paladin's are more important yeah that's the thing is the pellet remember what the commander said what was the I know they were assembling but did we have a did we have a time crunch on on the Paladin there's rumblings that the paladin's might be mustering to attack temple gate but as far as what their timeline is on that it's not known because that's that's the only concern I have is if we have time we could wait but if we don't we need to know before but is that a high priority do we care about helping the commander depends on who we care more about the commander or a river it's not so much helping the commander it's that we don't we don't know what the paladin's want in Drakon and I'm why are they going for a gate why are they here they're not from Drakon Heim they're not from they're not from caste either they're from another land yeah they're from Illyria Illyria yeah we call that non caspia from you as via i yeah you would yeah where is Oscar Oscar on your map is at read manner which is seven on your map so what's what's our priority I think this this boils down to and so that you know another high Hays concentration is it ten on your map which is where the mage guild power is oh yeah oh that's nearby so we could keep in the North half we'd have to find somebody alive there a human yeah or I could just sit in the meet in the haze really good day well we need your bombers but no guys what's more important Queens Park Gardens or the paladins are we expected to have this information for Queen Park Gardens forever in the day that she's meeting with this guy I think uh actually that's a good question is she like hanging out in Everwood Village for a while she didn't really say no she didn't seem to expect you to be doing it pretty quick though like as excited as she as she was it was kind of like her the tone was just giving it was like finish the job I gave you yeah I think I mean considering that was one of the first jobs you took I think that would be I consider to be priority yes we want to get the information for the paladins but I suppose talking to the paladin's before they kill a ton of knowles or after they kill a ton of knows doesn't really make a difference other than to the members remainder wanted them to fail ideally but i'm i'm i'm with veo that's where my my allegiance kind of leans towards is i don't these hooded lanterns i not feeling them like this this tax that they're imposing and this idea that they're this old guard and and they're kind of getting in the way of caspian treasure-hunting yeah the only reason we can get into the city properly so we can't burn that bridge yeah we can't it's not a bridge we can burn but they did say you could try to talk to like they weren't they know that it's not imperative well we're not gonna complete missions necessarily how long will it take us to get to temple road am i it's it's not a matter of getting to temple road directly it's the fact that the the paladins camp is about ten miles out of town they're not surrounding me yep no know where they are they're not on the map because that there they're a ten miles south along temple road no we can do I'm wondering if the rap Prince can be a lookout for the gate or maybe he can send some spies out to watch for the movements and if they start to move that's when we come back and do that I was thinking the same thing but even with your pigeons like if we've found our way back to the market your pigeons could be like could come and warn us if the it looks like the paladins are moving on the gate hopefully they're intelligent enough to remember I don't know get them give them some more salmon I think I'm okay with this I mean for me it's less of wanting to help the hooded lanterns it's more wanting to know all the people we're up against in the city but I we could talk to the paladins anytime I just want to know what their deal is I want to make yeah we'll have to I want to make a call on them I think the timeliness of it is yes we should know but if they're starting to make a move that's I think when we need to get the information whereas getting the lilies and helping River out I think is a number one priority because that group I could also give us if we can get resistance to Hays yeah yeah I could be detriment we could really push the tower now much the Creator that will help us with the lanterns long term goals as I said getting into better and giving you castle yeah I think that will go okay I mean we know Vale wants into the castle and I want I want to check out where the meteor fell and why check out the crater and also want to get in the castle why do you want to go to the castle I like castles um Caspian it's again my name pretty much is are you in dragon time to go to the castle because you like like you like houses yeah your sight see I told you I'm a visitor like and I give the the corpse the horse curves kick I'm like I'm loving this like I really feel like I'm part of the community I really love killing and I'm getting lots of choice chances to kill lots of good stories yeah I do I am in search of some odet to caspia that mean it means that there are certain treasures that I'm sure Jupiter knows about - that belonged to caspia and it's my job to reclaim them as part of Caspian tradition where these treasures are they in the castle they're everywhere and it's my job to come find them they're everywhere in the city okay and they they are owed to my people and this javelin is pretty cool but it's not one of them I need more I need more to send back to my family we're we're friends right Pluto yeah you're not no I want treasure what's the hide okay cool I mean stew I want treasure I don't trust many people and I want the there's Caspian treasure that's indirect and I'm and it belongs to my people and I'm going family heirlooms anybody that I've ever trusted who's gone against that trust but I know that you won't because we're friends yes I trust them yes yes yeah all right we're good this is working yeah I think yeah let's uh let's find I would say like rat folk at least they're a little bit more intelligent than my pigeons yeah yeah we can use them is and I think the the rat nest is long way too I was thinking the pigeons because they can fly like your other pit they were they were those scout out the like they can get around really quick the rats don't but I mean that depends if you get back to at least there's at least a bunch of them that you're okay with them yeah we're okay they're kind of are some despair they're kind of her we kind of do a bit or we can do both like then there's on the ground and because I feel like we'll have time by the time the Paladins actually March as a military leader I know it takes time and most of them will die on the way probably just like my hater just [ __ ] but I'm speaking from person you guys want to go flower picking oh we go on flower picking we're gonna have to fight our way it's a wonderful time no but I've heard the Queen's Park garden is a pretty dangerous oh right in there yeah take a nap at the mill yeah yeah I mean I yeah you should yeah so you want to camp out at the mill and then set out again back the way you came into the city again yep yes okay well we didn't know that we had this job we needed to meet River she didn't want to miss it that's true and how do you in and out of the city is par for the course and we got a we got the mini D right yeah that was a huge yeah yeah this has been a winning winning trip out of the city okay got delirium aqua accord where iam yeah I'm gonna catch some of that yeah you gotta make sure just a good time please no no don't go crazy on it okay Pluto okay so with that you make camp at the Ackerman mill I'm guessing probably having most of these conversations that you just had as you settle down yeah we were setting up camp and chatting and and setting out the next day to head back the way you came into the city back through you're gonna go through Shepards gate at the hooded lanterns and use that to get back in the city hood okay sir badge yeah yeah okay and what by what way do you want to head to Queens Park garden first we're gonna go by the rats nests yeah so before we can actually go we have to get them set up to watch the Ramla corn hills then we can head down to Shepards way hit up the rat's nest just to let the rat Prince know what's up head through Shepherds gate and well it looks like there's kind of a strait and we had Shaffer elderts lilies yeah straight shot of right and then there's some back roads that kind of lead right to Queens Park Garden okay so I'm I'm pretty okay to kind of fly through that through that and cuz that way this way that you've traveled now the the way through around Shepherds way towards the gates well there are rat folk in that area you're known to the rat folk so when you encounter them they recognize you for who you are rather than attack you which is really what most of the prob what most of the people that get hurt in Shepherds way are attacked by rat folk who fear you and know you so that is a way in and out of the city it's actually pretty safe for you to just take Shepherds way in and out getting to the the rat's nest and letting the rat prints and his family know to keep an eye on temple gate for you is no problem and don't they'll let you know what they know but you're gonna have to come back like do the question is do you want it like how do you want them to warn you how are they going to get information to you about that changing are there rat broke in the city can they use the sewers to come contact us like the way we got in mostly just the rat Prince has has a route so they could come and get you if there was something going going down but it would probably need to be the rat prince himself that comes I think if we what we can do is if we haven't come back yet come find us at the Queen's Park Garden but on our way back out of the city we can stop by and say you don't have to do it anymore nothing's happened also if we stop and never stay at the clock tower again yeah we should be able to tell if the Paladins are moving they can please stop there at least once between now and I think if we if we just did a quick and maybe on our way so yeah we could stop in and just take a quick look yeah I can get a view and see what's that yeah okay okay all right I think what we will do is we will wrap up there for this put this evening and we will pick it up right away at Queen's Park next week well you'll have a little bit of a trek through the city streets but at this stage if you're traveling by shepherds way that area of the city is pretty much safe travel over for your group unlock that part of the map yeah pretty much point yeah it is a safe way to get in and out of the city and that you've made the agreements I think that that's a pretty big achievement that just just out alone that you have that passage in and out is a big advantage that very few people in Drakon Heim have yeah yeah take that Jupiter a weep Jupiter has it too I feel like oh yeah but you got beat up by troll so I'm still winning yeah yeah it's a new pee rat folk harpy's trolls multiples Noel's trolls and Noel's and trolls and cubes trolls Knowles and what are the keep sculpt just you know an excuse old trolls and gelatinous cubes neuroscience cubes yeah I'm feeling I'm feeling pretty high up on my horse that died in the rivers by or I miss you horse I was named horse it was Benny like eggs Benny yeah all right can you see the eggs so we'll wrap up there for this evening a really big
