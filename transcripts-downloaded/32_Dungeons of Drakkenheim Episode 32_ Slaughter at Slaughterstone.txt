'true vo the seven bells of Saint Vittorio begin to sound as the Noles pull on the strings in the tower the entire city comes to horrible life and you can see the Knowles climbing their way onto the rooftops drawing bow strings as you make your way towards Market Square the Lord of the feast howls and barks in infernal crying out flash you shall be a great Andre at my dinner table this evening the words howling out in a vicious dialect of the infernal and abyssal languages is paged in language sounding out howling through the streets of Drakon hein as the lord of the feast begins his pursuit youth our three heroes have got just a slight head start ahead what will you do say oh he said we're totally invited for dinner oh that's an invite that was an infernal welcoming - I just I I don't remember my dialects it's either to eat or to be eaten I wasn't okay uh here on if I hear it again um should we fire a green flare is he pursuing us he's pursuing us yes the red hold the red flare just in case I want to shoot the green flare okay and let it let it shoot up between the narrow streets as we keep our healthy distance [Laughter] you fire the green flare which resounds out above the rooftops of the temple ward exploding in a flash of color as you do so you can see a hooded figure raise a crossbow in one of the nearby rooftops and nod down they see us well how far ahead are we right now I don't want to turn around Pluto turn around okay I'm holding up our map let us look at the route that you've told me that you're gonna take you are at point 11 on the map at Cathedral Square and you are heading to that little square that's just south of Market Square it's actually not labeled on this map that's bad DM but it's the little square that's immediately south of the War of the II of Market Square so you're gonna head straight along the the southern edge of Market Square take the wide Avenue down to slaughter stone square unless you want to take the back streets um as typical navigator I'm going to say keep to the main roads we don't want any ambushes that we're not expecting okay I'm on board you will fireball your way down market square take a hard right towards temple the where temple road intersects with the Market Square and then into slaughter stone Square this journey is a little more than a quarter mile or so so it'll only be on horseback at breakneck speed it'll only be a few minutes to get there hmm are you ready yes can I take a potion before as we're going here yes you have a little bit of a head start as the Lord of the feast musters to get going what will you do with that time I'm gonna take a potion the ointment how much do we get back from 18 points I'm gonna take that how many are left in the ointment now four can you toss it over yes kick I rub ointment on my chest on horseback yeah nice nice throw as you're galloping through the streets do you need some as well I'd love some ointment to ointments left that's 18 yeah back up it puts me at a flail range okay just like so you're all taking a dose yes okay I'm gonna keep my other potion for if we need it it sounds good is there anything that you would like to do with your last moments of preparation because then we're gonna roll for initiative can I drink a potion if you would like to yes you can I'm gonna drink an aqua delirium potion okay rola D four three three so you get regained four levels worth of spells I want to drink a potion of heroism okay you have drank your potion of heroism I and you were each individually on horseback so for your purposes remember your horses all have an AC of eighteen or an AC of sixteen a speed of 60 feet and thirty three hit points I think I'm gonna hold off on my potion of invisibility just in case I need to fire her as we're going because yeah Sebastian ended up mounted on his own horse now give it the way they escape the escape went yeah do you want to jump on my horse no I got this I'm learning very quickly horse okay I'm gonna have you all roll for initiative 18 no bad AC 16 33 hitpoints speed of 60 what do we got 16 16 prevail 8 8 for Sebastian 21214 pollute oh okay wow so 20 in a 1 I'm really feeling like I find a middle ground this is actually pretty straightforward so you will all go first my 8 yeah I rolled really poorly for the lord of the feasts nice it was a sea of again yeah I did yeah incidentally the lord of the feast does not have a dexterity bonus I believe it was 16 AC 33 here points 60 speed yeah okay and remember your mount goes on your turn and it can take the - dodge and disengage actions okay so here's what we're gonna have we're because we're rushing through the city streets we're gonna keep this in our minds as the Chase Begins the lord of the feast is currently is currently a hundred and 20 feet behind you all and he is the longbow and he has a longbow your pursuit is a straight run until you turn around it's a straight shot pollute oh you are first act Oh as you do you turning behind you you can see the Lord of the feast in pursuit atop the chuva and he is surrounded by a pack of death dogs that are baying and howling coming forward towards you as well and Noel's are beginning to flood the streets some of them even hopping atop the larger death dogs to use them as an ounce as well so like just a typical sort of day in dragon I just think just a regular like a riot in the streets I'm so scared well I ride as fast as I can I'm gonna 120 feet yeah I'm just gonna ride I'm gonna ride and I'm my horse is going to take the dash action okay and what are you gonna do for your action for my action I am going to ready a ready my javelin if something comes within range okay so if something gets on the side of us or in front of us that I can hit with the javelin all right Vail what are you gonna do um if I ride backwards on my horse am I at a disadvantage if you ride completely backwards are you disadvantaged yes but if but you can turn around to shoot okay I will then - with my horse okay and I'm gonna turn around and I'm gonna aim straight at Lord of the feast straight at the load of the feast okay all right and I'm going to where am I there I am use my dread ambusher so I'm gonna get three texts let's do it Oh ten its sales rate passed him sixteen as the arrow aside 1717 yeah okay that is a hit because he's not using his shield because he's got his bow out so the arrow strikes him but as it sails forward to strike him one of the death dogs leaps up and takes the arrow I mean if he wants to such loyalty such role damage against the deaf dog oh there we go 26 the arrow goes right through one of the heads of the death dog and that the one head is just limp now and the other head is controlling the rest of the body yep and my last shot twenty that that is a hit on the Lord of the feast twenty damage he howls out and grits his teeth reaching in grabbing the arrow and turning it back into his bow that was so cool Sebastian you're up I'm also gonna dash with my horse okay and I'm going to turn and I'm assuming there's like rubble and stuff around the edges of the street there are yes would you say that the lord of the feast is in the middle of the road and there's death dogs yes surrounding him so I'm gonna try to clear out some of the death dogs or at least stop their pursuit by using mold earth to burst some of the rubble down in front of them okay so that some of them get like stopped or have to weave okay make a spell casting ability mobility check what's the range on Mulder thirty feet okay so this is immediately behind you yeah okay so I'm just trying to cause like shows part of the road okay to create some difficult ground yeah yeah 17 so you turn up some a pile of the earth pulling away a pit that we will see what happens to the death dogs as they come up in pursuit of that we come around to the Lord of the feast spurring the chuva forward he rushes forward a hundred feet it seems like the chuva is not as fast as your horses yeah thank goodness we just gotta watch out for going too fast and as he does so he pulls back his bow and he fires three shots one at each of your horses oh no Sebastian they - that's a ten yay oh he gets a seven and Pluto he gets a ten to hit your horse oh wow she fires the arrows at your at your mounts zigzag and as he as he does so as well several Noel's all that are riding atop the the death dogs as well they each fire arrows at you but they do so with disadvantage because they are not as good riders as the Lord of the feast so against Sebastian it's a wide miss against pollute Oh another wide miss and it gets veo double natural ones that is the worst advantage so a hail of arrows right Rises forward towards you and as they do so you come around the corner and as we come to around the top of the round as the Noles are firing and the silver order charges forward as well quite suddenly from out of one of the streets appear several knowles that are pushing a cart forward into the street in front of Market Square Pluto it's your turn what are you going to do I'm going for the jugular I'm gonna try to take down the strongest looking knoll okay the wonder they're hauling the cart forward to block the as you come out in the market square like this is the part of the street where it would open they're basically pulling this large wagon in the way of the street to block your exit are they carrying and doing it by rope there there they've just grabbed the the yoke of it and they're just pulling it forward like they are the pack animals there's several behind pushing there's four Knowles two pulling two two more pushing I'm gonna try to knock the one of the ones pulling okay I'm gonna try to I hukka javelin oh yeah baby it's like a like a 29 okay that is a hit I love the damage for oh sorry I didn't I don't know da Tyrol 11 damage 11 damage and are you gonna knock and prone um is that what you wanted to do to knock it prone or not how far am i away you are just within javelin range to throw the javelin okay so I'm gonna hit and then as I close in I want to I want to grab the javelin back like pull it back in and then hit him again I like recall the job yeah yeah throw it again yeah and just mess up his whole life come for a 27 to hit also hit for 10 damage that slays him that's also over a dead the remaining Knowles continue to push if you guys haven't taken the Noles out by the by the time it gets to all all your turns are over you're all gonna have to make checks to avoid this card somehow I as I close in on so I recall the javelin again on the second attack mm-hmm and I want to use my shield and slam into the other one that's well they're not that close yet yeah you're not close enough to actually if you were you'd already need to be avoiding the car - got you yeah yeah then I will second wind okay and I'm gonna turn around and action surgeries like I could or no wait are you just second winning today yeah yeah okay and I want to I want to yell back at this demon dog this evil chuva lord of the fee I'm gonna yell back and infernal I'm remembering it like I I just been practicing aye aye aye I thought you were hungry is your stomach not growling and i taunt nice and I'm gonna recall ya 17 hit points with my old second wind Vale Europe oh and and this time horse is taking Dodge it's gonna Dodge okay um so how far away are we from the cart you are it depends on how far you want to move on your turn mm it's enough that you'll it's at the start of your turn it'll be 80 feet away from you okay yeah then I'm going to use the dodge action as well on the horse on the horse and take the two shots at knowles that are pushing the cart okay nice 23 that is a hit for 21 damage on one of the knowles nice how much damage 21 that goes right through his jugular and he drops to the ground and the other to Knowles seeing that the front two knowles have died they put the heave forward a little bit more the front wheels of the cart crushing the heads of the dead Knowles and kind of exposing them the cart is about halfway into the street now what are you gonna do take another shot at one of the nos 212 that's a hit nice 20 damaged he dies and the last note isn't strong enough on his own to push the cart at all anymore it's still half way through the street though Sebastian it's your turn what are your thoughts on using the ring of spell sports is spells storing and then a quicken spell or are those still accounting as to spells you're casting the spell when you use it from the ring of spell storing so you can use your meta magic with it but can I cast that and another spell use your casting the spell so it follows all the rules from so then I'm just gonna use the ring of spell storing normally then and just I'm gonna cast I have an enlarged reduce okay in my ring of spell storing and I'm gonna reduce the cart nice okay so you shrink the cart down yeah I hold out my hand with my ring and shrink the cart nice no the cart shrinks down to size and how far forward are you gonna go I'm going to also take the dodge action with a horse and move up 60 feet okay so you have all moved 180 feet forward and the lord of the feast I hope that's okay I want his turn we want to stay together so I thought yeah but we also want him to keep following us we don't so you guys were 300 feet forward from the Lord of the feast and now he is he is now a hundred feet you have 200 feet on him right now but it's his turn Wow yeah okay the lord of the feast because you shrunk the cart you will all be able to ride by it by it just fine provided enlarge reduce stays in place at the start at the start of your next turn the Lord of the feast charges forward he's now within a hundred feet of you all and he fires his longbow at your mounts he does so with disadvantage against Sebastien's mount he gets a 21 oh my gosh against Pluto's mount he gets a six and against vales mount he gets a 16 so two of your mounts are hits Sebastian your mount takes eight points of piercing damage vales yours takes 11 points of piercing damage come on stormy weather and both of you I need you to both make acrobatics or athletics checks to hold yourselves in the shot the saddle as your horses are real up twenty six seven seven okay Sebastian you are checked on your horse you have two options right now you can fall off the horse or you can give up your action next turn and make a concentration check I'm gonna I'm gonna stay on the horse okay give me a concentration check d c---ten I'm good okay so Sebastian because your horse real reels up you're gonna lose your personal action next turn because you basically have to clutch onto its neck this is stopping concentration in action it is not no no okay and the roommate and several other knowles fire shots forward there's gonna be four shots and of those two shots are gonna go towards pollute Oh again these are done with disadvantage so pollute oh I get a nine and a nine Sebastian you get shot once for a ten against your AC and they'll I get a twenty against your AC with one Knoll shot yep that's gonna be five big old points of damage as the rain of arrows as the pack rushes forward several of the Warriors of the silver order cryo q we're coming up to a side street we get split off and try to get the pack away from you but there's gonna be nothing between you and the lord of the feast if we do that that's why we took that over the red player like do we stay together and shoot the red flare yes okay and let them save themselves pull the pack off see what you can take with you okay and as they come forward I mean have the Lord of the feast make a athletics check to leap over your mold earth I hate which was your spell same DC spell safety C is 16 okay so I have to roll against your spell save DC and I get a 17 athletics okay okay so he leaps over the the rough ground and so you can have the silver order break off we got this yeah let's if if that if that distracts them just for a minute or a second yeah let's send the alright the rest of the order off we don't want any more like guide your path thanks you to see Joe we go to the top of the round with pollute oh do I shoot the red flare get past the cart and then shoot the red flare yeah I get past the cart okay you rush past the cart and I'm gonna let the the flare go okay and I'm going to move my whole speed and then use the dodge action you were gonna dodge or you're sorry I'm my mounts gonna dodge why he's a hundred feet we go 60 he goes a hundred so he's gonna close in I know I'm gonna take the - okay I'm gonna - you - into Market Square and fire the red flare okay and you fire the red flare Sebastian oh sorry Vale I also - Cape still flipping around and taking some more shots this time at the chuva at the chuva yeah aiming for more like their shoulder so I don't want to like direct hit but just to slow them down a little bit okay at 20 okay the Lord of the feast has the mounted combatant feet he redirects the hip to him okay I mean if you if you want 18 damage okay nice another shot 18 to hit cool another one of the death the death dogs leap up again and absorb the shot 23 damage kills it BAM you miss it the meow meow you get the pap ow alrighty Sebastian you're up so as the last one to pass by the mini cart as soon as I get past it I get rid of my concentration so the cart pops back and I don't get an action this turn so I'm just gonna - with my horse okay nice you guys are for hunt you are about a third of the way there you're getting there together okay you - into Market Square you're on the the western half the clock tower looms in the distance you're only a couple rounds away from making the turn that from the Turnpike the Lord of the feast crashes forward he's now 300 feet only 120 feet behind behind you and as he does so the cart enlarges in front of him and he makes an accurate an athletics check to pull the chuva out of the way to avoid it getting a 20 what about the death dogs the death dogs though several of the death dogs collide with the side of the cart in fact one of the death dogs tries to leap over it as it enlarges and the cart enlarges and just sends it flying Sebastian looks over his shoulder and he's like oh man that was cool that's the best I could have it's like yep as the lord of the feces lord of the feces the blood dripping from veis mount and he fires all of his arrows at it Oh getting a 6 a 21 and a 13 to hit so one of them 8 damaged because the cart has just been enlarged though and the silver order has written off they pulled away enough of the Noles that none of the Noles are able to get effective shots off at you this turn cool you race into markets Market Square Market Square though is he is covered in debris there are broken carts market stalls and bodies everywhere this is difficult ground to race a horse through so on your turn and if you want to - I'm gonna need an ability check or some sort of action from you to clear the path because this is difficult ground to move through at breakneck speeds top of the round with pollute Oh what will you do the Lord of the feast is a hundred and twenty feet behind you do Pluto has some quick thinking and he's like we need to buy some time while we get through this area you can if you want to if you have any skill as a rider in athletics or animal handling you can also drive them out if you want to I am proficient in animal handling ok I'm going to take the - oh no sorry the dodge action on my mouth ok I'm gonna ride my 60 feet ok and I want to throw one of my balls from my bag of tricks behind me ok distract them roll a d8 I got a one and it was the tan bag it is the tan bag of tricks it's a jackal a jackal a jackal a jackal appears in in the road a taking shape several feet behind you as you rush forward because you are moving at moderate speed you can give me an animal handling check - drive your horse [Music] 8:8 okay your horse stumbles in the streets ahead of you give me a dexterity saving throw otherwise you will be flung from your mouth Oh biscuits seven seven okay pollute Oh instead of making it another 60 feet forward you rush forward forty feet when your mount stumbles and you're toppled from the horse and you and the horse land prone that's not good I say in my head from the fall I also take you take seven bludgeoning damage and your mount takes six bludgeoning damage Oh biscuits vo it is your turn I use the the dodge action on the horse okay and I'm going to continue to distract the Lord of the feast with some shots okay so we can still see him correct I you can still see him he is a hundred and twenty feet behind you Oh 21 that is a hit 21 damage ouch nope eight okay he is incensed as he pulls the arrows out you can actually see though it looks like the wounds are healing like he might be regenerating from some sort of like you can see that they are leaking out with the kind of blackish purple bile that he bleeds yeah but the where the arrows have shot in the the blood flow stops and clots and pulls itself back together he is regenerating as he takes these shots he's not getting hurt oh okay and rush forward sixty feet I need you to make in animal handling handling athletics or acrobatics check acrobatics I got 26 you spur the horse kick it into high gear and you rush forward on the back of your mount deftly dodging out of the way of all the debris going forward okay Sebastian it is your turn is the debris clear bowl by mold earth many of the debris here is not rubble but actually actual carts and manufactured objects market stalls and even some corpses would it be a bonus action in action to scoop Pluto up it would be an action if you want to scoop Pluto Apple then I am going to quicken [Music] would it would it logically would I be able to scorching ray a bunch of the debris out of the way like blast it if you want to blast the debris yeah uh yeah you can okay so I'm gonna quicken scorching ray and I'm going to blast the debris out of our way nice it's so cool and then with my action because I quicken that I'm going to reach out my hand as I ride by Pluto Jackson and pull him up and pull him okay horse okay alrighty make your attacks with scorching ray epic alright first attack gets a nineteen okay second attack gets twenty okay third one is sixteen all three hit and the objects here as loose wood timber they're vulnerable to fire damage so double the damage that you deal as long as you deal over 25 points of damage you will blow away all the debris 9 I'm going to use another point to re-roll one of those dice oh that's another one so six I yep okay 15 10 more 25 okay okay the debris is blown out the road is clear you go to scoop pollute Oh Jackson up I'm gonna have you both make strength checks Oh Pluto as I'm riding by and like Pluto you're gonna have to do most of the work okay does my blessed help with no it doesn't it's just us does it yep can I use automatics yep 14 14 what did you get for four I'm looking for a combined total of 15 or higher so the working together Pluto does most of the work and you pull it and Pluto you pull yourself up on to Sebastian and almost you off the hole I put out my arm you grab it almost pull me off let go and you just climb onto the horse yourself without touching yeah yeah yeah both of you can give me dexterity or saving throws do 16 16 13 okay so there is a bit of a slip-up as the two because Sebastian your check was really really low it would have been really easy for you to slip out but you're able to kind of pull yourself back up and write yourselves so you both will be able to act normally on your turns as your horse rushes forward as so you guys are now on two horses my horse is gonna take the dodge action thank you okay your horse dodges and vales horse dodge horse done as well okay the Lord of the feast takes his turn and he makes his way ever forward so you guys are now 469 thanks but he got she-mail hold on tight Sebastian blue two up yeah yeah Sebastian blew it all up so no he doesn't have to worry about it as he does so he fires two arrows at feyo's mount getting an eight and a 18 yes and one arrow at the amount of the two of you getting a 14 know they'll your mouth takes seven damage how's it looking seven damage yep seven points left okay don't worry you can run faster than the horse okay actually actually you are coming around the bend to make a sharp 90-degree turn into into slaughter stone square the clock tower looms in front of you it's broken clock face stuck between pandemonium and limbo in the shadow of the clock tower the sharp turn at the speed that you're going at will be a difficult maneuver what will you do I give the reins to Pluto okay so Pluto it's your turn I need you to take these I don't know how to turn a horse do i yes I do I can turn a horse and I do it I turn the horse ever so well I'm a good horse guy horseman horse man I am Minotaur man I am I do I'm gonna do the turn okay is there anything else you like to do with your action ooh now that I'm holding the reins it's just way better that you're holding the reins than me you're I can't ride a horse I want the shield on my back and I want to try to like use it to like okay fully take one of the arrows that's so you're dodging effectively first sure coming okay um at me us caitli okay and I think we'll make how close is you know if you go forward full speed he's 60 feet behind you right now and then after you move he's going to be 180 feet behind you yeah we want to do that so we're gonna move we're gonna dash it okay you - it dad [ __ ] you - full speed breakneck forward is there anything else you'd like to do beyond dodging yourself I'm gonna continue to taunt him and infernal okay um uh oh and I tell my jackal I go I am the master of the dogs - and I go get him jackal and ok jackal lunges at the lord of the feast ok make an attack role with the jackal against the lord of the feast he gets a [Music] [Laughter] soon it's best out there he gets a 10 that doesn't hit but I'm gonna give them but the annoyance of the jackal will be basically getting like windshield in like it's like hitting a dog with your car the lord of the feast comes up to it and the the Shuba kind of stumbles over it as it leaps down the lord of these tries to control the Shiva for a moment but the chuva just goes right for the jackal and bites it at the jugular and starts devouring it and it's running as his eating so the chuva is only going to is not going to fully - this turn it's only going to move its full speed forward I'm horrified at the sight of my jackal friend being murdered but he did it for loves a magic dog didn't count magic dog didn't count you heard it Sebastian what are you or Vale what are you gonna do so if we - how far away are we from our destination you will be coming around the corner and then it's only 200 more feet to slaughter Stone Square from there okay before I go around the corner I'm gonna take two shots at the at the Lord of the feast okay I want to use magic arrows this time okay go for it smart 23 that is a hit sorry 26 damage nice second one if you kill him before we get there I'm gonna be upset so okay 25 25 damage yep okay okay with it he's taking a boatload of damage but he's not bloodied yet do I notice if he heals using magical arrows does we're looking for a specific kind of damage mmm okay okay fire he's super incensed though and he's definitely not gonna break the pursuit and then I'm going to - - as fast as I can yeah do beat on down enough is it working oh yeah red flare where's our backup it's coming okay lord of the Smashing literally I need to roll any eye not that okay the lord of the feast fires his arrows advaitha all of them advance mount getting a 19 yeah a 18 Wow and a nine my horse is done how dead is it lets you see it takes ten points of damage odds dead you're writing a dead horse yeah yep as the horse collapses to the ground dead okay they make a dexterity saving through ten you don't land prone but you take ten points of bludgeoning damage as you stumble in the street and land on your feet okay okay you can run faster than a horse right like Kay that's not my plan at this moment Anson and several of the hooded lanterns appear across on one of the buildings that is just at the intersection of Market row around the corner they unveil it off and Anson turned turns and he sees you stumble he's like Vail I've got one good shot I can use it to get you or get him get him okay he pulls back a large canvas revealing that the hooded lanterns have set up a ballista on the rooftops and he turns the ballista towards the Lord of the feast and he fires it at the chuva Juba getting a 26 to hit and the Shuba takes 30 points of piercing damage from this ballista shot yes and howls out its bloodied by it and the Lord of the feast has to make a check to stay in the saddle and he manages to stay riding but the chuva is just hobbled as it races races forward Wow all right they are you know brave the three of you now okay so my turn it is now your turn Sebastien awesome how far ahead are we from the Lord of the fees yeah you are a hundred and thirty feet and he looks like he's slowing down a bit the chuva is because it just got hit with a ballista shot you're also in control of the horse now so I am going to turn again and I'm just going to do the same thing I did before now that I've blown the rubble out of the way for us to breeze past I'm gonna use mould earth to cause more rubble to fall in the way nice and so I do it again I just create some difficult ground yeah and continue clutching on to Pluto for life okay so we now go to the Lord of the feast himself who Spurs the shuva forward across the difficult ground I can have a role with this advantage because of the mold earth and they get a 15 against your spell save DC not good they stumble and the Lord of the feast falls off the chuva the the shuva and he howls back at it and howl howls towards you because he's taking so much damage though he just you see the rage in his face he says I'm going to tear a wall to shreds and he gets on to his feet and begins to get back onto the shuva and spur it forward Pluto you're up continuing to taunt him in infernal haha nice fall no legs you had nine legs and you keep falling he's it's the it's like a translation yeah there's a huge I'm doing really ten years since I've done infernal sorry guys and I'm gonna Huck another ball [Laughter] get them go go gadget I got I roll the five and it is a Denton ten black bear awesome a black bear appears in the road by the Lord of the feast so bear go and and the shuva and you are now turning around the corner to take temple road down to slaughter stone square so as you pull this hard turn give me an animal handling check can i I'm okay an animal handling can I use let acceptor yeah because I'm better at that one and I got a 28 you run the corner and you are and in front of you is you come down the temple road you can see into slaughter stone square you can see looming in the distance the inert form of the executioner and as you either skyline down the street you can see it pushed up against the walls of the street here are two large siege barricades and behind them are three hooded lanterns on each side and they nod to you like they're ready to push them into place as soon as the Lord of the feast runs and trap them in the square you can see just in the distance all on the rooftops the hooded lanterns taking their positions on the rooftops with all their arrows in various weaponry I had a boy veil what are you gonna do so I'm off my horse you are off your horse it's dead you are on the ground about 80 feet away from the Lord of the feast okay I have a potion of invisibility that I'm going to chug as my action so I'm invisible and I disappear after taking this potion should I am gonna use my feline agility to double my speed okay that turn so I can go 60 feet towards the square but I'm gonna keep on the edges and if there's any side streets that I can take knowing I can get there I kind of zoom off invisibly there there in this part of the block the only side street now it would be just going down to me it's going down the road yeah that's fine cool Sebastian you are now out of line of sight of the Lord of a feast I don't know what to do with my turn I don't really need to stop him anymore he's already stopped I'm just gonna ready in action if he turns the corner I'm gonna shoot a fire bolt at him okay nice I don't think we have to do much else we're almost there we've made him super mad mm-hmm I want him to get back on the chuva and we're on the same horse so we're just moving 60 feet there you can see the Lord of the feast gets back on the chuva he mounts up and they they move forward a little bit but because they have to spend half their speed moving they only move forward another 500 feet and you could hear the lord of the feast howling out where are they where did they go because it seems like after being knocked from his mount and everything he doesn't know which direction you I went okay Pluto we have to go back but you two don't know that because you don't have line-of-sight to him either yeah Oh No as he gets back on the chuva he looks up to the roost where Ansem is hiding and as he and as he does so he sees Ansem up there takes his longbow and he fires three shots at Hanson oh he hit Sansom twice and and in Vail you hear Ansem cry out and and a few other hooded lanterns get back up and they they they go to fire shot shots at them and you just hear at some crime we need to embed in this position we need to abandon though there's more coming he points down the road towards another group of knowles which is now catching up with the rest of the pack to the lord of the feast as well top of the round Pluto what are you gonna do I am going to turn around okay do I hear the commotion you you hear a bunch of the shouting and you you hear the voiceless voice crying out abandon the position he's found us but still no no Lord because you come around the corner yeah I'd probably keep riding I do my sixty feet we have to have some sort of I think that we would like at this point I feel like I would turn around and be like is he following us still I want to yeah like I want to get him but how do I know he's because he should be right around the corner he should be right coming around the corner coming yeah I'm reading in action to to if he gets in range just to hook my javelin atom but okay I'm gonna keep writing forward okay I mean I don't know as you as you come forward you're now a hundred and eighty feet from around the turn from from the turn and the the hooded lanterns one of them shuts down to you where's the lord of the feast you can't go forward into the square until he's right behind you yeah you're right guy I want to keep yelling and infernal can he hear it with his super dog usually my black bear taunts him okay to get her on the corner black bear but bear bring him here oh can I see through his eyes or something crazy probably not no no yeah because you're not in line of sight of your black bear either you can't command it either it's just gonna do whatever it wants to do okay it's go get their stuff yeah probably like honey and jazzy they oh you can see that the lord of the feast is has no sense for where you've gone and is now turning the chuva and himself towards the building where Ansem was as if he's going to leap off the Shuba and clamor into the building in pursuit of Ansem and the others there's buildings around me correct there's buildings south of you yes these are the buildings of Market Square okay I want to climb up onto the roof okay the buildings using my climbing speed and I want to lay down on the roof mm-hmm and I want to use minor illusion to make the voice of Pluto talking in and for all towards the way that they went yelling at him nice I love it okay this will make you visible but you can make his stealth check to hide on the rooftop 28 okay the sound of this the lord of the feast snaps his attention back away spurs on the shuva and turns to move forward again Sebastian what are you gonna do magic it's awesome that you thought of that because I was literally gonna do the same thing and I think I still will so I hear that cry out at the corner mm-hm and thirty feet ahead of us like what after he turns the corner there's I'm gonna make Pluto's voice call out an infernal again kind of leaving him in the right direction school a corner talking that around the corner yeah so the lord of the feasts well done Spurs back on on his Shiva rushes forward he's now at the intersection and he locks eyes with the two of you he screams out and he fires three arrows at your mouth getting a twelve getting a sixteen an eight and a 17 to hit the horse so I have my horses HP here the horse takes it takes 14 points of piercing damage okay it's still good okay it's just it's just it's a pincushion it's just a giant running pincushion okay Pluto it is your turn seeing the renewed anger what did you guys say myself I just repeated the light was it was definitely gibberish I tried to make it sound like the last thing you yelled out but I don't know the language like broken maybe you said something about dinner so I'm like dinner dinner library going to sister just a lot of nonsense a lot of nonsense I lock eyes and I grin and I'm just I and I keep the horse going okay he how far now if he is from from your position so he you are about haha he come came around the corner it's 200 feet from around the corner to the start of slaughter stone square and so you are about sick you are about 120 feet down this part of the street okay yeah keeping riding doing the 60 taking the dodge action for the horse mhm and we're just gonna keep going and again I make eye contact i taunt more I say something about how his mom was a [ __ ] and his father was a was a stray and and like other dog related insults and yeah okay we come to Vale all right I'm on the roofs yep I am going to start dashing across the roofs trying to stay out of the line of sight of the Lord and if he's trying to get to the square so that way when I'm there I'm already on the roof making acrobatics check yeah 13 you leap across the rooftops you're able to keep yourself largely on on track and you are now halfway across the rooftops between the Market Square and slaughter Stone Square cool cool yep nice as you do so you can see that several of the other hooded lanterns have taken up positions there and you know an anthem is nursing his arrow wounds and they've kind of found a spot for for him to hide Sebastian I just want to keep them in pursuit so I'm gonna fire a fire bolt Adam so I just turn around so that may include are facing each other [Laughter] it's what's the range on fire ball 120 it's 100 yeah 120 so you are out of range to hit them but you can still fire it too spur him on yeah that's no no do I need to roll or is it just no and I yell that was a warning shot and it was alright the Lord of the feast races forward towards towards you getting it halfway down the street firing more arrows at your mount and it's dodging and it's he crits the mount no with the Dodge oh it's oh you're your mount was dodging I thought I was going for that I know I did dodging let me roll this is kind of the rim okay in that case is 15 to hit Oh second shot with this advantage is a total miss third shot with disadvantage is a 19 whew that's the one all right for six points of damage still good our horse you can make dexterity saving throws for the horse to stay on the horse the glue factory I didn't get a one if that's what you're wondering what do you get I got a one okay I got a 20 so it's two oh wait Plus bless but I got a one is one count for saving it's a no mix so you got a six okay so because there's two of you on the horse one of you failing is bad news bears because it affects both of you so yeah so Sebastian I'm gonna have you roll again if you succeed you both succeed but if you fail you both fail it's fine there's no pressure 9 you both fall off the horse box backwards and drops you rate at the rate at the barricades the slaughter stone square it I'm sorry we land on top of ya ironic and the two of you land prone I'm so heavy yeah your aisle and first you land on top and I clunk I can't look and I do like the sausage roll the Lord of the feast races forward toward - is racing forward towards you Pluto it's your turn what are you gonna do I stand up okay I stare him right in the eyes I kind of do the squint and I just and I go right for chuva shuva with my with my javelin of 18 that is a hit nice it is redirected to the Lord of the feast because he has the mounted combatant feed for eight damage okay and I want to have him make a strength oh wait hold on sorry it's uh yeah it's gonna be strength safe I get a sixteen so you tied yeah okay and he takes an extra three damage okay I'm gonna call it back and then I and I squint a little harder and I kind of like dig my feet yeah just check the arm I was just a little bit a little bit I'm so impressed and I go for chuva again for a but this time I'm going to what do you get to hit nine seventeen okay the Lord of the feast takes the shot again for 11 damage okay and then all boy I start backing off okay through the gate kind of like taunting him on and I'm gonna pull out my I'm gonna catch my javelin again okay the hooded lanterns not human and one of them makes kind of that we're ready whenever you're ready I think we're ready now you're up you said I'm about halfway yep yep I'm gonna continue to sneak along the rooftops at as fast as speed as I

really that's with that let's return to the ruins where our heroes have closed in on slaughter stone Square leading the Lord of the feast out from the Cathedral Square here into the well prepared trap of the hooded lanterns and the silver order that they have all designed together teamwork makes the dream work they Oh from your perch high atop one of the buildings of slaughter stone square you have quite the sight in front of you slaughter stone square has three main intersections that lead into it there are two main streets that come from Market Square that connect into it and then from the north at this intersection where you've entered in and then one main entrance to the south of slaughter stone square it's a roughly triangular kind of trapezoidal sort of shaped square and well there are some alleyways leading off in between the buildings these are the main streets that are closing in on it the whole square itself is some 250 or so feet in diameter and in the center of the square is the cistern the circular pool that leads down into the sewers about 50 feet away of it is also a great that is an access into the sewers before the cistern is a large executioner's block and the ruins of the gallows that used to go over top of the sister in itself and they're sitting inert is the massive form of the executioner the hulking machine of metal and gears its body covered in spikes upon which are impaled at least half a dozen corpses its metal face plated to look like an executioner's hood and two great smokestacks rising up out of its back from which a choking blackish purple smoke rises up into the end of the day light of this overcast day it lays there inert despite the fact that surrounding all of slaughter stone Square at the South the silver order has set up several barricades and you can see that they pulled carts lashed together barrels and other things to make this makeshift barricade to the south upon which at the top of this barricade they've made a makeshift rampart where there are many of the members of the silver order that have turned their Lance's into pikes and they're holding them down from the top here at the north end of the square the other road that intersects from the from the north the hooded lanterns have pulled across several carts as well and they've even made makeshift ladders that they've set all across the rooftops and there are several dozen of the hooded lanterns they're in positions with bows standing on top of one of the carts is the Lord Commander himself and you can see that he's got a pair of axes that he's holding in one hand the large battle axes and as he catches sight of you he flings a rope down and he yells out - yells out - the two of you come on just run run here you'll draw the ire of that big thing and we'll get you up to safety as he extend lowers the rope holding it in one hand extending the other as his axes are stowed he reaches out and says come on hurry and the other hooded lanterns that are flanking the side of the road there's about a dozen of them on the ground with several siege barricades that they look like in position to slam the this way shut behind them and they've lowered several ropes as well down the sides to pull themselves back up onto the city above the lord of the feast is barreling down like a raging bull atop the chuva towards the street and veil you are perched up on the rooftops of course all around slaughter stone square well some of the buildings are ruined many of them are still intact here and these are some of the tallest townhouses in Drakon Heim they all have these high steeples and the windows look down upon the square like a judgmental jury standing over those who were executed here at slaughter stone Square and of course most of these buildings have very large balconies as well because in the heyday of Drakon Heim people loved watching their executions here but of course the hooded lanterns many of them have taken positions up in these balconies and they've covered them over with canvas netting to give them snipers nests that they're gonna use to shoot shoot down below with that Pluto what will you do I so I'm like standing in this yeah and the entrance of the siege and he's barreling at me and I was drooling probably um did did my black bear do anything you can see the ragged a ragged limb from it hanging out of the mouth of a shoe of the shoe I'm so proud number one I'm gonna keep running backwards and I'm like making noise like I'm banging my my shield and my spear together I'm running back and I'm gonna really like to be the dodge action I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep luring like running towards the you run into the square and as you do so as you step foot into the square past the barricades there's the sound of wrenching metal and screeching gears as the metallic form of the of the executioner begins to animate and it rolls for initiative everyone's going back down below so it goes dead last [Laughter] good roll as you look down the as you look down the road as you head back into the square you can see that behind the lord of the feast is a massive pack of nulls probably several dozen of them at the very least maybe more that have been following in pursuit so the executioner goes dead last yep dead last then your allies will also get to act the pack the Lord of the feast and then we're keeping the same initiative order from before okay because this is effectively the same encounter so you rush into the square you take the dodge action you are in place they Oh what are you going to do so he's still not in the square yet he is not okay then I am going to ready my bow with an arrow as soon as he gets in the Square and I see the back of his head I want to take a shot at the back of his head nice and Sebastian what do you do Sebastian so the lord commander has thrown down a rope yeah the Lord Commander okay Sebastian runs to where the Rope is he doesn't climb up yet but he grabs the rope and he looks up and he says one moment okay and then he gets ready as well for the lord of the feast to enter the arena okay are you ready in a specific action if the lord of the feast actually so I'm gonna just a little bit away from there if the lord of the feasts gets close to me I'm going to thunder step okay nice next up is the lord of the feast and the shooter go on the same term [Laughter] [Music] the Lord of the feast rushes into the square as he does so he throws his longsword his and as he rushes for he's dropped his longbow and he's picked up his flail once again and is swinging it over his head and he's taking up his shield as well as he comes into the square two things happen the hooded lanterns cry out now and they wheel out from the sides of the barricade yes like shooting boom a dog in a cage that was that made me sad when I said it and they turn and as they say commander look commander there's a large group of nose coming down this other way they're gonna crash against the other side of the barricade and the Lord Commander Allah says get back onto the tops shoot them from up above it'll be like shooting fish in a barrel mmm and the the hooded lanterns get pushed the barricades back and look like they're ready to jump up the ropes to get back up onto the rooftops out of the way but a large group of knowles is gonna be coming down from from that route as well is he close enough that I Thunder step he is close enough to trigger your Thunder step yes in my arrow and your arrow yeah so as the barricades move into place and the Lord of the feast barrels down towards me and Pluto I look at Pluto and I go you got this bud what I didn't hear anyway it was really loud I just like snap my fingers and there's a sudden explosion without listening for your response I just hope you have this and I'm going to thunder step up there okay there and the lord of the feasts in the chuva need to make constitution saving throws the chuva succeeds by a lot and the lord of the feast i gets a 10 nice alright so free damage 20 damage nice Dada Dada Dada Dada alrighty and the Shiva takes a half that cuz it's thunder okay the Shuba okay great now with my shot because they don't know where I am do I get advantage you do have advantage oh yeah yep so I shoot the lord of the feast in the back of the head with a 19 that is a hit as the arrow sings for the Lord of the feast just catch a side of it and tries to turn his shield to block it but it's too too short and it comes in just under his collarbone nice 28 damage nice barks out and as he does so he's getting some template he swings the the mace around on his reach he has the mounted combatant feet and his mount is larger than you so he has advantage on his attacker it's pretty big but you're dodging so they can select I thank goodness okay so here come the attacks of the Lord of the feast first the flail of madness gets a 22 two hits wail of pain gets a 15 - hits in the flail of paralysis gets a 13 - hit okay so the three years by the flail madness which is joke's on him which does 15 points of bludgeoning damage and I need you to make a wisdom saving throw you know what I will 15 damage we and they said I wanted to get resilient wisdom you said your favorite thing is failing wisdom seems right I get an 18 surprisingly okay you are good you do not have to make Malia's hat melee attacks against a random target on your next turn you're all good okay okay I'm really mad because I'm standing right in front of them okay next up is the pack they come rushing down the road they will be reaching the barricade next turn next are your allies they take positions and several of them begin firing at the Lord of the feast a hail of arrows comes out from the hooded lanterns and the others many of the other hooded lanterns on the rooftops over there though have turned their attention to shooting towards the pack of nulls that is rushing towards them so there are gonna be three shots against each of them from the rest of the hooded lanterns that's good we want that we want them to do with the nulls yeah unfortunately none of the hooded lanterns arrows are able to penetrate the defenses the lord of the feast but the chuva is hit twice yes nice and it takes 14 points of damage from the from the hail of arrows from the hooded lanterns meanwhile the silver order is holding their position at the south and they they blow their war horns a signal that more Knolls are approaching from the south as well so they're going to hold the position from the south to next the executioner down there by yourself there is what's that sound the sound of smoke the smell of smoke and the sound of wrenched metal fills the air as the Lord of the feast locks eyes with the executioner it takes out its matte its massive acts like hand and its pincer like fists its body lunges forward smashing the cart in front of it out of the way as it lumbers 30 feet towards pollute Oh as it does so it cries there's a crying of a cry of caning metal as de Spectre the corpses on its body reach forward and a cloud of specters emanates out these wailing visage is coming forth from its body as the horrific spirits of the Dead emanate from the executioner a chorus of voices the last words of the executioner's victims you've got to help me cry out the horrified anguished spirits that appear in a chorus around it and I'm but I'm like wearing my helmet so I'm like not so worried about spirits spirits coming nobody said the ghost could come up here ghosts can fly fly forward and out about a dozen of these spirits fly out towards the hooded lanterns and basically there's one spirit that that flies almost towards everybody as if each soul has chosen its mark and they lunge towards the assembled hooded lanterns one and one against each of you crying out for the justice that they never got they they reach out towards each of you pollute oh I get an eleven against your AC Oh Sebastian I get a fourteen against your AC shield and veo I get a 15 against your AC yes okay now you are hit for seven points of necrotic damage and you need to make a constitution saving throw 14 you're good you're hit point maximum is not reduced the Lord Commander is hit and the Lord Commander takes 15 points of necrotic damage Wow and he succeeds his Constitution saving throw the hooded let the hooded Lantern behind you besides you there Sebastian is hits and the spirit reaches out into the hooded lantern piercing it and as it pulls into its body the spirit of the hooded lantern is pulled out of its body and as is necessary false or the ground another its own spirit is pulled out of its body as well is gonna ghost you up here the lord of the feast is attacked by one of the spectres and so is the Shiva the Shiva is hit and the chuva takes another 15 necrotic damage as well does it have a spirit bond with a new ghost friend and the chuva actually fails its constitution saving throw and so it's hit point maximum is actually reduced by that okay well okay good good okay it's a very clean even spirits the spirits do not have favoritism okay so with that we go to the top of the round with pollute oh so everything's fine everything's totally fine there's a mace wielding maniac in front of me there is a spirit trying to steal my soul and there is a giant mechanical corpse machine coming up behind me yeah I think I've waited long enough so I'm going to action surge I'm going to Dimension Door to beside Sebastien on the rooftop so I just I go and Pluto vanish and my cape and I'm gonna dimension and then I'm gonna start whaling on these spectres if you know what I mean oh-ho-ho getting a like 29:32 hit that is a hit for 11 damage cool on the on the new ghost friend it is still standing as your as your what are you using your sword or spear my spear the magic of the spear tears into its ethereal body leaving it bloodied and then I'm gonna try to attack it again and I get a 22 hit also hit for 12 damage the spirit dissipates destroyed sent back to whatever realm lies beyond so I'm kind of trying that now I'm imposing myself between and I'm gonna can I shove this thing um are they are they they fly are they like real enough to shove you can try I'm gonna try I get a 24 I get an 11 I get a 16 in Roland minus 5 so it shoved so I'm just pushing it back and trying to keep that ya pace between us get back back to it yeah yeah Vail you're up um so I even though I have this specter behind me I'm like ghosts and I take two shots at the Lord of the feast okay you do so with disadvantage because the enemy is within 5 feet of you is it it yes it appeared right behind you what I'm gonna do is as a bonus action I'm gonna use Zephyr strike nice just a pawn it does not now zapper strike and I'm gonna take my shot with advantage because it's a free strike oh good thing um 24 or 25 no 24 to hit that is a hit well guess the load of the feast 27 damage that leaves the lord of the feast bloodied I take my second shot at him no miss that one and I'm gonna run across the rooftops as far as I can which way I using my feelin agility so I can go all the way to the edge oh that way other way yep you just might have to move one of the the posts okay perfect and I kind of half crouched ready to go okay next up is Sebastian Sebastian runs up to Pluto thanks for saving me hey I'm look I just want to make sure that you're okay and I shove him back into slaughter stone square polymorph on him so as I'm thanking him I shove him off the bridge okay and as he's falling I reach out my hand and these black tendrils shoot out of my hand and start wrapping around Pluto and he lands in the form of a shadowy t-rex as I'm transform my last words are in infernal I'm not trapped in here with you you're trapped in her Worth and I am now a big beast monster okay bad works and then I cower alrighty the lord of the feast howls out at the situation and he turns spinning his flail in the in the air and he comes around towards the dinosaur and he's going to attack the dinosaur with his flail of madness getting a 15-2 hit I am do you have it really there it is I have a 13 Armour okay so he hits your t-rex form for 14 points of bludgeoning damage okay and you need to make a wisdom saving throw twice t-rex you can do it I get a 12 you fail and on your next turn you will make a melee attack against a randomly determined foe if there's no one within your reach you will attack randomly I am a loser action sorry I've gone primal okay the lord of the feast edges forward and he tries to get his flail of pain towards sebastian getting a natural one oh it smashes against the cart right at my feet and then digs up with the flail of paralysis getting a 25 to hit that one hits I get smacked right in there no no Sebastian you take 10 points of damage and I need you to make a constitution saving throw against the paralysis eight you are paralyzed and your concentration ends that didn't go well at all that I thought I was and the Shiva lunges towards Pluto high now was I mad as a t-rex or as a man you are mad as you were mad as a t-rex but the affliction stays with you okay the Shiva rushes towards you Pluto hello my game with its bite hi getting a critical hit I don't take crits but I still accept the damage the tail Stinger gets a 17 to hit that misses thankfully don't take critical hits right because your armor which is good because this would have been 40 10 would have been 8d 10 on a critical hit so from the Shiva you're gonna take six points a piercing day Oh ouchies ouchies so that he's based with me now yeah the shuva and the lord of the Feaster based with you the shoe isn't the lord of the yeah yeah i'm shaking my head at the situation not at you okay the t-rex are supposed to be the most epic okay it got shut down very quickly because you're paralyzed with that your your allies the the Lord Commander turns to you Sebastian says what did you do you why did you let him go back down there you're an idiot and so the Lord Commander turns to the the spectre that's be beside him and he drops turns to one of the hooded lanterns throws his rope that back down and he leaps down to grab pollute oh and pull him back out and as he does so and and so he leads down to the ground taking an attack of opportunity from the specter which misses with a natural one yeah he grabs Pluto and yells who the hooded lanterns on the ground pull and they lift him up and in the process the lord of the feast makes an opportunity attack against the lord commander hitting him with the flail of pain and the lord commander takes 40 points of damage thirty bit psychic and ten bludgeoning and pluto as you see the the wound go into the Lord Commander you see him wince in the psychic pain of the blow but the weapon didn't hit him directly but didn't penetrate his skin no sword didn't miss magic is he magic maybe maybe it's our friend maybe it's the queen or maybe you just took a potion a special potion I want to use as I'm being carried away like a baby mm-hmm I want to use Sentinel to attack the Lord of the feast with my chin with my javelin because he attacked my friend okay go for it and baby I get a 22 that hits and I want him using my last superiority dice to make a strength safe I get an 8 he is not prone okay he falls from the Shuba and his lands prone on the ground and he takes 11 damage 1213 damage okay goodbye the executioner races towards the prone Lord what we wanted I say paralyzed raises his his axe up over his head putting his second hand on the axe and brings it down on the Lord of the feast making his attack with advantage scoring a critical hit okay so you guys can roll the damage he the the Lord of the the the executioner yeah deals 3d8 bludgeoning plus 3d10 to chronic damage so all of that is doubled on the crit so someone do the the d8 sand someone do the D tens 8 3 D 8 doubled 68 oh no I have enough days and you do the detents so six of each rain and they go by [Music] okay 23 on the d8 okay hmm it's a satisfying hmm it's a couple of nines there oh god that's gross I got 53 beheadings the Lord of the feast I rolled three tens two nines he brings a backswing up on the shuva again the same amount of damage yeah why did I even bother there's nothing more rewarding than throwing a bunch of really big dice to see how much damage we can do and then try to break that record with this current roll 32 on the d8 40 and then slicing the schewe in half great did it work the bloodied remains of the decapitated Lord of the feast and the bisected chuva splatter across the ground of slaughter stone square on the shiva and the keening wail and smoke of the metal of the executioner abates in a moment as the spectres fly back towards the bodies of the Lord of the feast and the shuva and pull the spirits of them from the bodies as they stand up and then turn to look at all of you as the spectral form of the Lord of the feast swings a spectral flail what no no we cheered though well did we did we make a mistake Ron doesn't quite a slaughter son squarey right right this is all new territory currently I don't really have a spectral version of those so you can just put their miniatures back oh good the spectral lord of the feast holds the flail in one hand and its spectral head in the other and the the bisected Shuba just kind of lumbers forward like two spectral halves towards the gate as the the Noles crashed towards the the barricade clamoring towards it the lord commander looks back at you and says I didn't see that one coming yeah this is whoops paralyzed the talking around Pluto what are you gonna do I'm gonna shoot the black flare yeah just the one shot I and then can I pick up Sebastian yeah and I'm gonna just jump and run seeing the black flare the Lord Commander says he grabs his horn pulls it at where the the weapon hit him and he says yeah I think running is probably the best idea now Retreat retreat yep guys what Square right and I'm trying to like wake Sebastian up so I'm like cool giving him like I'm just a Oh what are you gonna do I am going to cast fog cloud on the middle of them okay so they can't see but I'm gonna cast it as uh Oh guys there's the first level spell okay lot and then I I motioned to them and I point towards the way we came rather than the Lord Commander says we can't go back to what that way the nulls are coming from that direction rendezvous at the clock tower so I start to make my way across towards the clock tower across the room the horns of the silver order blare out as they begin abandoning their fortified position the Noles crashed through the Gateway after in the next next round and the executioner begins slaughtering them and the Lord of the feast spirit as well as the Noles take a moment to realize what is going on before droves of them are slaughtered and turn into spectral knowledge spirits hovering around the executioner Sebastian the paralysis ends Oh happened did we win where where are you all going to go yeah I'm gonna I'm I'm making sure that the retreat is going successful but yeah heading towards the I just imagined with the fog cloud all we're hearing is like these Knowles being slaughtered but we can't necessarily see them like oh good thing I did that I didn't want to see that mask you so much cover our escape so running towards ya continuing across the rooftops towards the clock tower okay weaving in and out of houses and stuff with Sebastian under my arm [Laughter] several of the hooded lanterns break off and head back towards the barracks a few more assist with the retreat the silver orders horns blare and it sounds like they're retreating back towards temple gates with the chaos of the ravening Knolls the battle at slaughter stone square abates itself the fighting and the howling continued for a few more hours and you make your way back to the clock tower well that was fun was like I shot so many things can you guys explain what just happened for the non-initiated magic guy like what what what was that I turned you into a t-rex I blacked out and I assume you won the battle for us well I'm pretty sure the executioner he takes the souls of people he kills we didn't did we know that did we kill the executioner nope oh and he killed the Lord of the feast and chuva yep and now they're spectre people but part of him but he doesn't leave slaughter son square so he's even more powerful so we just gave him like a huge upgrade yeah yes super spirits now yeah and he just killed like a bunch of nulls you know that sign that we saw like her first time going into Dragon hime that said don't go to slaughter stone Square and then what did we do listen to it we went there we wise but it served its purpose I will did anybody else follow us back to the Clocktower is it just the Lord Commander and several other hooded lanterns including Ansem and the Lord Commander Lord Commander you took a hit I'll be fine it's nothing mmm you don't even look wounded I said I'll be fine it's the badge isn't it sure Ansem that was a great shot and I go to high-five him he high-fives back yeah I immediately walk up to the Lord Commander and start like looking in his eyes and like checking out I'm like looking him up and down what's what's going on he says I might be an old dog but I still got a few good tricks up my sleeve dog anyway set.you does the wink look familiar no okay thank you for saving my friends let's just put it this way you don't survive ten years of Civil War and five years of fighting in the streets of Drac and I'm if you don't know how to take a few hits this is true fair enough we lost Virgil that's a shame he was a good man he was all right and and flame keeper Hannah is missing in action but we saw her in a bad place mm-hmm the biggest threat to Cathedral Square is dead it might be a little while before we can do anything about slaughter stone square but fortunately it doesn't have the strategic value in the city itself that the Cathedral does and it's not saying we can't use it the same way again in the future this could be our new to admit I don't like the idea of doing that what if all the people that this thing those are just a problem we're gonna have to solve again later yeah that's for future dragon for us to deal with now I'm tracking for us we dealt with a major problem I think it's a win my chest hurts a back in the day I'm bleeding this thing has gone completely haywire whatever's happened the executioner we used to be able to control it with the badges but it's clear now that something has happened to it and I don't think we're ever gonna be able to control that thing again one day we're gonna have to destroy it and I don't think we have the resources to do that that thing could have killed all of us yeah it almost killed us once we might have to we might have a way of destroying it we might need to talk to the amethyst academy yeah maybe they can tell us like who made it what do you know of its origins was it made by it was it constructed by the city was constructed by someone else for the city I'll be honest I don't know I just knew that we it's been here in Drakon dying for generations I think it was a gift by the dwarves to one of the old kings probably even before the Vaughan Castle dynasty it's an insane machine it was a terrifying machine units in its day but whatever's happened to it I like going look at one of the windows just to make sure it's not coming for us and hasn't left slaughter stone square you look up from the perch in the clock tower you can kind of spy it maybe one of you has a spyglass it's sitting right back down on the edge of the cistern and the spirits have dissipated the Noles are fleeing back into the city streets the disparate war bond limping and whimpering broken without the strength of the Lord of the feast to bind them together so what now we can now infiltrate the cathedral yeah but I think we need a bit of a rest before we do that yeah cuz I mean I'm not hurting too bad actually if we take if we can now secure the cathedral we can then move on our like we can at least organ I know it might be a little bit before we're ready for a full attack but this could be an opportunity mm-hmm and getting the amethyst Academy involved and we're likely gonna need to figure out some way to destroy this this thing and if I could do an aside with dragon force outside of the Lord commanders reach you want to go upstairs to our bedroom all right yeah we have to go to all go to the bathroom at the same time check out my pigeons I'll check them at the end yeah I'll check on my bath I need to go up all right me and my men are gonna camp out down here do you have food provisions supplies here do you have food we don't have much with us we have a bit is it all right well rest here for the night make our way back to the the barracks in the morning and then we can make our plan for a strike against the cathedral again hopefully the war bands have dissipated was there anyone else there there was another Knoll looked like a priest of some sort yeah an ole priest sick resurrected the shoe busting she had a name what was the name that she although in I remember the name that came in at the moment no table it has name in it and it seemed to be if I had to take a wild military guess I think it was in charge of the Lord of the feast hmm it's probably gonna be happy they didn't look as big as the Lord of the feast they were a healer they were a priest so magic some sort of had a higher rank commander style jazz not looking forward to facing her or it I'm gonna see the wounded and see to yourselves as well you're all looking quite hurt yeah yeah we got hit by flails I took a flail to the chest there's it there's a it hurts it's it's sore I do have some rations if you need it for your men - what are your favorite foods they'll take whatever you can spare they persist the there they're not picky I take their rations I give them about three for four uh given for rations and I make it taste like the best roast beef they've ever had with my prestidigitation they're handsome over I got you guys backs they head back up to the loft of the clock tower looking out onto the city as the clouds part for a brief moment as the Sun begins to go down for the night that was insane that was amazing but we describe in detail what happened when Sebastian was paralyzed yeah it was really cool up until the part where he came back as like a Spectre thing yeah yeah that sound I'm sorry I missed it I had like this list of ideas you know the firewall circle fireball the Noles I in capital letters it says Pluto turns into t-rex we win that didn't go the way I imagined it I still turned into a t-rex and we did when we still won and I viewed well and worked and as usual Sebastian Crowe Landmaster mayo shot so much so much damage where did you go you fell off your horse and I looked back and you weren't there and then you were sniping I took a potion of invisibility did what I do best snuck in so cool and got on a roof Pluto what did you want to talk to us about so I didn't want the Lord Commander to here but I think I know how we can destroy the slaughter stone golem is it a bomb it's a bomb yeah we probably need to talk to the Queen she's not gonna give it up just to kill this thing's it could be a mutually beneficial so we either need to convince the queen of Thieves to give us our bomb back or we need to go to the amethyst Academy admit that we lost the bomb and but if we tell me laws that you think they're gonna give us another one but no I promise I won't lose this one they could they could blow it up though I mean the only thing is if we tell the queen of Thieves about this guy and she wants to take it over as her own pet like she did the t-rex then we have a big problem maybe we need to know more about it yeah before we do anything do you think there's information in the Tower well maybe we got to find the history like go through the history books Sebastian does your mom's Journal have any mention of the my mom's journal is mostly just spells doesn't tell me a whole bunch she has some notes in here but about the is there anything in there about the slaughter stone square or the if you want to spend some time studying at this evening perhaps I'll help I can read we might learn as well is it elven yeah it's all in elven yeah I mostly just stare at it I'm gonna go check out my pigeons because it's been a while and they probably need some seed or something okay yep your pigeons are very hungry they're fed so you're gonna feed your pigeons and take care Pluto what are you you're gonna I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna start to study the clock tower itself I want to get more more info from the the what do they call the mode runs yeah I'm going to start to look at them more closely there's some sort of connection with the clock tower and the event and it means it's at least something I can do while we're here in Sebastian Sebastian goes to the rainwater basin again he lights a candle he minor illusion some nice music playing he pours herself a glass of wine and sits down with his book and the bath cool innately yes Pluto you can give me a insider perception check or if you want to use your ability your Battlemaster ability to study them Oh in Sebastian you can give me an account a check with advantage to see if I learn new spells from the book or to see if I learn anything on the book ok 24:25 oh ok that was ok I rolled in nineteen I have plus five so as you're studying your mom's spell back here you are starting to look you you start to flip ahead to some of the other rituals in there that you don't yet have this go for and you notice that two of the pages are stuck together and as you pry them apart you can see that there is written in elven an expanded set of instructions around the spell contact other plain and it says as you pull the pages apart my dear Sebastian if you're reading this follow these instructions when you have the power to do so signed your mother just soak it in soak it in I walk up to his bath and I go that's my drinking water and I touched the water and I chill it using prestidigitation so is bathing in all their drinking yeah I cast Firebolt into the water and we go back and forth I'm just like chill we're gonna end up fighting here stop it you're more drinking water depressive did you two even clean it afterwards you know how to do that that's actually a really good idea and I slink away back to my kitchen the as you read back over the the rest of the book this specific ritual described here is an expansion of the spell contact other plain and well you don't fully understand all the components of it yet you're not high enough level to master this your mother's personal room plays a prominent role in the ritual for contact for this variant of contact on a plane it might be designed to contact her directly no no no what guys what hey I get out of the bath so I'm standing there but just finished reading this book so there was a secret pate oh sorry where's the water chilly it went back and forth a minor illusion some blurred out there we go guys there was two pages stuck together in the book mm-hmm was it gum no it was my mother hiding secrets I mean that's not anything I might be able to get in touch with her but I need to research this further that's new yeah you can talk to your mom I'm not yet where do you need to look up research for this don't know I just I just read this I just really wanted to share it with you guys this is a big deal I'm having a little bit of a panic attack right now I drink a lot of wine I go over and I start like rubbing your shoulders just like my cat fingers I'm like settle down it's all my eyes I'm a towel I curl in a ball on the floor put a tongue around a drape a towel over you okay thanks man okay thanks for the cat scratchies you're on them where do you think you need to go next to figure out how to talk to your mom the towers kind of have something the tower has to have answers I know that that's that's what they said is that the tower would have answers about my mother and I I might be able to contact her what do you need to do it what do I need to do it it was it mentioned her wound um you would need the components and the skill to cast the ritual contact other plain guys I just need I think we should go to the tower at some point because that that's really important mm-hmm and I think I just need to keep practicing magic I don't know if I can do this yet but the more I'm using my magic the more powerful my Magic's getting and I think my mother just needs me to take a little bit more time to hone my skills this close now speaking from like just what we've encountered could you potentially could this just be a demon trick because you are reading a demon book thing it's my mom's book yeah she also loved talking to demons and I need to figure out more about that yeah yes it could be a trap yeah you know what else everything in this damn city is a trap Pluto Jackson it's true so we're just gonna yeah I guess we can just we just kind of we walked into a mirror dimension after information from my mother you think I'm gonna get in the mirror dimension might have something yeah but the amethyst Academy took that mirror away we have to go we are nervous I need to go talk to them yes we need that mirror we need to figure out what's in the tower and River was trying to find out answers and she sent me to the tower she said that that's where I need to go to for answers hmm I think that needs to be our next stop after this we journal after the Cathedral it would mean a lot to me guys if we could hit up that tower it makes sense just a quick in-and-out just 15 20 minute venture 20 20 minutes tops don't say it what's the worst that can happen don't say yeah yeah um you know I think this is it's leading us there it's leading us to the next step and I feel like if we can figure out more about the Academy and maybe we can bring them closer to a treaty with other factions the time to hesitate is through Pluto grab me my pants I can't find them no what did you remember when you used to tell him to grab your pants okay remember wow we've all grown up so much so much what do I learn anything from the mode runs what did you get on your insider a perception check I their both before I got a seven but is there a way I can leverage knowing my enemy yes them if you recall there was a there is the blasted remains of a larger motor on amongst the group of them the motor owns here seem like they are trying to conduct repairs but they are lacking the the way that they're operating is like a bunch of soldiers that don't have a commander and it seems like whatever the command structure of these motor runs is these low-level grunts are not even given an idea of what they're suppose to be doing it's all filtered through their commanding officer or whatever that creature was so while they are trying their best they literally don't know what to do and they're just repeating the same routine that they were doing before it would seem to be that if there was another if there was a creature that they recognized as a commander that was giving them orders they would simply follow those commands hmm we have a missing puzzle piece here I lost a lot of men when I came to tracking Heim I believe it is my duty to lead these robots into glorious battle or at least prepare repair sounds better I don't know if they're much use in a fight I'm gonna go in to drill sergeant mode I had some really really good drill instructors in my day who taught me fencing and riding a horse and yelling quips and and like and III go and I go all right listen up and I and I'm gonna start grabbing them and putting them into different formations and trying to force them into like kind of whipping them into shape okay throughout the night your efforts are largely in vain until in the wee hours of the night finally one of the mowed Ron's turns to you and simply goes one one and then it goes back to what I was doing before I can talk to them I pop my head down what I heard you gasp I'm just so tired you woke me up with your gasps okay I was listening the whole time I was upstairs listening I think I've started to make contact with them yet you're standing in a room with them all around you it's working are they fixing the clock I'm basically the jane goodall of of moe drunks I live with them now I am one of them and I'm saying all this and I think I'm saying in English but I'm saying in ones and zeros zero one zero zero one one zero zero I'm going here randomly saying numbers at them and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't you would need but you realize that what whatever you've said to that one motor on that combination of zeros and ones was the command for attention soldier and so with more time you might be able to learn the motor on language and I will be the leader of the mode rods are they made from the same did they have very similar features to the executioner not at all so it doesn't look like they come from like a common ancestor or something okay yeah you could studying them you can say conclusively that whatever constructed the execution or whatever constructed these things are of completely different origins okay good to know with that the night passes I sleep curled up in a ball and as the morning comes the hooded lanterns are downstairs they've taken their breakfast and patched up their wounded and it looks like already some of the hooded lanterns have left but once you get up the Lord Commander is still there and he is speaking with one of the Squires of the silver order a cadet woman who has given him a sealed scroll bearing the seal of the knight commander what's it say it's just an update they the knight cut the the night captain and the high flame keeper have retreated back to temple gate and are heading back to their encampment to reconvene they've got quite a lot of wounded many of them are exhausted it's been a lot of battle for for them all they've asked us if we're capable of moving ahead to take the cathedral itself and we've scouted it out there's still a few Knowles there but there's not much resistance right now it seems like many of the Noles have gone feral they're attacking anyone in the streets but they're completely disorganized and have scattered on her uh Turley there's still a few that are camping out in the cathedral but it should be enough for us to take them too out now how is the gate doing the gates holding nice well just so happens I just put a bandaid on my chest wound and I am ready to go back into the fray how are you guys I healed up nicely after a nice rest and a night of yelling zeros and ones yeah did you have a nice rest you were up most of the night I like tried to get to sleep but you kept I kept hearing you being like zero one zero one one zero and I'm like way it was like 3:00 a.m. man I've must admit it's been a while since I've been here to the clock tower you wouldn't mind if I came up and took a look from above I've never had that kind of vantage point over the city before it'd be really great if a few of me and my Scouts could get a look up there maybe update some of our maps yeah I would say so as long as you don't touch any of my stuff do not touch the Moe John's the motor oh don't worry about it you'll see the money what was the first thing you said to me when we met he thinks actually I actually personally as Monty I don't remember the Lord Commander would okay but I don't remember does he respond to me with the right answer what what's the answer you're expecting I don't I don't know either yes okay what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to test him because like I don't want this to secretly I don't trust anybody not being the queen of thieves at any given time so I start bombarding him with like questions about our like history mm-hmm like just naming them off like what what did I think of Ansem the first time that I met him so how's your old dog over he he answers affirmative lead to those questions yeah like it's he kind of reveals herself I know but he winked at me earlier and I was like confused a little by it and I just I don't want to invite somebody into our like place where we're doing all of our research all of our planning our home and it could be the queen of thieves like I just don't want to do that so it was just a test I'm being I'm taking precautions thank you Lord Commander I just can't let anybody upstairs don't touch anything you're in my house now you're in vales house now yes technically speaking you are squatting on the rightful property of the king squatter's rights I've been here for like 15 years Lord Commander we've gone over this until Drakon home is reclaim this is kind of where we're operating out of so until such a time that we need to give it back to the city which we will man sex yeah this is where we're all that's fine you do so because of your service to the city it's fine but just remember that once this place is retaken maybe it will actually repair this old tower I don't know maybe we can figure out a deal with somebody and if you want to take the old place over maybe one day we can arrange that I mean once the cities are reclaimed I'm probably gonna buy a farm just outside you know settle down the Lord Mayor and the steward used to be the ones that handle all the real estate in Drakon Heim Oh dad you know maybe have kids yeah maybe not he did do a great job find a knight I have to admit you ionized her and I often didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things you know I felt like many times I felt like I had to beg my way past him to talk to the king it really frustrated me mm-hmm and it seemed like you know Yohan had a good head on his shoulders he was very very organized but man did he like bureaucracy yeah I feel that um he was a strong man to deal with but I think he respected the order of the king the monarchy and I think having a little bit of that right now in Dragon hime is not the worst kind of thoughts so if we can keep what he believed alive I think jaqen home will be okay we've won a real big victory here the silver order was a great set of allies for us but we've got a lot of problems still in the city if we want to retake it and we want to get a lot of order happening around here the silver order has asked me a few more things this is a letter from the high flame keeper a philia read and it's following the words of the hierarch of the sacred fire there is supposed to be a diet held back in Illyria in a week or so regarding those pilgrims they're coming to the city following Lucretia Matthias apparently she sent a bunch of her own representatives to attend this diet and defend her because apparently this whole thing with them is triggering crisis of faith the silver order has asked me that if necessary would I be willing to help them arrest her hmm arrest her with plans to question her and keep her safe or arrest her with plans to execute her that's all going to depend on the results of the diet depending on what Lucretia Mathias is representatives say what the hierarch says normally if one of these things were called we would expect a royal representative to oversee it as a neutral arbiter there's nobody neutral there's no Royal Assent to decide whether or not the people that follow this new set of beliefs or the old ways are the correct ones isn't that why we're headed I think I've uh I've got some status behind my name do you think I could oversee or no is it are they looking for royalty within dragon time seems like a whole kangaroo trial to me right now as far as I'm concerned it seems like they're taking advantage of the fact that there is no royalty to act as a neutral arbiter over these proceedings whenever there's been a crisis of faith in the past there's many different denominations of our faith all of us worship the light in a different way but never before has there been such a large protest against the hierarch that's what this little thing is becoming Lucretia Mathias is claiming that the authority of the traditional flame keepers is meaningless hmm one thing that came up for us as we were coming across the new followers is they're they're pretty radical they're not easy to shake I think the lanterns hooded Lantern should be careful about stepping into such orders as riling them up by taking their leader may cause more trouble than we have just having them in the city I know but you need to know that even amongst my soldiers there's two things that keep most of them going their faith and their loyalty to the nation and for a lot of them this whole talk of an Age of Heroes it's very inspiring for them especially being so close to it I've even had a couple of my own people desert the lanterns and go off to join them directly it's happening to in the silver order we're losing people to battle but we're losing people in their hearts and minds like they are said before we need to destroy her the the leader of the cult of the falling fire the followers of the following volley fire we need to destroy her and and and and show people who she truly is how do we do that to get back their favor towards the that would require disprove that you like her religious beliefs how do we do that well I don't know if this is a wise idea but they believe that the Delirium is some sort of magical light that they put inside them they think it's gonna save them when they stab it into their chest hmm what if we show them what it can do what it's done to the Queen I mean I don't think the word of that is gotten out yet the Queen could be not only a way to bring down their faith but she could also be a potential arbiter mm-hmm to show them that and and he'll help us reinstate your faith your side of the faith I have to be honest with you both oh I don't know the what Lucretia Mathias says is wrong what if she's right what if she actually knows something about the delirium that we don't I mean I had plans to infiltrate to learn but you can't get through that front door of jamming a piece of delirium into your heart so we were stopped pretty short on that path I was hoping to learn as much as I could about them before making a final decision on them to see if they were on to something I don't I don't want to jam rocks in my heart none of us do not magical that's just further their highest level believers that's what there's so many people throughout the nations that are hearing this as a new gospel they believe it they don't need to jam a piece of delirium into their hearts to take that message to heart yeah but if we're gonna learn more about her then we need to get into her her base we need to figure out what she's up to we need to figure out what she's seen what she knows I have a copy of her book we we we said why I mean I've seen it she's got a lot of real objections to against the church itself you know there's the whole business that's been brewing for years about the fact that all the flame keepers are women there's so many more objections that people have to weigh the way the church handles money politics all sorts of things the fact that the hierarch is the de facto leader of Illyria all of those things are issues that they take up with them they don't need to be even deal with delirium itself to cause a crisis of faith and if more and more people are coming if the silver order doesn't like the way that these truck that these trials go we would have to travel weeks to even get there word could come down from the hierarch and our hands could be completely tied if the silver order comes to me and asked me to help them arrest her am I gonna say no I don't think you can say no but I think arresting her and what you do after you arrest her is a fine line I hear I hear your concerns but I'm wondering do you have a solution in mind you have something you're talking to the Drakon for Sears there's something that a small team is there something you want for this I don't know so I can confide in to about this that's fair I just I was wondering if you had any ideas on the way with that we could help because other than housing as followers and wait trying to fake our way in there and learn what we can and then tear it apart from the inside out or find something to to dismantle her maybe there's that where you're proposing because I just hired you know a Cornelius Mortimer Bigsby is good at infiltration whether need to prove them wrong or accept that we don't know anything and make a judgment on them the only other people that know anything about delirium about the truth of all this is the amethyst Academy they I can talk to I think it'd be interesting to see what they think of all this as well I agree we are supposed to have a meeting with the heads of the three factions we'll make the arrangements for it in the meantime hopefully things with the silver order won't boil over in the meantime I'm a little bit nervous about revealing the Queen publicly so are we because the silver order is not going to like what's happened to her we already know that a philia reed doesn't approve yeah but I wonder what their intentions are around not liking it is solely faith or what she can pose as a threat to their power in potentially being a ruler of Jack and I'm I don't know yet maybe we can save her reveal for if we get orders to kidnap hopefully read or to bring her to justice because you mean Lucretia Mathis registration Mathias yeah if we get if if it turns out that the face starts to break maybe she can be our wildcard to show people who what really happens when she's a last-ditch effort oh this is like what happens when you start to trust the Delirium we've been relying on the silver order for a lot of things though and if they're gonna help us stay true to Reese ank 2phi the cathedral I feel like we're committing to whatever they ask of us we're committing to them as long as they don't do anything that could pull track and I'm a part of the scenes alright maybe we should do it quickly with that then what's our plan for the cathedral square should be clear it shouldn't require too many people now to clear the rest of it out are the three of you going to take point on that yes yes yeah fine we will hold it while they perform the ritual we will bring only who's needed there are the vaults below the Cathedral there's going to be many important documents down there including most likely the last will and testament of all Drakon Castle I am trusting you three to secure those we want to see them too yes that's that's our prime objective we need to restore balance in dragon high alright here's the plan we're gonna go in take the Cathedral something's gonna be going on in the bowels of it if the Noles haven't gotten down there and used it as a den of some kind who else knows what's down there they'll probably press a second attack so me and my men will hold the upper levels well you get down there and secure things will clear things out well the Noles are continue to attack it make way for the silver order they'll philia Reed and her flame keepers will come in Andrey sanctify it and hopefully once all that's done we have the documents we need and the Cathedral will be another bastion of power in the city for us sounds good I like it when do we start as soon as we can recoup from the battle at slaughter stone square well we can go today or we can give you another day what do you need I think as soon as possible time is now aye-aye as long as your men are ready to go I've tapped out a lot of my soldiers make sense they've worked hard but I've got a few still left in reserve that are fresh same with the silver order we're ready to handle it alright breakfast sounds good always good yeah that's where we'll end for tonight that was so crazy what happened I thought I thought we were definitely taking out both of them tonight but the executioner got so scary so fast yeah it was it was that 180 I had no idea yeah did we know did we know and forget I know we didn't we knew that he had Souls I didn't know that he could gain more Souls because when we fought him last time we just escaped we didn't see him we just ran away I handle anybody and I I'm I'm sorry if I made an executive call but I thought there's no way we could fight that thing yeah no that's fair no that's good I don't think I think we need a little bit of help I'm sorry that I pushed you back in there turned you into a t-rex and then instantly got paralyzed seems like a bad play now that was great it was great it seemed really epic in my head and then it flipped and it wasn't I know it was sad amusing from BeOS vantage point my dear ex nope yeah the t-rex just got completely shut down yeah which happens sometimes I know um but yeah I think that was it was still so epic the chase fortify yeah you guys played really really well yeah so
