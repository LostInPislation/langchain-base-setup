[Music] Drakken dimers no more struck by a falling stone the city bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway car emits rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] good evening and welcome to Dragon hime this is our weekly Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition game with the dungeon dudes that's me Dungeon Master Monty Martin and I'm Kelley McLaughlin and I'm gonna be playing at Sebastian Crowe the half elf shadow sorcerer and we're joined today by my good friends Jill denied us playing Bayeux Sonya the tabac see gloom stalker Ranger and Joe O'Gorman playing Pluto Jackson the human battle master when last we left our heroes they had ventured deep into the ruins of the city indeed to the very heart of dragonhide the Market Square where the great astrological clock tower still stands silent for almost a hundred and eleven years this clock tower was once the sanctum of veo Senya r2 backseat gloom stocker and after a deadly battle against the harpies which had seized the clock tower and slaying the vicious harpy overlord known as the red dot our heroes have claimed the clock tower of dragon hime for their own this mysterious and ancient building its front facade marked not only just with the clocks that tell the time and date but the position of the celestial spheres and even the very planes of existence themselves inhabited by strange creatures that speak only in zeroes and ones on the lower level the upper area of the clock tower is now kind of the loft of our heroes and as you look out over the corpses of the red dot and her cockatrice pets the surviving pigeons which avail once kept up here and the great windows which overlook the city as the Sun begins to set and darkness takes over dragon hein you have a wonderful view of the entire city and indeed the whole lay of the land for miles around what do you do I look at it no shield your eyes beauty um well I think um well you well you're looking out the window I'm kind of like grabbing the dead corpses and like shoving them down through the door it's called the corpse hole now ya gotta put these in the corpse so if we're gonna live in here tidy up I mean do I throw them at the door do I put them out the window we just throw them off the edge do we have okay do we have like a bonfire on the lower levels I mean how far away is the big corpse machine can we throw them into the oh that's too far that's a little just a good throw Pluto grabs one of the cockatrice bodies Hudson make a strength jack 20 you Huck the body of the cockatrice and it's begins soaring through the air and it swings open up and it begins to glide forward that's how you throw a landing out of sight indeed as you look out over the city the the city itself as the Sun begins to set you can see the rooftops poking through the mist the streets of Drakon Heim itself from this high you can see just how much the haze chokes over the streets of the city here and there the tallest buildings in the city pop up through the mist giving you a pretty good sense of the way the streets are laid out but it's almost a twisted pattern like a broken mirror across the whole cityscape the mist recedes and hovers over the Grand River so you can very clearly see where the river is and you can look across and almost see that the mist CEL is almost pulling in the city walls like a thick pea soup and be but a pea soup that is being drained or swirling around a drain because as you look to the south you can see the great crater which is scarring the southern ward of the city this crater is impossibly deep because it only dives down into blackness even from this height looking down across the river and into the old industrial district of Drakon Heim how deepen this crater could be you cannot see the bottom as you survey the rest of the city you can see the remains of the Market Square the shattered Tower of the mage guild to the north and almost at eye level with the rest of the clock tower is the towers and spires of the castle the clock tower is not quite the highest building in dragon hunt the that honor goes to the mage guilds tower which is twice the height of the clock tower the castle though not as tall as the clock tower itself because it rests on the high hill in the cliffs rest higher geographically the clock tower itself does the other buildings that rival the clock tower in the height are the grand Cathedral of Saint matru vo several of the other chapels and churches throughout the city some of the other nobles estates and of course the tower the high watch towers around the city but it's an amazing vantage point and you think looking out as you look out into the distance you can even see amberwood village far in the distance you can see the Eckerman mill it's the spec but it's out there and another very curious sight between south of the Eckerman mill along the temple road leading into the city you can see what looks like a large encampment for me look almost looks like a military camp site great bonfires are burning in the distance there and it's powerful on the side of the river that doesn't bode well for things I've seen around the city where campfires lots of campfires together no I mean there's a lot of groups in the city uh I wouldn't worry too much about it maybe it's just a big fire I shouldn't have said anything I immediately uh goes back to looking at Ludo Jackson looking at it you see this it looks like a military encampment oh yeah that's just based on my experience being in the military and killing big things I can tell you that that's just a bunch of people in the military that's the military that over there right that can see it yes do you see it look look no look over here over there sorry sorry look at it I was looking at the crater no just watch and I was like no that's not okay sorry where are you pointing you oh yeah the camp fires that we were just talking about that one yeah okay that's military I know that because I was in the military thank you it's so very very much military around here means war and you know that's not necessarily a good thing oh I doesn't look like hasbi and military I mean Kyle do you have different types of fires from a military well it's not me so and I'm pretty much the Caspian military what about Jupiter oh yeah Jupiter darn Jupiter and now you bum me out oh sorry back it is Jupiter's Jupiter Jones encampment then the number of men that he had when you encountered him in amberwood village would have been but a fraction of his total forces judging by the size of this encampment there possibly over a hundred people could be careful how well can you communicate with your pigeon friends oh I can communicate with them pretty well could they do a flyby of that encampment I could yeah let's go talk to them so I I mean I should talk to them it's been a while since I've seen them stupid Birds um I walk over to the cage where my pigeons generally hang out and I'm like pesto come here they're cooing very loudly okay I don't need no attitude from you I get it I've been gone for a while sounds like you've been taking care of a little bit I mean missing a couple pigeons here so I'm sorry about your comrades but how many were there no need for that sass we had we had about seven or eight survived all right and I cast speak with animals and I talked to I'm gonna talk to squid he's the most intelligent one so what so this was amiable you're back did you bring food what do you think's great mercy brought food and I take a little bit of the ration that I had my feet up a couple crumbs of it the pigeons furiously flock towards the food scarfing it down at breakneck speed as pigeon learn what to do yes a short while later once they seemed satisfied although they keep looking like more MORE everyone's hungry in the city you'll get more squid but first I need you to do something for me I need you to take a fly bag of that you see those really bright lights over there and I bring them over to the window and I point he says yes all right tell me what you see and you'll get cheese and the pigeon flies out making for the encampment further away it's military you probably get under it will probably be a few hours before he gets back okay the rest of you have continued to stuff the bodies of the harpies down the corpse hole or off the corpse ladder as you throw them down to the lower deck you can hear the strange creatures down there go zero one zero one and you you hear them start to pull them away and throw them I actually I would love to go down to that floor and just like hang out with the zero-one people sure I just I'm just taking notes on the lower level with all the machinery there are several of these strange creatures that resemble spheres of metal with spindly little machine like legs and arms and little feathered wings and they have a large central eye that instead of being made of metal is made of flesh as are this porthole where their mouth is which is Oh an oversized fleshy mouth they have many monocles over their eyes there are several that look like two cubes stacked on top of each other instead and it looks like the cube ones after enough while you can see the cube ones are ordering around the spheres and judging by what they're doing it looks like they're trying to fix the clock tower and once in a while the cubes after about an hour several of the cubes go together up to that strange obelisk where the burnt-out pyramid looking one is standing and they go up to the pyramid and they start saying zero one zero zero zero one and standing at attention as if they're giving it a report and when it does and they stand there waiting for a reply for about half an hour before they shrug and walk back and continue bossing around the spheres no they've lost the commander I now have a plan to wear this pyramid at some point learn their language and I will become ruler as Vale and Sebastian tended to their menagerie what do you do pull it up I actually want to join Sebastian and I want to look for I want to just scour the room for like a manual or any type of documentation found in this machine area [Music] how you want to spend the rest of the evening searching around or I wonder like oh because I'm as interested as Sebastian how these things worry as interest maybe a pale in comparison yeah I wanna I want to see if there's like some old notes scribbled down the constructions it is late into the evening when you find piled up underneath some of the old furniture upstairs as you're tidying out bales area as well you find several old papers they're crumbling with age but it appears to be a stack of letters several of them addressed to the old clock master they're all written in the same hand and they are dated about 40 years ago and the letters reviewing them it take it it's a while to read through these letters so this is so this is the high level just that just because reading is hard for me or is it just generally there there's a lot of there's there's quite a stack of them the letters seem to catalogue an exchange between the clock master and members of the mage guild questioning why these creatures showed up about 40 years ago and trying to determine what they might be doing themselves explaining and there's one reply that says to the clock master see that this clock is powered by a mechanist chain and since the chain has failed these creatures known as motor ons have come to repair it but whatever's happened to their leader means that they might not be able to do it and the trailing letters explain that this is a little bit beyond the expertise of the current members of the mage guild and that it's just a clock basically and then the mage go the the correspondence ends with a little bit of passionless disinterest from what seems to be a representative of the mage guild saying we don't really care enough to fix this thing it's signed a variety of names the the last name that is signed on it and the majority of them that appear to have been addressing these letters seem to be coming from a woman by the name of Lenna 'the Eventide old lenin that's from the me children look at these look at these letters I read them all by myself and they're full of interest could i I thank you for getting us with this new information I could I head over to the triangle-shaped one and start I'd like to examine it to see what the level of damage on it is yeah are you reading the letters I he's reading them and giving me the gist of it I see it okay yeah he he lets you know what do you tell people what do you tell us about well it's pretty pretty complicated but this is a big clock tower go on and these guys here they're called mode Ron's prodrug Modi's for short Modi's thank you and they are trying to fix it gathered that yes now I'm looking at the dates here is it about 40 years ago poorly and by the looks of it the triangle one here was was in charge but he seems badly damaged who done it it's a whodunit is in the collected triangle up list does it have like somewhat of an eye like the other ones or no the AH ballistics itself no it looks completely different from the screen so triangle creature was reaching for the obelisk yes okay if I examine the triangle creature how damaged is it like it doesn't look like I might be is it better for 40 years do you reach out to touch it how do you examine it don't shoot it also trying to knock it away I touch it the points where you touch it disintegrates at your touch oh no I stopped touching it sorry it's uh judging again going by pollute Oh secondhand description of the letter it seems like these creatures showed up about 40 years ago the first one amongst them promptly exploded and they've been failing to fix the clock tower ever since well we'll leave that mystery for another day yeah what's what's gonna they really want this clock tower fixed now and I want to get to know these little things yeah but they've been here longer than all of us they just go about their business I kind of been ignoring them for years they don't seem to mind um where are we sleeping like you you have you have a nice bed well I mean you called bedfellow harpy feathers and probably could have kept the harpy fellows feathers to uses down actually this is important I did collect some of the harpy feathers because I do want to bring them back to my family okay but then we're also gonna make our way down the corpse hole and the winners let's find some of those hard feet with the supplies that veo has here and what the harpies had in their nests you can certainly cobble together some makeshift beds it's not comfortable but it's way better than a campsite I'll take it first order of business though is renovations and I would like a nice queen-size bed at some point with that do you all want to take your long rest now yeah okay and as part of your long rest you've also all attained fifth level so do we want to tell the stream what you've all gained with your new level up oh yes I gained oh ha so excited a extra attack so I now get to take two shots when I have the attack action on my turn and then I also got a spell called rope trick which I'm very excited to use this is a huge level ringers you get a second attack and second level spells yeah it's pretty good did you learn any other any other spells this level oh a key I did actually pass without trace okay Sebastian how about you so I got the ability to cast 3rd level spells and shockingly did not take the one I plan to take did you choose I was gonna take fireball but I was very interested in hypnotic pattern and thunder step ok thunder step is a favorite of mine recently and hypnotic pattern I've never actually cast before and I'm very excited to try it out because the implications of it are wonderous alrighty and I can hit things twice now I glitter Jackson has extra attack but I also found and while repurposed red dots javelin so I'm looking forward to throwing that like I do the chickens into somebody it sounds great the other find that you found the other find that you found so that is a javelin of lightning where the Red Dot got this thing from no idea it is a beautiful white oak javelin with a mithril tip Nancy sheep at least don't let let's be honest that's just and I saw and the on the side of it is engraved in elven the words lightning but as far as what the past of this might be and what this thing is not sure but when when you throw it and you hurl it and you say lightning in elven it turns into a bolt of lightning do you know what I saw let's say I'll spend a little bit of time and I sit down with you and I teach you the pronunciation of the word also seems very on the nose it's the you know it sounds lightning you say lightning and it anyway it's a very specific type of elven dialect though it refers to the lightning that specifically struck at the certain mountain in the world which is way on the other side of the world huge elven history it's very very subtle I mean how do you you know Alvin is a half-elf yeah but how do you how did you learn elven my mom but she died when you're right that's a plot point how did I learn how that is always good wait yes you must have learned it from the mage go yeah yeah this is really upsetting now now I'm trying to think of maybe you nursing my mom taught me wait certain languages I sought out to learn it because I wanted to read my mom's old journals to know more about her that's name and the majors guild helps me learn as well then it's relevant to to mention this this handwriting in some of these letters is your mom's all right I can't believe that you realized that I said it was signed Lenin Eventide you wrote it down wait did I you wrote down Levin oh my god I don't know that was your mom guys I forgot my own backstory no so rewind a little bit hey this signed by someone called Lenin theft it seems important now what what do you mean it was signed by those oh my god I recognize this handwriting anywhere I read her journals wait are the letters written in elvish or no no they're written in common okay what the handwriting is no name okay cool this is my mom hey why was your mom parted them gilt clock master I know she's part of the guild she was part of the killed I didn't I didn't know that dad has a meaning to do why didn't you tell you that your mom was part of the guild yeah well I mean to be fair the guild just kind of showed up and took me away and we didn't really talk about my mom much it was kind of not a happy subject in my household but I'm even thinking when we came back he could have been like hate the guild your mom I mean I would like to ask him about that but let's be honest there was a lot going on he hadn't seen me in 15 years more so than that but no one in the guild ever told you that either river has explainin to do this was a recruit at the same time as me we're the same so who's your Matt who is your master his name was elbrick Eldrick elder Kasim spleen yes plane there we got Rick out Rick has some explaining someone better we sighs is that how they Oh sighs explain is that no part of this on streets not only was my mum part of the mages guild but she was actively trying to get this clock tower repaired it seems well these the letters that she wrote unfortunately the very terse one saying like that she seems to be writing the bit the ones that are sorry we can't handle this for you anymore she was the dismissive one yeah this interesting but they're so interesting I about the Clocktower was it stuck what what was the planar ones that had stuck on like what's the time at and ammonium and limbo and Amorites between pandemonium and coz maybe that has something to do with when it stopped maybe we could figure out I mean I couldn't but you could I might be we might be able to ask that and they just killed and see if they know anything yeah like if there was somebody researching it maybe there's a conspiracy cover and potentially yeah or maybe it's just a boring clock tower it's also just could be a boring clock tower that stopped working and no one wanted to fix it like that's very much the tone of the letters towards the end and I I agree with your mom yeah this is boring the born clock tower well I'm interested and I'm more interested now do you mind if I hang on to these letters thank you mom memorabilia I don't have much I have her journal in these letters and that's about it and her elven words ever words truth her heritage but it's worth noting as well that not only did father never tell you your colleagues at the mage guild never told you nothing in the journals that you ever read mentioned her being a mage we done done them but I was seen as like everybody frowned upon my magical powers but she had them all the whole time and nobody thought to bring that up everybody was busy picking on me and beating me up and nobody decided to tell me hey you know what it runs in the family maybe nobody knew hmm just so many questions we should turn on detective mode I think she should have at least prepared your father for that possibility though maybe she did I don't think she planned to die in childbirth what if um what if your father doesn't even know maybe he doesn't it's very planing every somebody got us blame why do you guys say it like that it's x-plane picked it up from baya if it's any consolation the letters are dated about 40 years ago so well probably well before your parents secret history yeah I got some investigating to do so people's plane as the the evening passes well despite this interesting conversation if you have any more questions for me if you want to review I assume you spend some more time reading the letters a little a little bit more detail I imagine us like sitting around a little fire and I'm telling them stories about what I read in my mom's Journal what I remember about her which isn't much because literally she died in childbirth but you know I tell I tell her I tell them of the stories that I read about and the stories that my father told me periodically you just hear me mumble explain I want to do like a safety check of your tower like that like a like a routine like checking for pillars that will just fall where where there's ins-and-outs securing the facilities yeah like doing like you know my spot checks absolutely is there anything specific that you'd like to be watching out for that you'd like to fortify or like yeah like is there any easy access other than the doorway and our rope the windows go all the way up okay so flying creatures can easily access this building because it's all open and obvious ah right but from the ground that there's just the main set of doors there is an outbuilding that's attached to the clock tower there's a few outlying structures that are kind of part of the overall clock tower area and the part of the plaza that looks out over Market Square but by and large this is a standalone building I'm satisfied yeah I mean for years I didn't really have anything go on until I mean one day there was harpies when there wasn't but other than that I had a really good you know long run here without trouble and especially now that the bottom most staircase has been taken out by the bells it means that even getting up to the upper levels on foot requires rope and grapple hooks or some sort of ladder to be set from up above so if you pull that ladder up it without any access from the first floor to the second level gallery from the ground floor creatures would need to either fly or jump or run a run a rope or throw some sort of grapple hook to get up to the second level so that means that you'll have to use a rope to get in and out as well I'm ready to rest yeah okay mm-hmm the evening passes Sebastian has terrible nightmares just terrible nightmares he screams basically all night sorry guys does it is it annoying Cobras Cobras it sits in the middle of the night it's like oh that hasn't been destroyed and I just like stick it over are you smothering me [Laughter] [Music] no what am i what am I dreaming about your dream about being eaten by a horrible dog is it the dog that I've had nightmares about several times he's eating you okay sorry dog dog it's the Hound yeah he's in the dream you are being chased through your childhood home by this dog again and I'm crying for my mom at the end of the dream it catches you and drags you into the crater I wake that dogs got some splaining to kill me last night well I didn't really horrible thing but the dream is that the dog actually eats half of your body and then drags your still-living torso across the countryside before dumping you in the crater your spine yeah guys I had the dream again probably not eat before bed yeah that's probably it yeah yeah you give me your food before you do that I mean just cuz I was eating well sleeping doesn't doesn't mean that that's the source of my nightmares we've been with you long enough that I think we're the experts we even have your smothering pillow ready a padded rucksack you think back to the time that you criticize you criticize Sebastian's father for locking you in the basement but now you completely understand I don't know maybe you did try to use a pillow person got to a point where maybe you almost got smothered I'm just saying you need to be careful with the pillow approach because I can yeah you can sleep with the robots next time if you're gonna keep having nightmares sleep in the robots they're so loud oh yeah that must be annoying partway through the night you take him down to the robots and then in the morning you find that the robots have put him below thanks guys I'll just set up my bed three three levels lower I just have my night terrors no no no we just like you can breathe through your nose sleep breathe yeah this reminds me of initiation in the amethyst Academy anyways come the morning after making a small breakfast ride them up how big they're pretty big I only have two okay but if they're like are they bigger smaller than ostrich eggs they're like ostrich eggs this ostrich egg okay yes but we'll eat one I'm bringing this I'm bringing this one back but we make like scrambled eggs out of it so there's new for all of us terrific anyone's keeping a catalogue of the number of acts of cannibalism bit of a curtain I ever need many humans for the record are they half is half human still count heart bees like if we eat a harpy I guess that they're not human let's save this rate for the Internet no I am I also eat a little bit like I'm trying to savor it but a little bit of that candied salmon treat myself so it's not going bad yet as you finish your breakfast your pigeon friend returns and after having sex with animals again squid says where's my breakfast salmon if you found out deal anyways for you to give them the salmon we got tell me what you found out actually a little bit of a back and forth he divulges and says is Oh pigeon he sort of way he says there are many men wearing shining shining metal on their hats and they have very sharp swords and very very big pieces of wood that they're carrying on their arms and horses so many horses can you see colors we'll say yes yeah okay what colors were they they were in silver and gold hmm okay and did they look like they're preparing anything oh they were preparing dinner I got to eat a ton of bread it was great that's why I'm so late sorry oh I understand then one of them tried to eat me so I ran away oh good good yes we don't want them eating pigeon for breakfast and good job and I give him a little bit of the salmon yeah he says they had dogs they had horses and there were many men some women too and they had hats made of metal and big wooden planks and sharp metal talons and there were there were like more them then I've seen feathers fall off my wing there were so many mm all right well thank you thank you for flying out there I'm glad you got a little bit of a treat while you were there but I'm glad you're back safe and sound I miss you all right so after conversing with my fine feathered friend over here we have an army essentially it sounds like soldiers military military yeah for sure designated military wearing gold and silver who's that would I would I know what this sounds like this would be the silver order sounds like the silver order hmm politics hey I mean and whether they're just outside of their own amassing a long temple road the gate with the Noles I mean that could be helpful could be yeah I like paladins don't know why not I mean I deal in a lot of unholy magics at times and the Impala dents haven't always seen eye-to-eye on the way I go about my business they're a bit pushy I get that I've kind of come across them a couple times kind of seen the mountain streets they're not the friendliest Bunch yeah we're not we're not enemies exactly it's more just like we we just don't go about things in the same way fundamentals different yeah so conversations tend to be sometimes we're working towards the same goals but we tend to argue about how to get there is the main problem so it could be helpful if they take out a bunch of Knolls yeah I mean I guess they're just trying to make their way into the city and the Paladins one in the city question I don't know what they exactly want but it'd be good to find out the only thing that you know is that the silver order is the military arm the silver of the worship of the silver fire or the sacred flame and they are based in the neighboring nation of Illyria so this order is not of Drakon I'm their foreigners but the worship of the sacred fire was the dominant religion in Drakon I'm and there are many holy sites here in in the city maybe they're trying to stake their claim on Dragon I am seems in the fall of the city a bunch of neighboring countries countries cities neighboring yet trying to make their own marks sharpening my sword I think everybody's trying to stake their claim here in the city and you know some of us are just trying to survive but you know there's a lot of rivaling factions around can make things difficult for those hashanah survive well at least we own a small part of it now with your beautiful tower so now that you have staked your claim in the city what will you do next yourselves it might be worth making sure that like Pluto's got this idea that you know we can start to slowly make our way out around the tower you know clear with the buildings around it or oh you want to deal with the corpse collector yeah just you know just to make sure we have safety in the tower area explore a little bit it doesn't hurt but I think we also need to figure out a potentially way out yeah well our way into the city was not the greatest I don't want to have to go trudging through the sewers dealing with the fish folk and a giant mech mech mechanic or Mick Macker mech monster who is collecting corpses and almost murdered me by touching me with a soul so there's got to be a better way for us to get in and out of the city and I think if we can find that way it might be helpful well it's also great like I wouldn't stay here in the tower a long term though that's the only thing is as much as its above the city we're gonna run out of Shannon's pretty quick so we definitely need a way in and out to be able to resupply and have at least this as a place where we can come and go if we need to State University this is like our base when we have a mission inside the city but amber would village is much safer maybe it's like a campground it's like our favorite camping yeah yes fun okay how are you going to do that so we could go back through the sewers well I think what do we know okay here's here's some options that I'm seeing the Paladins of the silver order are seemingly gathering on temple road outside temple gate which is overrun with Knolls so that's a very dangerous gate to look at there is the the Shepherd's gate which is being commanded by the hooded lanterns which we still have an in with because we did save one of them who what was your name Petra Petra there is also we do we do technically have an in with champions gate right that's that's with the the cult of the Fallen cult of or they don't they don't like the word cult the only thing to be aware of with champions gate just just to survey the land if we pull up our map champions gauges to the south it offers the most direct access to amber would village however as moving between champions gate and the clock tower would require you to go right past the crater going down and that's the champions gate is a champions way so that's number five on your map the other gates at temple Road and Kings Road those gates are currently occupied by allegedly by monsters of some kind as is possibly as well the market gate all of them appear to be in control of some form of terrible creature the only gates that are kind of the only gift that's really reliably accessible is the champions gate which is controlled by the followers of the falling fire and the Shepherd's gate which is controlled by the hooded lanterns because that's where their barracks is so though so if you're looking for cutting a deal champions gate and Shepherds gate are your options the other ones would require if you're considering the other gates of the city none of those things are impossible just you're looking at a fight I think given the location of the crater although I am very interested in finding out what that crater is all about at some point right now is not the time because we're trying to secure safe passage our fast pad might be the hood at lanterns how do we get there yeah because it can we travel by is it safe to travel in the city like I know on the outskirts we kind of walk around but no but you have no other choice should we take the sewers there should be I think we should stay on I mean we could I usually use the buildings for I would say as long as I'm around the Market Square and not strictly through it I mean we can travel pretty quickly but the only thing I'm worried about as well with the wooden lanterns is yes we can go there but I have a feeling they're gonna be pretty suspicious as why we're coming in through the city and not from the outside I mean I see no reason not to be honest with him honest about what why we're here about how it's so awesome and we kick yeah we were helping clean up the streets of Drakon time yeah we did nothing wrong we showed up here and took out a bunch of harpies in a tower and we're using it as a little base of operations and if they have issues with that then we'll deal with that but I don't see why they would okay we don't have to tell them everything yeah yeah as long as we're in accordance with that because I think you're talking everything babe I'm pretty pissed I mean they don't need to know about other deals that we've made with anybody else or anything like the rap friends Oscar we don't need okay yeah they don't need to know you don't need to know about any of it so is that you're the target then I think yeah do you guys are you guys okay we're heading to Shepherds gate okay so again looking at your map it's pretty much a straight shot across Market Square and then through the middle Ward's so you could head directly there or through the city streets if you wanted to I leave it up to you to decide how you would like to navigate through the city with your vantage point you can see the lay of the streets and with Bao's expertise navigating there it's not going to be difficult it just really is avoiding any potential threats you might encounter along the way or confronting them head-on I plead only know you're looking at me like you really want to stay hidden you're so brave but I think we should play in to veio strengths she's better in the streets glunk glunk glunk glunk let's go I mean you clunked no matter where we go yeah isomers are also dangerous remember the cube do you remember the cube I don't remember anything about cube right kill the cube you mean the cubicle okay let's go is there any specifics that you want to lay out for your your trekking you'll be heading across Market Square and then you will pass there what you recall there's an intersection of several major streets where the grand guild hall is at the opposite side of Market Square from there you can either take the lower roads toward along the top of the middle ward or you can take the higher you can take Market Square Market Street until it intersects right up with Shepards way you can kind of see the way the roads go right from my knowledge do I know if one way is generally more dangerous than the other six or one one half dozen or the other yeah do I know if there's any specific monsters that lay in one area versus the other like middle ward versus Market Street that Market Street might be monstering the haze is heavier along the northern path because you pass closer to the mage guild tower which is where another significant part of the meteor crashed so there's heavier haze up there so you but from the South way the middle Ward the middle Ward is solidly controlled by Knowles as well like all that all that whole southern air like that southern side through the sprawl through temple Road that is very much an old territory so we either go with the enemy we know or go with the enemy unknown the devil you know is better than the devil you don't sure all right and we do know that we can at least semi avoid detection ish by putting urine on us so I mean we got that advantage we always have the urine play all right so I think I think we should head down more the southern way because there's less haze it's less close to some once there's I'm maybe going after that bigger chunk rock and then be as quiet as quiet as we can right Pluto I'm a trihard okay hey you can pass a third trace me now oh we can yeah oh I think it's if it's looking really gnarly that'll definitely help or I could just take off my armor wait I didn't say that it lasts for an hour yeah yeah how long would it take us to travel at my speed at your speed navigating through the city and with pass without a trace probably no more than an hour cuz we travel a little bit faster I did it yeah no I say we do that exactly let's get to the bottom first of this tower and then we'll go from there okay passing without trees okay you head down you lower your ropes what are you going to do about the ropes when you leave the clock tower are you going to leave anything in place to protect the site before you leave um I definitely don't want to leave anything hanging so they can anybody can climb up I mean if you can do all the heavy that you can do that work with your hook shot when we come back you could always hook shot up and then we could tie up a rope each time sounds good to me yeah like that okay and we don't leave anything and then can we is there anything we can use to bring towards the door to block it like any fallen stone like that I can cast mold earth to try to like jar the door closed once we leave I'm even wondering can you like fully close the door and have no door at the bottom I have noted like I I can move a little bit of dirt at a time but I can like I can make it so that it's not easy to open you can this would probably take you about an hour of work even if I just like put somehow with stairs I think we're pretty safe yeah if we have to if you have to climb up I'll throw a bit of rubble in there just to deter somebody being like is the store easy to open no okay okay superb so are you going to cast penetration castanet so you make your way across the desolate Market Square the overturned carts market stalls the old vegetables what little the remains and of course the corpses if bodies don't decay to the vegetables look okay or do they seem odd yeah most of them have been eaten by now there are little bits of carrots cabbages but very little remains now there's still little food laughing the city very little remains I pick up a carrot and I just start like munching on it okay you pass by the central buildings of the Market Square like slaughter Stone Square the Market Square is surrounded by the high Tudor style townhouses and great shops all along the edges with the big open-air market in the centre and there are centre this most central part of the market which is actually split in half by several large buildings in the middle and then another plaza there was a lot of trade activity in the heyday of Drakon Haim it was very much a trade city that was this lifeblood as you head across Market Square all of you can roll me a six-sided dice I got a 4-3-3 okay it's quiet morning in Market Square you navigate to the other side following along coming up to the grand Guildhall the grand the Market Square kind of comes to a point and then there's a short street that opens up again where there is a grand stone building in the same Baroque style of the Clocktower this one it has these high arches all around it it's almost like a oval-shaped building it has pillared arches along the grant along the first floor and the second floor is covered with this beautiful fresco that shows a member of each of the 244 different guilds of Drakon hime holding the instruments of their craft so it's kind of it's almost like a Colosseum like monument but two trades people this was the grand guild hall it has an old slate style roof that's like a big dome over the top of it and several of the windows on the second level are all broken through this front doors are smashed it's and even part of the roof is sagging and collapsing inwards it's one of the largest buildings in the city but not the tallest because this used to be the place where members of all the guilds all 244 of them would come and argue over trade policies in the city and of course it's at the intersection where the Market Street the temple Market Street and the Shepherd's way both meet so it's a real hub an intersection of the city in many ways you head so a long temple outside the south way though that you take the road that you follow leads from the the grant the grand guild hall to what is a street called players Street for this is where all the old theatres of Dragon high are I used to come here as a kid kitten you could afford going to the theatre for a short time I mean wait I would know that you were he lived in the castle in Dragon honey the theaters were funded by the Queen for for anyone who could not afford to see them you could only get in standing-room-only but all the common folk could see the air for free I go to the theater if your father took you you would have been able to see something yeah well if he didn't take me I snuck in with them once or twice you're a little bit short at that time so donut standing room was the best place to watch the theater for you carrot top as you head along the theater road you can all roll one more d6 1 3 3 1 here we go there it is you pass by a small square along the theater road where several old pageant wagons lay abandoned they used to be wet one of the old activities that used to happen in Drakon Hein was that all the members of the Guild's would perform excerpts from the Canon of true law which is the book of the Silla of the sacred fire which incidentally has over 300 chapters and so every year on High Holy Days each member of the guild would take a chapter of the Canon of true law a whole little wagon to the square and each guild member it would perform amateur style theater on top of their wagons and that was one of the ways that the guilds competed with each other by doing theater so there's several of these old wagons abandoned here and they are showing very old signs of repair because in the center of the square is a small crater glowing with a purple light got some delirium there I mean we are gonna have to meet up with River at some point to give her that information about Oscar we might as well great if I could get some more snacks is there such thing as too much delirium we'll just put it on your back don't worry yeah I can carry it okay here you can carry you right you're strong sure it's covered just make sure it's covered he's got it wrapping in him just put it in my a smuggling pillow okay before we get in here let's get multiple uses we already what we've walked into the smothering smoking square correct you have not walked into the square yet okay this is what you see gaudí scout yeah Scotty scout yeah you can generally see about 200 to 300 feet through the mist okay I just want to take a second and I'm like guys Shh and I kind of like put my ear towards the ground sure give me a perception check 13 you can hear footsteps and then as you pull you're up above here I chuckling laugh that of an OL crap do we hear it just fans have heard it so far ready to fight then you hear a few whips and barks as here many many footsteps coming into the square I say we move into and you hear a scream followed by some ripping and tearing sounds and the splattering of blood did we hear that are you ready to run are you going to are you hiding now or are you in the street I think we should hide I think we should hide as well so me and me and Sebastian eyes and we're like waiting back who just hanging out and bear you're on your own right now right so I come back to you guys I say we like slink into a ruined building and hide in the rubble and just wait to see what appears yeah occasionally I still got passed so let's be sneaky better so you see all right so we'll say this place you're the three of you in that ruined building right there yeah let's bring up the map they are a nice board camera now what I say is just stay within 30 feet of me okay no still be stealthy but just don't get seen cool do you want to be up there do you want to be probably down [Music] okay it's your natural vantage point though well that we're all just peering over like the Revel you're peering over as and you've been heading in this direction so towards me how can you run into this from the direction come several Knowles they are laughing and hissing and barking at each other and the first two Knowles you can kind of see past the pageant wagon you can see that The Scream appears to come from the the fact that the two nulls are holding two halves of a torso and throwing it between them and taking bites out of it as they walk forward and coming behind them come two more laughing with the lower parts and extremities of the poor unfortunate victim of the Knowles we tell if it's male or female we tell if it's human it was human but there's not a lot left to tell the Knowles are laughing and it looks like some of them might be carrying bottles of booze and they're laughing drinking and taking alternating by taking chomps of the various arms and legs that they have and as they do so I'm gonna have you all now roll your stealth checks you're a plus 10 because of your passive entry 23:29 17 okay you crouch down and gluto you step on it stick which is silenced magically by Bao's magic which is good because another group of Knowles walks down the street almost coming the way from the north there are four of them people need to clean up these ruined houses there's sticks the Knowles they look a little bit frustrated and bored but they're being led forward by a massive eight and a half foot tall Knoll carrying is carrying a shield and a large flail and the Knoll is barking at the other ones and as he sees the the others he barks at them as yeah and kind of howls howls at the moon and the this group and this group begin to converge together in the center what will you do I would like to wait and see what happens see if they pass I see a great opportunity one of the Noles in the other group is carrying a bag and the null the null start barking at each other they kind of start waving and they do a little bit of a dance with each other and hop a little bit because the other Knoll opens up a bag and dumps it out and it looks like the dismembered bits and pieces of several rattling and the Noles immediately start sitting down and eating well and do the lean up against the wall and like look at you guys like we gotta get the daddy we might be able to take this against my nature here trust you Sebastian to make the decision you do I mean I just want to fire spells I guess we could also wait here and let them pass let's wait a little bit longer and see happens okay wait big guy okay you're more powerful than I did last yesterday yesterday was it the night airs the night airs they fueled me I might have new smells I don't know the nulls continue to eat and drink and they're barking and laughing and making jokes in whatever there are no languages as they speak back and forth forth to each other how long are you going to wait when we look at the Noles did they seem intoxicated does it look like they've lost a bit of their combat edge so to speak give me an insight track drunk drunk drunk 2024 they're probably gonna be a little bit more ferocious while they're drunk but they might be a little bit less apt to notice things they're quite distracted as they as is even you can take them out in a pretty quick manner in all royal d65 or to one of the Noel's gets up and starts walking towards your ruins and as he starts walking towards them he starts taking off his loin cloth and you ever seen a dog walk like they've got to go to the bathroom Knowles walking like that yes yeah yeah I don't want to get peed on we already have be honest we did we didn't find any no we haven't done new pee and I just like the way all right okay we're gonna are they have they moved closer together than this no that's where they're all I am going to jump up now I need a good dog pun Pluto oh man I'm blanking I'm blanking you're okay your dog days numbered an autocratic you jump up and your hesitation at not coming up with a good dog fun I can have you all make one last stealth check 24 27 25 okay despite your hesitation to come up with a good pun I will award you surprised yeah and the nose will roll their initiative because they're quite drunk the Noles will roll their initiative with disadvantage oh well that doesn't seem to matter too much oh come on cool I don't have my spell templates oh yeah you need that the circles and the lines and the squares and the and they're done it's triangles no triangles yeah we yeah I do many triangles yeah your triangle okay what we got you know twelve eleven sixteen so they had disadvantage on their initiative Shack and only one of you that's right well maybe you didn't roll so good oh no okay that said they are surprised so with our lovely tracker with accent shields we will have avail then our Noll pack Lord our Knowles then pollute oh and Sebastian okay you all have surprised Bale you are first act okay so I am going to start by using my feline agility to I'm gonna pop out behind Sebastian okay so I'm going to pop out front of the building and quickly make a quick little resource the cart mm-hmm so I want to kind of be partially covered at least for now okay and then I'm going to use my dread ambusher to take my attacks looks like a three shots on my first turn this is what a glue stock what happens yes okay so I'm gonna take my first attack I'm gonna actually focus on the big baddie right in the center okay so take my first shot with sharpshooter and 14 okay your arrow rings out and hits him on the massive cauldron on his shoulder with a loud bang but it does not penetrate it all right take my shut second shot at him 16 this one though catches him right in the side it's a head yeah okay yeah 20 20 damage okay he how are you got my last shot okay 13 as he doubles back in pain and grabs at the the shot that hit him in the side the last arrow whistles right past him all right I'm gonna take my last movement with my doubled movements did you get behind this cart okay okay ludo you're up can I squeeze past Sebastian here yep okay right now right meow and uh I'm going to throw so I'm gonna jump out and I'm just gonna launch the the lightning jab alright um I want to hit this dude so everybody in that in the line I want these three to get hit by light alrighty so they all have to make dexterity saving throws correct yeah DC 13 the very first one manages uh just as you leap out he starts squatting down to do his business as you leap out and it's sales rate the bolt sails right past it but the other two are completely zapped by six twelve sixteen okay sixteen lightning lightning damage zapped in which to that leaves them both bloodied gonna mark that yep anything else and the 19 to hit the one the last one yes it hits and he eats it for 11:28 damage so the the chap like a bolt of lightning it crashes through the air hitting him right in the throat and impaling him back against the pageant wagon and in his throat the bolt of lightning sail out through his body and he continues to twitch and convulse as the javelin magically pulls itself out of the wall and flies back into your hand what I'm gonna throw it again at the big guy not as a lightning bolt but can I throw it again sure and the last one in the in the row is is killed yeah he's very dead a 22 hit that hits for nine damage to the big bad boy alrighty jashin you are up I'm gonna cast a hypnotic pattern okay where it's a 30-foot cube mm-hmm can I do I think you've got four tops yeah those four I'll take the most that I can okay those four yeah all right so I'll do the pack word first what's my saving 30 see it is 16 okay our backlog fails one of the Noel's the bloody dole actually succeeds and the other the other two both fail so these three are you okay acetate it so take out the rest okay they said they see the the flickering pattern of light appears and the through and the Noles despite even the pack or despite being wounded he turns looks up from it as he's like nursing his wounds he sees it and he just starts drooling yes it's a very beautiful it's a whole bunch of colorful butterflies fluttering around nice and mesmerizing okay we go to the top the round with Vail all right I am going to use my bonus action to cast strike okay and I'm going to start by moving about half way out here mm-hmm taking my longbow and shooting it at the injured one that didn't get affected by nice spell nice that is 12 it narrowly sails right past and I'm gonna take another shot at him as my second attack okay and that is for 16 and just as he's counting his luck the arrow collides the bolt collides with him and there's a sharp whack as a pulse of blood rips out the out from the wound roll the damage oh man that's max damage so he turns to watch the first bolt the first bolt just sail passive and then he turns around and it hits him right in the jugular there's just a spurt of blood that flies out as he collapses to the ground and then I'm like okay and then I take the rest of my movement okay so the PAC Lord is incapacitated and doesn't even get a saving cure to stop that Thank You hypnotic pattern thank you Thank You Sebastian Thank You Dark Souls okay so the knoll that was leaning down to poop he's not very shocked and takes his weapon uh pulled up his weapon lunges forward as his pants are falling off to stab at Sebastian he makes two attacks I have the high ground and he gets a natural one on the first attack I will give you cover from the other one but he does get a twenty two hit yes ok he get he deals a total of eight points of piercing damage as he lunges his short sword into you and I need to make a constitute a concentration check for hypnotic pattern 17 okay you're good nice nice could see other knowles okay the first two nulls here okay two nulls charge rate at you pollute oh hey swinging there flails over their heads and their short swords the first one comes right up to you Wow getting at seven and the natural one to hit okay as the the flail just batters on the front of your shield band eventually the second one comes around the hot beside like a canine hunter getting a 12 and a 9 to hit so they cannot penetrate your armor for the lives of them this last nail comes up onto I'm leaping over the overturned cart towards you veil Wow what happened to my dice guys lose it all on your initiative I've been undone yeah that's a compared to doll as the nose start savagely attacking me I'm gonna pull out my jab now I'm gonna use my sword and I'm gonna start start a whack and I'm gonna whack the one closer to Sebastian okay like 26 yep four is seven damage already and I'm gonna hit him again and I got a big old 17 so you attack the same one twice so are you going for the one with the flail or the one with the short sword this short story yeah okay so he tried to come around get around your shield basically you just take your sword around the side and you thrust twice stabbing him twice in the front both attacks hit and deal damage so this second root damage role 14 damage that you run him through any sling yeah and then I'm going to use my bonus action and and and push the other null okay away from me and I get a big old one so my strength check was a 5 the null the null pushes back at you in states where it stays where he is okay okay Sebastian okay um [Music] I'm going to use to sorcery points to cast darkness okay on myself okay a field of darkness eminates from you to look upon it is to look like a like a horrible void from which none light can pass what else would you like to do that is going to end your hypnotic pattern oh right because I can only concentrate on one are you sure you'd like to do that no I'm not sure okay I am silly and forgot just darkness yeah I yell darkness I cast okay you know what I'm just gonna cast scorching ray okay and I'm gonna fire up and all in front of me who you are elevated but he is engaged with you too normally had disadvantage on your attack roles but I'll say thanks to your elevated position you do not also he's tripping all over himself because he's drunk and peeing everywhere sixteen to hit yes collides let's roll all the attacks and then I'll narrate what happens okay 21 mm-hmm and 18 so you put your hands right in front of him at point-blank range now if I kill him with two can I can I move my third hit okay so yeah I he's tripping all over himself and I finger guns down at him a hand 8 for the first one okay [Music] seven survives both - so he's like reeling as you as you blast him with magic the first two times the third shot you're feeling lucky it's kind of like a haymaker boom for that slays him there it is woosh nice very nice and I love the finger guns now you're up I still was upper strike continuing want to move away so I don't give any opportunity attacks but I essentially want to go out and then in the building but there's like a rubble hole here so I can still shoot at this Knoll okay so you leap away from the knoll leap away and again I take my longbow right at his face and I'm trying to shoot him oh yeah yeah I think it happens that's great that's great sixteen okay solid so you backflip are you gonna shoot him a second time uh yes okay let's roll it second time oh okay that's a 19 so here's it's gonna kill him this is what happened so he left over the cart to get at you he slashed you you ducked down backflip up as you're in the middle of the air you turn around and hit him twice in that first in the head which actually doesn't the hole it's horrible headshot doesn't kill him even though like parts of his brain is coming out of the head of it the second shot you run him through the heart and he falls over wicked and those both Sebastian and Pluto saw all of that just happened and it was very close cool good good shot I was impressive so you have a small crater of hilarium and three drooling Noel's in front of there's still one doll there's still 100 left I still have one okay yet come here big guy is he gonna know he's gonna keep going for it he's just too dumb yeah yeah he viciously and savagely attacks Pluto to no avail and then I'm gonna repost it okay and 16 yet hit for nine damage nice that leaves him bloodied and then I'm gonna start hitting him yep I'm gonna give him a cold whack for 24 9 more damage right now face whack him again for a 19 for 13 more damage so as this Knoll presses his attack desperately trying to take somebody out you rebuff him slam him in the face with a palm of your sword and then come down cut one arm off come up cut the other arm off and he just kind of looks at you and bleeds I'm gonna kick him down take him on the ground and then I'm going to because the the big guys dazed I'm just gonna slowly like and cool like like walk towards him as if there's an explosion behind me okay then I think we all should we should just like circle around every minute I once just yeah okay Sebastian is that what you're gonna do you know you're all gonna move up yeah I say we we all move up and I stand face to face with in Vail you want to come up sure I'll go on the other side of the creeper though I'm not gonna be like right in splashing right you know okay so you're all gonna attack once at the same time yes so all of you can roll whatever attack you want do we get an advantage actually no I had not a creature affected by hypnotic patterning can still kind of defend themselves I got 20 I missed seven yeah okay so guys so Sebastian hits him oh you're gonna wake him up yeah he's pretty good work he's pretty Urton from it's a fireball era's enlightening and I literally I put my finger gun to his head yeah I pull I pulled the trigger doing seven damage okay so that breaks him out of the hypnotic pattern but don't kill him so so he flies into a rage okay on the count of three one two and then I fire and I draw my sword and takes double-ended play oh and attack Sebastian guys you were supposed to do it at the same time getting a 14 in a 10 I cast shield okay and I'm gonna hit him with Sentinel okay go for it so you finally get the sword out of your sheath and I put up a shield just to deflect it I'm still trying to get my claws untethered from like my bow being like either stuck 18 that hits okay 413 damage wailing in Sebastian so as its protecting his own with the shield you bring your blade down and it slices right down the middle of his spine Pluto a little late on that one this was literally just an assassination he was standing there drooling he'll do what's happening back there you've made you did a backflip and shot a guy twice and then you you're and then a stationary incapacitate a girly book yeah well you got real close you could've just stood away you are real close okay nice shooting my finger gun from that close tell you what I'm not I'm not doing point-blank anymore you know you go up to the next one I'll just start I be Gretchen are you 17 and hit for nine damage yeah and another 14 damage so this one you basically get the first shot hits him in the neck doesn't go all the way through so you pull and the Knoll collapses and dies and I stand over his corpse looking at his friend it's Sebastian what are you gonna do I'm not gonna go point-blank as a matter of fact I want theorem in the face you're not gonna just go no I want it over they stand behind Pluto unlike listen if this doesn't work you're taking you're taking the damage yeah I'm your free bud and I'm going to fire bolt okay it's yeah okay you hit the drooling doll with a bolt of flame let's let's do 12 damage that leaves him bloodied and veil I'm not using sharp shears 21 that is Oh baby okay so it's not so take the next shot 16 that hits that will kill him so basically what happens is Sebastian you walk behind Pluto fire bolt the knoll he went he snaps out of it looks in the direction of the of the of where the fire bolt came from goes to leap towards you veo shoots him once it doesn't kill him he's like rate at the the two of you and the second shot comes in hits him in the in the temple and I say down boy I told you told you we could handle that no problem I'm glad you guys were on the ball with that yeah I think we did fine right Bale okay the next time there's a rolling target in front of you you just yes you do you want to not stand in front of it did you get look at down I died cuz I didn't get it I didn't get it I didn't get it I didn't stand in front of the giant Knoll I didn't get it I don't know what the problem is yeah I stepped away it seems like a tactical error on your part when I counted to three I'm the only one who fired I I think you counted an elven that's what I didn't understand but I I understand yeah you guys didn't okay mistakes were made removing hostage nobody nobody's to blame here I

with old pageant wagons and a small deposit of delirium hiding out in the ruins is a group of Noel's took up their own break beside the Delirium to eat you popped out of the ruins Slough the Knowles candidly after a little bit of a mishap with a hypnotic pattern but they the Knowles have been slain to a man and you now stand in front of a small delirium deposit here in the earth yeah that yeah we get to Heavin and sort of my backpack and I is it small enough where I can pick it up there are five shards scattered about the crater amazing there's a just like the previous one you encounter there's a heavy piece of the meteoric iron the smaller shards that are in this one are easily kind of chipped away and broke it off there are smaller shards maybe about the largest one is maybe about the size of a deck of cards how big is the iron chunk the Irish are chunk is about 12 inches across that's small would I be able to put it in a bag and carry it weighs about 50 pounds but conceivably yes do you want me to kudo I like I like lift it up and I try not to struggle but I struggle and I'm like Pluto could you yeah guys thanks but it might would put it in the bag my bag you hoist out this piece of metal my dad's gonna want that you might give us some money for it we like money this is a much more manageable size than the rat prints one yeah that one's that one's big that one we have to find that our maybe just bring your dad there don't work like Kevin to bring a wheelbarrow just bring all this stuff and then he can work on adventure chip off all right I take the shards in this we gettin paid yeah did you waste these out the sputtering of the corpses of the various Knowles scattered about the square should we throw the Knowles in the in the new corpse hole I mean I don't want to touch them they smell bad someone will come by and have them as a snack don't worry but okay Moore Knowles do nosy nose definitely yeah yeah okay oh did any dog-eat-dog world out here I want to check their bodies okay the Knowles are wearing scraps of leather armor wielding crude weapons that they found they're rusted and broken and several flails which anoles love using because they can easily fashion them with some chains and heavy weights most of their equipment is in very poor repair and condition however several of the Noles had several sacks of meat with them and you use this like generically do you need heavy bags containing the dismembered body parts that are definitely human looking inside did they have anything on them like any pockets are you going to trudge through the meat sack I'm gonna take a look in the meat sack yeah let's dump out the meat sack there's mostly it looks like the components of an entire corpse this is all human meat this is where we have to drug along no no I'm drawing a line here I'm not eating human yeah but okay no eating humans I saw you with one hand has a a silver ring inlaid with amethyst I talked at that site and a coin purse with 35 gold pieces inside I'm gonna throw it to veio yeah and then I'm looking for the big guy does he have anything on him like this do they look and tell I made intelligent enough that they write down things or do they keep or they just they're just rocking out eating people knowles are from what you've seen of them and encountered of them they are borderline feral okay I'm gonna get my javelin well thanks for digging through the human meats yeah you got you know you got a ring out of it it's true you don't like it then put the ring back what ruined her it's already in my pocket leave it alone well umm can good good job what about the play the the play wagons I want and of the play wagons there's some scraps of old costumes that look like they're meant one of them looking inside it it looks like there's a fake pair of angel wings inside you should take those yeah I've always wanted to be in nature come on put them on it appeared it put them aha they're basically made of paper mache with chicken feathers glued to them I don't like put them on yes this is like community theater in Louisville if we run into more Knowles just convince them that you're an angel I get the guys help me put these on I come into the wagon but these odd we help him put on I feel beautiful thank you I'm the winged death and also the runners around appears to be as well a very crude looking devil mask report warns it's been painted red I put it on it I put it in there there is a pitchfork that has been painted black inside there you gotta find a costume yeah we're disguising ourselves as we go through the city there's also a a tail with a pin on it that's like a little devil's tail done I am dressed as the devil your dress is an angel veil what do you want to be find a costume are we sexy version or regular version I started like dig around this is the liturgical drama meant for family consumption I think you probably find a copy of this script as well besides with me wow this is really serious yeah you find a wig but it's one of those bald wigs so it's the one that has like it's it looks like a bit of leather skin with some fur that's been taped around it and a monk's robe yeah it seems to be super to see the play script seems to talk about a encounter that a early Saint head with an angel and a demon and the three characters are an angel demon and a monk you know what I'm gonna do just for fun I'm gonna cast this guy self and make myself look really fat like I'm a fat friar cat just guys anywhere in the bulk out and we're carefully walking down the street holding the script saying the lines not a bit of fun deeply religious play oh but really quickly gets into some moralization and personification of sin and sin and virtue I ad libs I have troubles playing my character the name of the angel characters literally Angel of virtue and the name of the devil character is literally devil of sin I'm devil of sin virtue briar fat cat briar fat cat I'm the devil of sanic how's it going devil that nailed it nailed this play yeah Elmo's ready we'll perform yeah well well well we'll win them over with our virtuous play of is it is it like would the but is it like sacred flame level like yes it's cuz they might love it they might be like the best way that I that I can explain this is the Canon of the true law is the holy text of the sacred flame okay and this is literally the play adaptation of a chapter of the Canon of the true uh-hmm so think of most holy books and how exciting they are now the hit play you have a work in a spicy yeah we're gonna kind of we're gonna add some dessert you know in all fairness the Canon of the true odd despite its droning moments has tons of blood and sex in it like all good holy books there's a ton of smiting of evildoers and a lot of violence in it even though there's a lot of moralizing it's a pretty pretty grim book I mean I'm happy with my role where the costumes were quoting from the play as you walk down mines like stop doing that don't stop doing that that's my line I will keep doing that serene stop doing that and then you're torn what do i do do I sin or do i yeah that is pretty much the the gist of the play well that was fun am I pretty noticeable with my wings are they big they're falling apart as you walk down the street there they're not terribly large they probably the wingspan of about five feet I was there they cherub wings are like full-out angel yeah I keep poking you in the butt with my pitchfork stomach as you continue walking you you pass by several the old play houses and come through the district through the various tenement buildings that the poorer people that lived in the city the the the theater district the the road immediately north of it was very well known for brothels many of the actresses and actors and performers that worked in the theaters needed to make ends meet by this means so you know you just have your evening of entertainment if you like the male lead in your play that that night you can rent them out as well that was the modus operandi here in Drakon Haim but before long you come out of this red light the theatre / red-light area of Drakon Haim into Shepherd the interior part of Sheppard's way where you can see the edge of the street the barracks of the city watch and Shepherds gate the barracks itself is a large set of courtyard walls that abut the interior side of the city walls so the way that it works is on the north end of Shepherds way there's the gatehouse itself and then the northern gate house tower has a wall coming out of it that then has its own set of interior battlements and forms another courtyard with another set of towers inside so the the barracks itself is built that even if the gate were penetrated the barracks would be a defensive formation it's a roughly semicircle shape bumping off the internal walls and there are two gate how gates leading into it a smaller fortified gate right beside the city gate itself and then a larger set of main gates as well giving the city watch two ways of getting in and out and also easily monitoring people as they came in this part of the city was set up to easily allow the hooded lanterns during the heyday of the city to mine the gate and the way that it's built is it's clearly possible to get from there into the defenses of the gate itself as you come forward you can see that the pennants and banners of the hooded lanterns still fly over the walls the hooded lanterns have a symbol themselves that is basically a hooded Lantern with the the beam lights coming over it that looks like it's being held by a dragon's claw and then alternating with the banners of the hooded lanterns themselves are the banners of the city of Drakon hime and the royal family the vondre the bon castles and their which is the symbol of a dragon perched atop a high castle tower on a green field the banners are looking quite tattered like they haven't been well-maintained but you can see that they the flags themselves will fly it high mast there are several soldiers patrolling the walls as you approach and just as you walk out onto the streets and make yourselves visible which I assume once you get unless you're are you well like how well-hidden are you as you approach we're showing off for costumes for sure yeah like I think I think we'd walk out like we're not afraid of the hooded men turns we want to see them so they won't we want us we want him to see us - are you wearing your mask she's wearing you step into the street there is a horn call that blares out and you can hear several the hooded lanterns calling at each other and say there's people inside the gates people inside the gates and there's a general commotion inside and a few after a few moments you hear a voice call down of a man comes up over the battlements with a crossbow train down on you and several others raising their crossbows from above and they call down what are you doing down there declare yourselves good morning thanks for pointing the crossbows at us we're friends of Petra excuse me Petra Petra do you know her PE TR I think so yeah what is your business here um I mean this seemed like the safest way to leave the city given all the other gates are kind of intimidating but I mean you seem a little intimidating right now pointing a crossbow at me and we're just just here to help I asked Petra we saved her recently were the ones who got her out of the rat's nest the man says wait by the port gate that way are you armed obviously are you smells yes why are you wearing those costumes because it's fun sir and dragon high needs more fun we're practicing a play yeah would you like to hear some of our lines I am no no no no wait by the gate I actually shrink back down to like my regular size like fun's over you know what you you'll get your chance that was a really good that's really good story there the fun police story [Music] the a short time passes and there is a general commotion within and the gate opens the portcullis raises and the man from the the towers above and Petra and another dozen hooded lanterns are on the other side of the gate as they open up and it's at this point that you see the striking resemblance between the man and Petra both of them have light kind of brown blonde hair and they're almost the same height the man as you look at the two of them Petra is either somewhat masculine or this guy is somewhat feminine in their overall face shape and that he's a very slight man and Petra herself is a very top woman so the two of them almost look like they could pass as twins and Petra says Ansem this is Sebastian Crowe Pluto Jackson and veo Sonia they're the ones that save me I pop the mask off finally I'm like oh you recognized me even with the mask on good for you Patrick you finally decided to come where how did you get inside the city she uh sure she says as she utters you into the the courtyard we took the sewers she's shocked she says that's insane you snuck into the city for the sewers it seemed better than trying to deal with the streets it wasn't very safe so we couldn't go back that way as she she turns to speak her her brother Anson speaks up and looks at veo and says I seen you around cat you used to hang out around here around that old clock tower as well didn't you yep where did you get that this is pointing to the in signa I've had this for as long as I can remember did you loot that in the ruins what I'm offended by that this was my father's this is mine my right there's a little bit of commotion and the other hooded lanterns like are all looking at each other with the this expression that says they don't know how they don't know how to react to that and Petra says they you gotta tell the truth where did where did you get that I'm telling the truth it was my father's and Petra sighs and she looks at Ansel and says we need to take them to the commander there's nothing what are we supposed to do and they step aside and you can somewhat overhear them arguing back and forth about this hey are you guys twins you say interrupting them Petra says yes and sums my brother okay cool cool you so twins guys is there some problem with her father's in signa they look at each other and and some replies commander can tell you what the problem is we're gonna go notify them you need to surrender your weapons to us you'll get them back when you leave fine only because I know that I've been with this troop before and I can trust them you're not very nice you around here already do with spells yes I am we need everything you need to cast your spell's as well we don't want any magic going off well while you're visiting the commander okay which of you cast spells I cast spells so do I do you do anything anything in the presence of the commander we will kill you okay uh well why don't you take my casting focus and I take the ring that I just looted off the body he turns to Petra and says he's giving me a ring do things okay and he says do they do they and like they kind of you know nevermind don't worry about it you don't have a wand your staff have anything like that I prefer what kind of major are you give him your give him your staff oh I'm sorry when was last time you cast a spell sir he he kind of shrugged since says seems like they really don't know much about magic oh so that I'm a much better mage than anybody else you know so you can calm down with the attitude by the way her name is veo so don't refer to her it's Kat anymore fine also Petra it's good to see you we're we're not really here to cause trouble we're just trying to get out of the city it's fine we're just gonna find out what you were doing in the city though first all right you got a lot to explain the commander of course all right he leaves but Petra stays she leads you into the central tower through the inside courtyard has been set up as a large training field with an archery range as well as Sarah a sparring field and there's a large stables where there's about a dozen horses corrigan the stable as well as well as a camel with several hunting hunting dogs - there is a small Forge that a dwarven blacksmith is working at and the whole area is really quite a buzz looking at the at the whole place as well you can see that fortunately the hooded lantern the haze is quite thin over here and with the the positioning of the way that they've built several dugouts around the area and it looks like they've managed to make themselves a shelter from the haze here because the the mist is certainly not you don't feel it the way that you do even around the outskirts it's much thinner around this area to the hooded lanterns lead you into the central tower where there's a set up a Great Hall with several large benches they lead you through the gates and again there's the the banners of the city here it's very utilitarian though this this hall and Petra sits down with you and another squire of the hooded lanterns comes and brings some water jug of what looks like it might be water down ale and some bread and cheese and they say and the the man that comes up says Petra said that we owed you a drink for saving her life so we brought some of the old meat up from the stores for you all thank you very much Squire what's your name he says my name is Peter it's good to meet you Peter thank you very much for the bread and drink thank you for saving captain Petra anytime and Petra says look I got a really apologize for my brother yes you do he has been going through a lot lately and he's a little bit of hot water with the commander so he's kind of acting like he's got something to prove interesting are you related to the commander or no that's that's a little personal but yeah we were adopted by the commander we lost our parents during the wars and once the commander returned to Drakon Heim we were kind of taken under his wing we're a big family here yeah I've I've lost my father too so I know how you feel by lost I don't mean dead I know he's still around and just trying to find him yeah sure no he's the the command that I know we we've all lost people and it's it's good that you hold on to some hope of course I know he's alive you think that that's your father's okay seen him wear it every day that I was around him when I was young I know it's his um but hey oh that doesn't make any sense I mean I don't want to I don't want to like offend you or anything but you're a Tabac see and yeah your father was at a back seat right I didn't say that oh okay that makes sense I I guess I get it you should get it considering what you just told me about how you were adopted yeah yeah I do I I get it yeah that's that makes a lot more sense now so I'm really sorry it didn't even occur to me yeah my just because my father was blood doesn't mean he's not my family like I said the lanterns if anyone should know that I know listen the commander's gonna be here soon so anything we should know before speaking to the commander is he is he a generally well tempered individual or should we be prepared for well what do you think the best approach is if we're gonna go converse with him he's uh he's been fighting over really long time and he's gonna figure ever if you're hiding anything he's gonna figure it out you never hide anything he's he's a pretty professional guy he might seem gruff in might really grill you but he means the best for the city and if what you want is to see the return of the old ways to bring Drakon Heim back to its former glory he's not gonna have anything against you of course if that's why we're here that's why I'm here awesome good I can work with that okay a short a short time passes and we show her our play yeah she she asked him okay ready everyone get to places I've got me I am the devil of sin I have an angel short while later from from the spiral stairs off the Great Hall comes a broad children man squinting behind grey eyes he's a very broad flat face and he has long braided hair and a long wild beard that kind of shoots it from the sides and down again before he's braided it in the in the middle as well just a massive mane of hair has kind of been all braided up behind him although his is kind of chops fire out to the sides and his nose is broad and flat and he kind of has that very big large head that's too high and broad but those small squinting eyes that kind of really he surveys you very deeply with them he he unfolds his arms over his armor and he cracks his knuckles and as he does so you can see that clasping his cloak is an insignia that is almost identical to the one that you are wearing veil it has the symbol of Drakon hime on it and then a smaller crest that shows the symbol of the hooded lanterns just as yours has the symbol of Drac and I'm on it but then another pair of towers on either side of the crest they look they're the same shape the same make they look very much the same and he comes up he sits down he says greetings I am Commander Elias Drexel who are you I am Pluto Jackson of caspia commander I'm Sebastian Crowe I'm from amberwood village and I'm veo Sonia and I am of Drakon Heim he pauses for a moment he pours himself some of the mead from the jug looks at the 3 end he looks at each of you for an uncomfortably long time is it my wings why are you wearing those costumes it was just a bit of fun that's a great question 2 3 4 I know he slams his fist on the table and says if you're going to make a joke out of this we're going to have a problem I apologize if I showed you any disrespect commander it's been a very long day we found these costumes and it was literally the only fun we've had in a while so we had to kill some Knowles yeah we fought our way over here and I don't think you can blame us for hoping for a little spot of fun distractions like that in this city are how people get killed well we're still here you're lucky thank you what were you doing inside the city walls is a quarantined area that is restricted to access to only members of the hooded Lanterns why were you in the city it's restricted access because I saw lots of other things yeah there were there are tons of things and Mike Knowles beside the point that's what we're trying to protect regular people from why are you bypassing the city's defenses and getting in there where it's dangerous see commander the key word there was regular people you've never met us before we have saved one of your own in the past I've heard that and you do have my gratitude for saving Hydra she means quite a lot to me not just as a soldier so thank you you're welcome gratitude only goes so far I guess but nevertheless that was in the outskirts of the city the inner part of the city is not safe I don't even send my troops out there except on the most important patrols and scouting missions why were you there Vale why were we there well first I want to point out that safety is relative to the people who you know are encountered but we were taking back my home my spot you were a resident you have a home in Drakon hun yeah regardless of your personal property at this time the city is under martial law and we have asked all citizens to evacuate it may be asked but doesn't mean we are evacuating we were actually there to help take care of the dangers of Drakon Himes and so you put it with all due respect commander we're not citizens were soldiers your Caspian I you are a soldier from a foreign land in the capital of West Amman why are you operating in this city outside of your nation's borders well not to get too political but everyone I know is dead and now these are my only friends I work as a I do not come here on behalf of caste I come here on my own accord he's a great monster slayer and they're efficient he killed a troll I've killed one troll he's some harpies yes harpy and a cube and I killed some knowles he's probably done more killing than you guys have in a couple years the three days doubt that but nonetheless that's impressive so are you here to work are you here to join us I'm willing to overlook your crimes if you are willing to work with us in a positive way all that we're looking to do is restore the old ways of the city we want to see Drakken Heim reach its former glory then if you're looking to do that I can provide you with commendations and I can induct you into the into the hooded lanterns and you can work under my command directly I have worked with the hood and lanterns before and it actually makes it easier for us to do our job properly if we don't we're kind of like a separate sect of Dragon hi I think of us like freelancers or like a cool secret naval attack team partners we're special because we have actually about if you are willing to if you are an unwilling to operate under jurisdiction of the hooded lanterns directly we have a few other issues to discuss I would like to know where you acquired that veil why told your underlings that I got it from My Father that's who gave it to me to hold on to the day I got separated from him and what was your father's name my father's name name I know his first is Johan you know that name you're on yes your father was the king's steward yeah you are my father was a king Stuart were you in the castle during the Queen named Kings reign I've served Drakken Heim for well over 20 years given my life to fighting it for this nation and I count myself fortunate to have survived what happened to our city this is the first time I have seen another insignia of one of the other members of the small Council well my father was a very important man and where's your father now that's actually a question that I had for you you don't know no is he dead no and why did he give you the commendation of the city during that time he thought it would be interesting for me to learn his craft but you had it that day yeah gave you that he gave me this that that day what do you know about my father your father was a good man he was a brilliant man but he had a tender heart the last I know of him if anything on that day he would have wanted to know what happened the king and the Queen and their family they were his duty as the steward of Castle Drakon but that day no one could get even into the into the castle and no one's been able to since that that you possess is one of the commendations of the small Council they were granted to each of the members under the authority of the king and they are very important to the legacy of the city do you know where any of the other members are no I can ask does that not make Vail by wearing that an important member of this city I don't know and I can't answer that for you the only thing that I can tell you is in my full honesty each of the members of the small Council swear an oath to never take into their possession the common tations of the other members of the small council or allow any under their command to possess them so I cannot seize that from you on pain of the oaths I swore to the king and if I believe in those oaths which I do I can't take it from you none of my man you can take it from me any of them try they will be executed by me and by me and by me I will prefer that you will leave that to me if necessary if necessary however it doesn't change the fact that you possess it and that normally it would require the commendation of the king or the other members of the small council for you to possess that I wish I knew where Johan was he would know better what to do in this situation that I would any of you I'm just a soldier really hmm my father always know what to do in these situations and I know he's alive I know that he wouldn't leave me here so I know he has to be in this city and I will find him there is ancient magic in the city my commendation gives me jurisdiction over some of the old magic that protects the city her father as steward his command was over the castle and its staff your insignia could allow us to get into the castle and what could that mean for Dragon Han we could find out what's happened we can if we control the castle again we control the city it's the heart of Dragon right what I'm hearing here is we're all after the same thing we are working together but there's no need to induct us into the hooded lanterns we have things that we want to do and we have our own way of going about things but we are on the same side and what do you want here commander right I suffer from horrible nightmares have all my life are the worst yeah I want I'm going somewhere with this I will I one time a long time ago about 15 years ago had a nightmare so horrible I woke up screaming on the streets of Drakon hime in the southward the dream was of a meteor striking dragon high I left for the amethyst Academy shortly after and barely missed the events that took place here fifteen years ago I've come back because I don't believe in mirko incidence so just like you you said you want to get into the castle so you can learn what happened here I have to know what happened here because somehow I feel tied to this place and the events that took place here there are many things happening in the city right now and it may be useful for the hooded lanterns to have allies that are not entangled that's us their strings baby there are no strings on me there are just mutual benefits to be had here we can operate outside of the jurisdictions you're an interesting Bunch I must say I didn't expect this from a bunch of people that my men were calling scavengers is it the costumes yeah they probably make us a little says to Peter Peter go to my office get the paperwork and a quill my seal here's what I'm offering you under my authority I may grant you a letter of marque you have the authority and the permission of myself commander I Elias Drexel to conduct business within the walls of Dragon on I've only issued a handful of these don't lose it along with this letter to that grant us permission to use this gate yes thank you may use my soldiers here will know that you can use the Shepards gate as you need to to get into and out of the city are you residing in the clock tower very top yes may my soldiers use it as a look at point as long as they don't touch my stuff especially my food we got to bring their own rations and also don't touch the the little robotic guys that are up there either yep I'm studying them like maybe third floor third floor he looks at very possible with that and says fine there then we shall settle to business I have a variety of things that I can ask of you and I will tell you this while you are working under the commendation of the hooded lanterns you may keep 80% of anything you find in the ruins you know 20% is to be really wished to us in the ruins of the castle in the ruins of the city Oh anything you find in the city is the rightful property of a good people of Dragon hymen and we need it we need to call upon those resources so that they may be returned one day to their rightful owners the problem with this no one I think to show our good faith and I take us the tiniest piece of delirium out of our bucket please don't give us that okay I'll keep it anything we find yes 20% of the valuable Goods 20-person you can give that piece of delirium to the quartermaster and we will accept that as payment oh sweet how are you points I'm not wearing gloves right now Oh two backsies you know put it back no sting if you'd like to pay us in delirium that's fine we have some connections we can sell it I don't know that's fine ah yes when your commander when are we released from this contract good question when the city is restored or you die or or we sighs stop adventuring enjoyment may we buy out of our contract you choose to leave the city that's your business but while you operate in the city you will turn 20% of anything you find over to the huddle entrance in exchange for free operations within the city all right but tools and weapons might be used to our advantage may we continue to use an own and operate what may take your pick of those but if you do happen to find weapons those will be considered amongst your offerings of course we let me put it this way if you find anything special in there you find weapons from the old noble houses if you find magic I don't care what it is we need those things too okay all goats toward the sames fight it does all right I think it's a fair deal you know sign my name on your scroll now with this I think I have some work for you if you're interested I will tell you I have a standing bounty that's my job that's what I do are for any rat folk and Knowles or minotaurs you might slay and I will pay you for each one of the heads that you bring back to us I do not believe at this time that you or us possess the resources to confront the castle yet if you do Scout the castle I would be interested for any report that you might have if you visit the crater I would be interested for in any report that you might have but I have another pressing concern the silver order of Illyria is camped outside the city yeah we saw that a number roughly 200 and we believe that they are making a march on the city towards sample gate well that would be good right it would clear out the Noles there it would I'm I understand that you got into the city through the sewers where how we had help where did you come in along the river the river no that's where we tried first litter cube that's where we came in the dream right oh yes no we did go through there I would like you fine fine Diggs or Klaus please tell my Scouts the way that you use to get into the city so that we're aware of it I would like it if you could pay the silver order or visit find out what their intentions are find out what they want to do here they won't talk to us why not because they don't trust us they're foreigners I'm a foreigner well fortunately for you maybe yeah you don't look like a conquering army I can used to come maybe maybe I can that maybe I can be the the Greece between the wheels I can help with your negotiate that would be interesting if first I know what they're interested in doing here yep if they're planning on some kind of salt on temple gate we would like to know about it so we can make sure that that plays out in our favor and not necessarily theirs okay now in order to do that ideally it would be very good if they are planning an attack it would be best for us if that attack fails what causes enough damage that we can seize control of the gate ourselves now in order to do this I've got to asks number one can we keep it secret our names that we are helping the hood and lanterns because that's gonna be more in your favor and allow us to infiltrate in other places I recommend that you do keep its clandestine that you are working for us it's not our mouths that I'm worried about it's more or less your soldiers and I'm also a little concerned that we have this mark there might be a way we can keep this off the but this letter of marque I'm going to draft it same one that I gave to another group of Caspian that came in here last week it will look to my soldiers just like I have authorized you as adventurers to operate inside the city there's a few other groups that I've given these letters out to they won't have any they'll just know not to attack you or cost you or seize any of your goods did you give one of these to a Lord Jupiter Jones yes I did don't trust him is he doing good did he look like he was eaten by a dragon recently no he actually came in with a huge haul was very impressive actually how much you and he was willing to I charged him the full price if he I said I was going to take everything from from him but he offered us over a thousand gold pieces for the letter of marque so I gave it to him wait I thought I sent him to his never mind never mind that's great good to hear that there's other adventures in the city wonderful there's many more operating in the city illegally of course and we know that they're getting in through various means but I it has been useful to me to offer these to a few groups and you're one of them and to the rest of the hooded lanterns that's all this relationship is I got one more thing that I want to ask for if you hear and if you can inquire maybe under the table about my father they oh if I knew anything about your father I would tell you but you have resources when I returned to the city trying to find another member of the small Council was one of my first goals the only other member of the small Council that I know of that still might be alive is the warden but he's head himself shut up in Saint Salinas for almost 15 years hey that's a better lead than I've gotten in about 15 years so that Lucretia Mathias converted him and he's been living as a hermit I imagine he still has his commendation he was a good friend too but I haven't seen him in years well thank you for that that oh well see if he knows anything get me actually that's very true if you do want another job if you want to find out what they're up to - for me that would be greatly appreciated cool we have a lot of a lot of jobs that kind of are the same as what you're looking to do so a lot of overlap then this sounds like a very good partnership I think perhaps I can promise you that between you and me you will have my honor and my word thank you that's me as well and I put my hand over the crest that I have who he salutes as well and offers his hand to each of you I give him my Caspian fist bump cool you're welcome to stay here if you need to okay yeah first about hanging out with Petra yeah I'd like to chat with Petra I apologize for Ansem he's a little bit hot-headed I think he's been visiting a girl in amberwood village that is very happy with him in the gossip gossip I'm still surprised you haven't recognized me from when our castle days I knew that I knew that Yohan had adopted a cat I just never put two and two together well now you know does anyone want to see our play yes we could do a play for the hooded lanterns we've been practicing for the last hour I take the ball to cap out again Oh attitude I'm the devil of sin angels might be good for morale yeah I'll let the chaplain know and with that several of the hooded lanterns gather in the courtyard for your performance of the monk caught Twix in and right and virtue some us caught Twix vice and virtue do you all want to give a performance check yep how did we do guys 4:18 the rest of my wings fall apart the there is an uproar of laughter at your performance but a positive one there they the hooded lanterns find it very funny and they invite you to spend the rest of the evening eating and drinking with them in the barracks before you set out to your next objective yeah get all tense fantastic I think we're up there for the night yes that sounds like a good place yeah yeah with us giving a play so that wraps it up with this evening a big thank you to our cast Kelly Jill and Joe and Kyle and
