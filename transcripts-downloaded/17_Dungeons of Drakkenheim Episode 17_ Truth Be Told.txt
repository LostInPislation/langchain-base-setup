of the silver order in the outskirts of Drakon I'm known as the scroll thus known as the sprawl which have become a battleground between the silver order and the Noles as the silver order lights fire to the district itself burning down buildings in an effort to stymie the advance of the ravenous Knowles and their control of this area of the city our heroes had received word from none other than the rat prince who desperately swam down the drain river to warn them for the paladins are slaying all of the monsters of dragon hime and they do not discriminate between the pretty psychopathic rat folk and the equally psychopathic Knolls of the city and have been slaying the rat princes brethren in equal DRO and driving them out of this area of the city what our heroes will do about this situation remains to be seen but they are now on the backs of the horses of several members of the silver order heading towards the Paladins encampment for what reason and what will happen there we do not know the horses gallop forward as you walk past the devastation the silver order has created flame breaks of controlled burns where they are burning down sections and blocks of the sprawl using these strange tanks that are worn on the backs of some other members connected with tubes and cables to these long Lance's that they carry in two hands that have nozzles on them they release the valve and a torch at the end is a light setting forth a goat of flame that they use to ignite buildings and Palisades that they have set up to control the fires there's a stockist smell that hangs in the air alongside the fire it's an acrid gaseous odor that almost is nauseating to smell you were riding alongside one of the paladins who has introduced himself as Virgil Underwood you've only seen the smallest segment of his face underneath his armor and helmets as he lifted up his visor revealing a grizzled face with a handlebar mustache he's been chatty saying what the paladin's have been doing how they've been organizing their flame breaks and going forward and just saying that they would we're gonna ride you out to safety now our catchments the safest place for miles around I show you that far safer than most city streets we found you in I doubt that still got a say you really did a number on all them Knowles back there I don't think I've ever seen three people slaughter that many of those creatures you're good enough scruff aren't you I like to think so yeah we we hold our own we haven't needed any help in tracking him yeah it's so interesting that you guys are showing up now and burning the place to the ground when three people could handle it pretty easily well there's countless number of those ferocious beasts in the ruins and we tried to make our as much headway as we could use in our groups that our full company strength but we found that each time was struck in and no matter how many of them we cut down the next day there were more of them and of course with all that that smoke and haze in the city we can't make camp anywhere we gotta head back out where it's safe and you can breathe and no one gets sick so we found that the only way that we could make any headway was just by cutting a fire a swath right through the city itself that's what we're gonna do all the way till we get to the grand Cathedral and who's gonna pay for these houses to be rebuilt because you're obviously destroying people's houses well the way I see it there ain't anyone living in those buildings now anyways and after being abandoned and blown down for 15 years there ain't much to them anyways they're gonna have to get torn down if anyone actually wants to live here again torn down versus burned down it's all the same it's just a bunch of ruins now walls look still look good bunch of the churches and the old buildings were keeping them safe too there's anything that we can salvage we we see to it that we can but till then the ruins are as much a maze for us as anything else well yes for you who haven't really been here very long no he's making sense I don't like that he's making sense but they just kind of come in here and scorched-earth classic yeah I understand what you're doing but why but you guys aren't from here this isn't your home everywhere is home to those who follow the lot we are all neighbors and we are all brothers and we must take it upon ourselves to see that this world is protected from all forms of evil lest this place become a Hellmouth for any sort of vile creatures that could rise up and strike against us there are already several groups working here that are protecting it and are trying to rid it of monsters us included so technically you're stepping on our toes by coming in here burning the place down and claiming that you're here to save us all when we're already we've been working for quite a while I mean you can take that up with the not captain but the way I see it you've all had 15 years to do something here and you haven't done much of anything at all we just arrived when did we arrive how long has how many weeks a couple weeks ago so I mean in two weeks we've cleared out probably a hundred Knolls we've made an alliance with the rat folk that you've been slaughtering they're working for a wait hold on you've been having Congress with these mutants some of them can be very helpful those things are corrupt monsters and beasts and they will only lead you astray they are true monsters and they are beyond redemption you know how we got in and out of Drakon hime without any problems well with minimal problems don't mention that gelatinous cube nope they helped us they're the best guides we have to the city they know it through and through [Laughter] she's right there beside you best guides in the city way I see it you're just lucky that they haven't led you to your death yet well that's why we have her all I've seen from those scrawny little rattling x' is traps traps and more traps well have you taken time to talk to them look as a as someone who's familiar being a foreign invading force it's good to make friends with the locals they haven't taken any time to talk to us they just come up and try to throw bombs out as poisonous stab us or stick us in the side so we've been flushing them out wherever we find them I mean they're vicious little beasts I tell you that still I don't know what's worse them the Knowles or the other bigger creatures that we've heard about inside the city in any case we'll cut through them all the same we won't have to make any deals with them once they're all gone well I mean we take care of the bigger creatures too I mean Pluto over there he killed a troll I killed a troll he killed two troll least one troll on his own that's impressive its bare hands no help very impressive rotten true I have no doubt about all y'all's abilities to fight and survive and I can see that you've had to do whatever you've needed to do and make whatever deals you needed to make to get in and outside the city but that time is done now we're here in force and numbers we can break down these walls take these gates actually secure the area don't have to go sneaking around like rats in a gutter and when you secure it what's your plan after that are you gonna leave dragon I'm back to its people you know what I don't rightly know they're not really my business to decide what's gonna happen after the missions over by and large that's the role of the knight commander so you'll have to take it up with him if you really want to know what the plan is we're just here to be righteous Souls and the fight against evil and wherever we need to go we spread the lot hmm well I think you need to take us to your commander then and obviously give us a little bit of food so we can't be weary on our way right we'll bring you into the camp you seem like brave folks but I don't like hearing that you've been making deals with those rat folk and we don't like hearing that you've been burning our city so I mean I guess we're on agreeance on that subtle with our approach you'd better know a lot of people think that they can fool the silver order that we're simple folk a lot of people thought that end up dead just to give you warned right now I've never met no funny business especially no lies in front of a flame keeper because she'll see right through you well I've yet to meet someone who can kill me so I swear on the silver flame I was so believable you really sold me did you convert about you you ain't from Westham are your Caspian nature uh yes sir this is mr. Virgil sir I I came here for my own it's like a vacation I'm on vacation kind of fun a place to take a vacation don't you think I like to kill things like trolls did I tell you I killed the troll i i i was i'm here from just on like a couple month journey i'm just trying to find myself really get my my sword tuned you know there's no rebel in the butcher's work less stained the soul we do what we need to do for a righteous cause not the name of just death and destruction for its own sake so i hope you're not here just have a joyride and slid a through few throats oh well then you're gonna hate my book my pamphlet killing killing and thrilling the Pluto's tail I tell you we're determined folk but we don't take pride in the work that we do it's necessary work it's the work that must be done for the lat and we don't take upon it latley takes true noble heart to end a laugh to know under what circumstances its rat and just for one do so well I stare into the heart and eyes of the things I murder I don't sit on a horseback and torch everything you're like dropping bombs on on Dragan Heim there's no there's no precision there's no there's no heart to it look you have your religious beliefs and and in caspia we mean on the line on them but I respect the work that you do is just that you're you're kinda you're you're dropping a bomb on anthills here you I think you need to peel back a little bit and remember that this is still a city and in someone's home it's veo a song okay you you can argue much as you want me about that but that's not my decision to make I understand I'm a soldier and I'm here to do what must be done and far as I can make make note of it we're doing what must be done this place is between you and me I'm surprised that we're not just burning the whole place to the ground seems like it's almost entirely beyond saving but not captain says that there's work to be done here and so we're gonna do that work we're gonna do it right and I trust them to know what the right path is for us I think being on this path that you're on that you would believe in some sort of redemption that this place can be redeemed if possible not just burning it to the ground well the way I see it is if you're gonna dress a wound the first step is to cut away the infected flesh medically speaking yes accurate sounds like we're gonna want to talk to your commander how far are we from the camp not a couple hours so you got a good ride ahead of us you got any food sure we got some bread and cheese and meats and dried nuts we're welcome to share yes thank you that's uh that's really nice we haven't had a nice meal since yesterday you look up at the Sun there's no Sun since whenever we were in amberwood village last time we ate you Raisa moon with Virgil and his fellow Knights it's difficult to tell if they're all men or men or women underneath all their armor they're all clad identically in the same same style of chain or plate armor as befits their rank they seem to have some sort of insignia that indicates his rank is a sergeant of some kind or a leader of a squadron they're all on horseback as they march forth towards the camp you can see that they as you approach in the distance after an hour so travel across the Karen Hills you can see the camp that you saw from the clock tower before and that your words had previously oversaw their Vale trying to kill my pigeons it's a large company sized military camp that has been built with in a rough rectangular shape with a high wooden palisade all around it where they've dug a ditch around the whole thing filled it with spikes or water in some parts of it seems like the way that they built the camp is that there are gates to the east and the West but respite hours which are also on each of the four corners that they have a makeshift drawbridge that will raise and lower on either side one of the things that strikes you immediately though as you come towards the camp is the flight of three Knights astride Griffin's circling overhead and the call of the horns that sounds from the riders as they see your approach three Griffin's a hmm do we steal Griffin's four paladin's along as well I would know several hundred feet from the main gamut they have built another set of Palisades around what looks like to the ruins of an old barn and granary the Palisades here are built with a little bit of extra stone and there are several large wagons outside it alongside various barrels and and the palisade here has an extra ditch dug all the way around it which has been filled with water completely so they've taken this farmhouse built a palace a palisade around it and it seems to be quite a bit more fortified and protected than the main encampment which is much larger the as you come up to the main camp you can see that there is another smaller camp outside the main gates there are several tents arrayed around and one large command tent and beside it are the banners of the hooded lanterns like a diplomat tent or like there would be no more than a dozen people in this smaller camp outside but the large tent is that which you would expect to be her meeting tent or command tent interesting I say we go see who's here I say first we would we talk to the commander of the Paladins yeah I don't know we're do you want to you want to check out the hooded lanterns I also just want to ask Virgil very quickly hey Virg wow you've really made headway yeah we're old buddies that other place the more fortified one I'm guessing you got to protect all that oil and stuff that you're carrying around that that stuff's got to be dangerous you're a smart man that's where we keep the dragon's breath why would you call it see I had to learn magic to figure out how to do stuff like that you guys are just doing it I assume non magically you've be honest with you there Sebastian I couldn't tell you heads tails how those things work but they seem to do the job for Virgil it's really interesting if I understand that it must be under strict protection but maybe with an escort I would love to see what's going on in there I don't think so I'm fascinated by fire and how fire works and I tend to just create it any one of the other knights that is carrying the Lance says it's fairly simple you just pull this and the thing in front of you melts Oh was there an instruction booklet like is that the quick start well we got to keep them safe mm-hmm the tanks are armored on the back so that they they don't get shot they've been treated on the outside so that if someone tries to throw a torch at you you just don't explode right there on the spot but you got to be careful around the fire around it that's why we got the extra armor on the back for them to protect them and yeah it's it's a bit of an honour Karen one because it's uh can't come something with a little bit of risk but it's well worth it and generally most of the nasties just turned to hell round soon as I see you lower one of these things in front of them it's a real joy to see if you hit it hard enough with fires is that is that dangerous for you guys like is have you ran into any smell casters or anything like that that have caused you problems now I can't tell you exactly how these things work but we've worked out a lot of ways for us to you know fight around that so when we see you know we all work together make sure that those that are carrying the dragon's fire are well protected and we tend to not use them in the front lines of battle they tend to be more of our second line I see I hope you're getting paid the good hazard pay like the quality tuna for your having to carry one of those she the other night she speaks haven't she's Duty is its own reward and she they just pull the nozzle out of nagato flame she's at the top it's also a lot of fun I apologize for all the questions I'm just very fascinated by the mechanics of how this is working I've never seen anything like it you guys must have some really intelligent people working on these probably never considered that question before I imagine so uh I mean you know we get get some help and some thoughts there's there's all all the good works of this world offer up a lot of solutions for those that are willing to have a little bit of ingenuity for the situation if you can't show me where the where you keep all of the tanks maybe I could talk to at least talk to one of the people who who creates these devices I'd love to to meet them I think for that you'd have to head back to the Shilin city or far away we don't have anyone here that knows how to make this we only have what we brought with us fair enough my fascination will I'll pocket that one for now and we'll come back to it so we could we could either go see the commander or we could get a little bit of information from the hooded lanterns about their relationship how are they here or who from the hooded matrons are here yeah if it's like who we don't want to be here is it who is it I just wanna make any is it weird if like you go meet the hooded lanterns and we go meet the commander should we all stick together and stick together but I can pop my head in real quick well yeah let's say hi to the hooded Lantern 10 we're because it's on the way the first exhibit in this new exhibit was I'm on vacation I want to just see all the sights alright so uh I jump Virgil yeah you take a quick detour what are the hood lanterns doing here Oh they've they've been causing a whole fuss from what I hear they're here to meet with the knot commander that makes sense you know these guys yeah we've heard of them yeah yeah they work for a dragon ham they are dragging him they are tracking him I mean if you want to stop and talk with him if you know if they're friends of yours you're welcome to do so and you want to come in and you want to talk and you want to see things that's just fine you can wait out here with them and we'll come and get you in when they're not commanders ready to talk to you okay yeah thanks thanks Virg Virg that right yeah his name's for a church like Virg Virgil Underwood thank you sir Underwood Sita Mukherjee o V wood [Laughter] hey there V would you yeah yep the encampment with the hooded lanterns you can see that there's the larger command tent and a few smaller ones all around a central fire and a set of equipment they've got about a dozen horses that they've drawn up here as well that they'd hitched to some posts around the and as you approach coming rushing out of one of the tents is Petra Petra the woman that you are from the known her for a long time she's got the light kind of sandy the very thin build with the sandy hair sandy hair tied back in in a sharp bun she's got her the green robes of the hooded lanterns and her arrows and bows and her equipment with her and she she rushes out and she say she says you all always manage to show up wherever there's trouble don't you oops that's our way of helping we had a ride on a horse it's very true we're here to figure out what the Paladins are doing I assume you're here for the same reason exactly have you seen what's going on oh yes we could see it from his madness they're insane agreed we have questions we're talking about the same thing right fire the fire yeah the fire that yep yep yep what do they think they're do what do they think they're doing burning the city to the ground are they crazy they think it's past Redemption it's like a holy thing they're gonna undo everything we've been fighting for the past 15 years I still want to know who's gonna pay for it personally witness question is any what's your plan why are you here I'm here with the Lord Commander Elias drechsel's he ransoms here we brought a bunch of our our soldiers we mean to tell them to leave I think or at least what they're planning on doing there's you know really know what to do this is a whole company of soldiers there's at least 200 of them we don't have the resources to take them head on take them on head on like that sure we can fight them in the city on the rooftops on the walls but they're just burning everything down have you engaged with them have you fought them we had a few encounters it seems like a things got smoothed out so far but it's been really tense ever since a few of us got killed a few of them got killed it's been tense to say the least speaking of tense I'm looking out at their camp here and all I see are a bunch of tents and wood and they're all carrying flammable okay they're all carrying flammable barrels on their back if you wanted to take them all out seems like all you need is a little fire in the right place you'd think that but they're the ones bringing it here you really know how to manage it well they don't keep any of it inside the main camp it's all out there yeah but doesn't mean it's the only way to set fire no not at all and certainly we've thought about it but a lot of them are good people they're just here to do the right thing they're not that's true they're just nice people we just don't know what to make of it yeah I mean I don't want to jump to let's burn their camp down I'm just saying that if we mean it but I was laying I was looking at ways to I was looking at options I'm looking at all these nights the the silver order has made fire their middle name they really know how to manage it in their own camp I think that might work well I think that they're wise enough to know that that's something that they're vulnerable to well fires my middle name as well sebastien fire crow with my one fire spell that I know Julia want [ __ ] literally I know two fire spells and that's certainly an option on the table I don't know if the commander's considering that or not yet what do I'd like to hear what they have to say but have you considered and not that I am saying that this is the only way but have you considered working with them okay bad idea I'm sorry she gives you the thousand-yard stare I mean I just want to hear what they have to say there illyrians yeah no yeah I know I get it how can we trust them we can't other than burning down dragon hime what is it that they want they said they were burning their way to the the cathedral because maybe they might get something and leave or maybe we just sabotage all their fire because if we can offer them hey we're going to the Cathedral to look for such-and-such and we say stop burning the city we'll go get it for you if we fail continue but we never fail from what I've gathered they're on a mission of a different order and even though they may get what they want they may not necessarily stop until they believe they've fulfilled what that order is and I'm just interested to hear what their commander-in-chief specifically because obviously the guards don't know what's going on yeah at that the main command tent opens and Ansem and Elias Drexel step out of the tent and Drexel the Lord Commander of the hooded lanterns this is kind of like brooding face and dark scarred face he says I'm wondering the same thing myself I don't want know what to make of these paladin's and until I find out what their objectives actually are I don't want them setting any more foot in the city than they already have agreed agreed sir is the other guy that's with him is that Petra's brother yes oh good that guy did he did he read our note did you get our note Lord Commander wink I say and wink I've been waiting for a few more updates from you all seems like you've been having a bit of a vacation back in ember wood village we needed to take a few days off three days off Oh everybody's given us we were roughed up a little I was hoping that you were gonna come and check in with these paladin's first before I would have to come here but I was sick of waiting and they forced my hand I had to come myself yeah we were a little busy my family home burned down it was a pretty tragic so I apologize we've also been monitoring from afar in a way to make sure that no we did find out what it was happening we came here straight away yeah we got a ride on a horse have you have you ridden have you never ridden a horse I miss my horse like you have no idea how nice it is to not have to walk everywhere this armor is more like a horse armor I bet you like gain some muscle though I have what's your horse's name very sore Mathias and where's your horse now well I don't know maybe the dead horse said that we know him I know a horses are all well and good for getting in and out of the city but actually riding one around in the ruins it's a complete liability true yeah it's like a Ferrari cannot ride in almost no time in a dangerous town city traffic these days absolutely in the corpse watcher the corpse thing yeah if you'd like you can come with me when I go meet with there a night commander don't get confused I'm the Lord Commander he's the night commander I'm worried about that too but we'll figure it out who's higher on that yes different cities so different technically speaking from what I know about the illyrian military order they brought a company of men here so whoever their leader is is a captain or a major at best you're way higher than him but by the authority of the city yes I am am I higher than him with my badge I point to my badge they oh I know you're carrying that thing around but you are not the Stuart think that in these dire times my father gone that I have some semblance of addition to any plans that go on in drachma him that's all all well and good but the stewardship of this is not a hereditary office that's an office that can only be granted by the by the king all right but the badge the badge feel like a kid with like a pony's magic I'm glad that you've kept it safe oh I'd keep this safe over anything even my 2/9 to be perfectly honest I'm relieved that someone has it and not them because that's the biggest thing that I'm more concerned about interlopers here in the city with all the documentation all the relics all of the badges of order and office that we still haven't found they could find anything I'm concerned and from what I've heard from just talking to their rank and file they're here for the grand Cathedral the Cathedral of st. retrouve oh we all believe in the light I'm no man of great faith myself but the Cathedral of Saint but Rubio has many many holy relics of our faith there and for the silver order the hierarch these are important things if they mean to retrieve them that's fine I don't care about those things but the grand Cathedral is where the city kept the lineages the archives and the last will and testament of King Ulrich oh that's a different story what are they after they might not want that but if they found it if they took it they could install a Caspian well pour some illyrian puppet on the throne and I can't have that I'm a whelp if I were to find the Kings will the seal they could rewrite it to be whatever they wanted and with the military force of the illyrians behind whatever they say the word of the king is they would get all the other Nobles to fall in line pretty easy this isn't good now this isn't commander I have a question do you have a list of missing artifacts that would be key to the ruling of the city like you said the seal but what else I know obviously these badges mean something if the king has a will it would say what the right of succession is it would say in it which of the noble houses is related to the royal family and which is rightfully to inherit the throne it could end all the civil strife we've seen across the nation just by having that official documentation especially in the hands of myself backed up by the seal of the steward anything else that could verify its truth hmm then we'd have something well why haven't you gone in to get it survey Oh can explain but the Noles have made the grand cathedral there yep we've done we've dealt with nulls we've dealt with large groups of northeast in Col that sounds just like a food hall like a mess massive Knoll ten feet tall I'll call the Lord of the feast uh-oh pure white except for the blood all over his fur yeah have you seen him I've seen him and he would send chills into the very crevices of every part of your body hey don't I got chills in my crevices my elbow just my inner bump but just being around him takes all the Noles up into a frenzy of fury it's like the fires Hell themselves has just been ignited in their hearts they fight like nothing else we've never survived an engagement against we have to run whenever he's near he would need an army to get past that no or the greatest role killer in the world and the greatest spellcaster in the world I use that term very loosely but I'm talking about us with respect I'd be sending you a death sentence if I tried to send you there I couldn't do that good conscious Pluto Jackson killed a troll that was how tall it was like pretty tall I don't know that a mean ol I'm not great at estimating feet but if I had a way to measure it it's the biggest troll I've killed I can say that confidently how big was the other troll it was probably smaller I mean you've only seen the Lord of the feast at a distance but I've seen him slaughter good men strong men I've seen him kill men that I have seen kill a troll he's personally so tell the kids about not to go into the city even me I think that they're not quite understanding how fierce he can be I've seen it with my own eyes look I've been a dog owner my whole life so I think I know a little something NOLs technically art related to canines they're actually related No then I might be aware of my depth here never owned a hyena you're saying you don't think we can handle it so you're saying there's a chance so you're saying there's a chance because I like that I am saying that Dave's right you would need an army to take on the cathedral st. Petrillo that's an army but if they go in there what if they just burn the whole place down I don't think they'd burn we have nothing Cathedral that's even worse yeah okay so that but they might just sees everything and claim Drakon Heim that's why there'd be lining it for it I think if anything we have to get there first you know what as much as I've seen this Knoll and from from what I've heard about the stories of him I I believe in our group I think if anyone can sneak in there without an army we could do it are there sewers underneath the Cathedral what I remember the sewers catacombs all sorts of things there was a huge burial complex for all the great saints and paladin's and Knights and clerics that have lived in the city they were all buried there there's a huge complex underneath the Cathedral perhaps we can get into the Cathedral without going on the streets catacombs through the catacombs you start with cat but cats don't like to go there it's dark that's confusing it's dark and not many people like to go there that means that we have a better chance of running into less problems that's true unless the dead decide to come back well that's which seems to happen at least none of us are carrying any of that goop from the mirror oh wait look I'm gonna surprise you you'll be happy to know that the cork is still in place and everything's fine probably and I can I mean I have my favorite enemy is Undead my favorite I mean Lee's favorite so I like to kill them that's good that's a negative tricky Lord Lord Commander yeah we're just gonna have a quick aside for a second I don't have a team huddle just give us one moment my leash huddle back up there are Griffin's we could fly in we could also this is my thought while we were thinking while we were talking while I was thinking and you guys were talking I'm gonna just say it what if we waited until they marched on it and like right when they're outside the Cathedral then we sneak in and then get everything we need and then peace and then they while they're fighting knowles that still means that they have to burn their way into track and huh yeah they still burn their way in the dragon home for sure maybe do we know what happens with flames and and delirium well yeah we do don't we do it doesn't it like set it off the whole time I don't know didn't we learn that one time from Oscar I'm not sure I mean I've cast a few fire spells in and around dragon hime nothing that bad has happened I also think that remember what the Academy said about getting a foothold we want to actually prevent them from even getting to the game so I'm wearing the gate of nulls and having it owned by the paladin's is actually a better situation I don't know it means we have an in and out on another and out true I'd rather them not get a foothold and potentially steal the will of the king and destroyed forever the idea behind dragon I'm getting its own power back I came to the city to do detective work and solve a mystery and I ended up mixed up with a political battle hmm well not my for today Pluto mm-hmm you still feel super Caspian I'm feeling pretty Caspian I got a I got to ask you a question and I don't want you to take offense to this question but I'm just gonna ask it yeah it's the big you know you know I care about you right yeah meat you're not after that will and testament are you that will and testament no but what I am after in the Cathedral full disclosure Caspian relics Caspian relics is fine I just I trust you I just heard the words you know a Caspian could rewrite that will and I just wanted to to make sure that you weren't asked by your family or your home to grab that will for them well I have no intention of rewriting that well yeah awesome your honorary dragon high now yeah you're wearing I believe where my mother's cape so my father's armor it's on the outside it's what's on the inside so you're like pie the crust of you is tracking I'm showing is Caspian Oh what film by what filling am I I want to be meringue no that doesn't have a crust no like cherry a bitter rhubarb oh yeah a little just a little tartness sweet and tart sweet and tart that's you I'm a rhubarb pie all right can I have ice cream yes do we know what ice cream it's the dragon - ice cream shop yes you old dragons ice cream shop okay team huddle over so we actually know break what's our plan I think you know what if we can get the hooded lanterns to block their escapades into the city and we can get there first can I at least figure out if the relics are there because you know I think what's the most important is making sure that that will and testament is found agreed I might know somebody who can get us through these sewers into the catacombs who do you think he's my best friend other than you - which I'm realizing now is kind of sad aside from you - my best friend is a insane rat man like Pluto is also my best friend know though I think we're like best friends thank you oh those necklaces that Triforce a friendship yes Triforce approach anyway we should talk back to the matter now I think we should still talk see if we can like hey we'll go before you and figure out we'll clear out some Knolls make it easier will be the scouting party yeah I can do that I'm good at that I'm good at walking in a front door and blasting everything because where there's less of us and we're familiar with the city I am very familiar with the city you know the city then you go up here such a good plan and break Lord Commander we're gonna go talk to the knight commander that's not you that's not you you're the Lord Commander the day commander we're gonna see if there's a way that they can hire us as a scouting party to go ahead of them and then is Petra's brother still listening yeah tell me leave and then I'm gonna tell you the rest in private yeah we need to talk to you fine and I glare in Petra leave a moral problem come into my tent well hooray alright I go in what do you say did you get our note did you get our nose did you read our did you see the no we made you it did thoughts queries I don't like the idea of someone trying to smear my son hmm so you didn't raised Petra and Ansem they were war orphans through the war and I love them with all my heart and they are loyal soldiers and if you want to go dredging up rumors about my soldiers questioning my judgment we're gonna have a problem see the problem that I have is that we had interrogated some of the Queen's men and one of them gave up information that they had eyes and ears inside the hooded lanterns that's not the sort of information that you should take lightly Lord Commander and I think that you should question every member of your team including your children just to be absolutely sure because if there is a mole within your ranks that's not the sort of thing that is going to be okay for reclaiming Dragonite with respect you can't trust family who can you trust no one look Lord Commander has a good line we're not saying it might not even be intentional he may be being it could be blackmail because he's spilling the that he's the wrong person it's it's reckless and foolish but he's he's also in love what's right well foolish doesn't fall in line with you know someone who wouldn't be fooled by the Queen's men he from what information we have gathered might be having a relationship with a member of the Queen's Minh and how do you know that these Queen's men are just setting out lies to sow distrust that's exactly how you break the bonds of loyalty I don't know that but how do you know that it's not true because I trust my son more than I trust some and who's spewing words to buy their life who are the only ones to know we were going to the tower in the first place like do you think that think about that commander because you and your lanterns were the only one and I have put my faith in the lanterns and they've tried to lead me astray before so I'm I'm putting my foot down on this of your ranks I am well aware that there is an issue with secrecy within my ranks and I'm working hard to minimize its impact but your outsiders to this group you are not hooded lanterns you turn down your chance to join the ranks I can't control you and if I could I would be telling you to fall in line well you don't have that sort of control Lord Commander and all I'm gonna tell you is that I've had some experiences with family that I put my trust in and it has been a disappointment not all family but all I'm saying I'm not telling you that you need to betray your son I'm just telling you to be aware of any signs or red flags that come up don't be blind to it just because you love your son just look and listen and observe and if something seems out of place how dare you give me advice on Parenthood on command I don't think you know maybe more than you it seems if you're that blinded by your you know what I'm so sorry Lord Commander you keep your loyalty with your son but now that means that there might be more people in the hooded lanterns that I'm uneasy about trusting because if what I heard was true which I don't know if it is then how do I know that information I tell you won't fall to the Queen's men if there are eyes and ears in your group that's something that should make all of us very nervous I don't blame you it's hard to figure out who you can trust in this city you have to trust actions or the words exactly we've done nothing to go against you exactly neither has my son someone in your group has and trust comes from the top down they call it trickle-down trust like like I'm gonna stop I won't expand on that talking we nailed it you're good I love that boy he's a good soldier Petro too we're soldiers and if they do have a knife poised to strike I'll be the first one to slit their throats I mean jail first Judah listen to me all that thank you Lord Commander for your ears and your mouth speaking of trust though we have to decide what we're going to do about the silver order yep I don't want them marching into the city burning buildings down taking relics doing whatever they please they've already asked if they could march through the Shepherd's gate they've already asked that if we could use our fortifications my answer is no back to discussion on this topic um do you have enough men to hold temple gate and Shepherds gate if we were to take temple gate both gates can be held with a skeleton crew we could do it it would be a stretch it would be hard but it would be worth it interesting we might want to keep that one in our back pocket if we're gonna go talk to the knight commander in a moment here we are and if we don't like what he says maybe temple gates should go to somebody else I have my doubts on whether or not we're gonna be able to Stimme their advance in all likelihood they're POI judging on their movements they're poised to make an attack on temple gate in the next few days we have a choice we could help them or we could not help there could be a middle ground here we could help them until an incident occurs we're really good at causing incidents I have a knack for things catching on fire that shouldn't catch on fire and there's a lot of flammable objects amongst the Paladins so I don't want to kill any good people but if it comes down to protecting the city there might be some hard choices that need to be made and I don't want to kill good people either from what I could tell about all these people they're good they're noble they have their hearts in the right place but they are illyrians they're not from the city and as far as I'm concerned they might as well be a group of foreign invaders that are trying to take over my city and I can't let that stand if I have to spend their lives to retake this city so be it I would rather spend those lives in a valuable way I think we can't agree to that if we can avoid bloodshed between us let's do it but I think dragon time should stay in the hands of dragon hime I agree their mere presence has kicked up a hornet's nest with these nulls and honestly I believe there are a lot of those creatures in the city far more then we might be able to take on on our own but we can use these invaders to our advantage and maybe use them to draw out the lord of the feast just thinking of that pluto you want a new trophy yes is it is it get you a white belt don't ya I could wear like a white like like a like a coat like a cape you already have a cape I'll get a better a bigger cape nevertheless well okay you can see what they're going to say yeah and what their intentions are we have one more group huddle let's not keep the commander waiting too long but short group huddle short group huddle I'm gonna go tend to my men will see you in their camp shortly thank you Lord Commander what are your thoughts Pluto I think we need to compartmentalize even more where you going explain it's mom he could you know he loves his kids so he's not gonna betray them I get it but also I think if we tell the Paladins if we try to work with the Paladins and we end up going in and doing stuff at the cathedral then they'll know that we might have the relics if they eventually get there and they're missing I think we should just listen to them and then run in and grab stuff and leave and just not tell anyone so then no one knows we have it that way we can hide it at the tower based on everything that we've heard though the thing that makes me nervous is that that place might be swarming with more nulls than we've ever fought before now I know that we can do a ton of damage to nulls we've we've wiped out whole hordes of them but this is different yeah I'm a little concerned on our skill level here but I don't want to rely on either of these groups do you think that the paladin's would be able to draw the Noles to the gate I think if we time it right we could you know go in during the chaos and we could create a little of our own is wink Bom Bom is temple gate operational like does it have a functional portcullis and like depends on who you ask hmm fail the Noles do I know if the portcullis is working because if we if we like that was my thought is like going during the fight we go through the sewers or something or the catacombs and then yeah but if we come up into the the church and it's still swarming with Knolls we're still gonna have to deal with them if there's a fight happening though that's going to draw most of the Noles out we can also just blow I welcome if there's an army approaching you send your troops out to face the army you don't keep them I mean you might keep a few back but a few we can deal with they're not going to keep a large force back it's it's the big prize that I'm worried about that what he does to the Noles sends them into a craze and they get much more vicious than what we're used to dealing with that's fine maybe they'll wipe out the paladins or maybe the problem will take care of itself we get the paladin's to draw the nulls out to temple gate a war ensues we sneak in through the sewers we get the stuff without telling the paladins we tell the paladins that we're gonna go help them out we sneak off go into the sewers they're fighting we get the stuff we come back out we see how the battles going and I don't know how this ends this is the problem what's the ending of my plan do I still think it's a good idea what you said about not telling them because if like the more people that know are doing the more I feel like people are gonna turn around and backstab us we don't tell them what we're doing but we still might need them to draw the majority of the nulls out great but we don't tell them that we're going after the stuff we don't tell them that we're going into the Cathedral we don't tell them we're taking the sewers we're telling interns what do we tell them oh wait doesn't the lady have the live vision yep what if what if she asks us are you gonna get no why would you ask that I'm panicking don't worry I'll do the lying I'm really good at it nobody can see through my lies I think ultimately if we can figure out you believe me Wow I do believe you was that a lie good I think ultimately if we can draw the fire to the gate then that'll give us a better chance but I don't think it's gonna eliminate the necessity of killing some milk we could also just maybe earn their trust a little bit by dealing with temple gate maybe that is easier for them I don't see we could like oh I fell and then I don't know what after that I just I think we should go to the night commander yeah let's talk to them see what their perspective is as you wrap up your discussion Virgil and a few of the other Knights step out from the gates and Virgil says the knot commanders ready to see you now are you coming in with this lot as well we come in on our own accord but we will be entering at the same time yes so what are these Lord Commander with respect Virgil turns to Elias Drexel are these more yours or are they lack hmm no no so so why you got that badge we're from Drakon hime we do not represent the hooded lanterns or any other group we are the three crows oh sorry Jackson three three crows Jackson three so your mercs oh no we're we're a group are you mercs what some know we're are scenarios yeah we're no no we we're a group we're a team we're part of Dragon hime we represent we're just know the fixing and finding of the royal family you ate with the know we know them we're not with them hooded lanterns three crows paladin to the silver flame Jon so you're you're who the three close well we don't actually have it's Jackson it was like a band but instead of music we helped saved recommend but we also do plays sometimes it's true we actually have a traveling look we're getting distracted by the the yes I agree let's go or separate they're not hoodlums that's all you need to know sir Underwood thank you just show your badge this is a relic versus out there days well with respect Lord Commander you gotta have better on recruiting cuz I saw these three just cut down like more than a dozen Knowles earlier in the city like they're good give him that I I looked I looked at the Lord Commander I'm like by the way we were told money for no kills we don't have the heads but you just heard it we have just heard it we have a witness we'll talk about this later tuna all right thanks V would grepping us Virgil leads you into the camp as the the seesaw sort of style gate opens up from the top so they draw draw the ropes up the gate opens up into a large military in camp that has been immaculately organized it is split into four even quadrants where you can see that there are several tents of soldiers all arranged in neat rows and as you look out on the individual rows you can see that each group of tents has their own distinct like they all have the same colors which are the gold silver and red and white of the silver order but all of them have a different field pattern that distinguishes this the different units and all of them as well seem to be organized into units but platoons and then overall into this entire company of 200 soldiers give or take there's probably at least another hundred or so support staff of Squires and quarters that are managing all of the horses by the gate there's a lot they set up a large stable where they pitched what must be probably at least 40 horses they have several wagons of supplies a large hospital that you pass by where they are tending their wounded and you can see that there are priests of the sacred fire that are miraculously healing their wounded and tending to them both in magical and mundane ways they have set up an outdoor area where they can offer their prayers where they have a large brazier set to the silver flame and the entirety of the Capitol is built around a second there's a second set of Palisades inside around the command tent so there's that also itself has two gates leading into it so there's the outer structure where everyone is commanded where all of the troops are and then there's the internal command host itself aha there is a high tower off the command post that rises up over the the middle of the entire camp and you can see they're roosting are another half-dozen Griffins mmm so they've built a high tower with the ruse and the Griffons that they're using is as mad as we write in I'm kind of looking at the ground am i able to find two like hand-sized flat rocks everything's been pounded into mud but there are a few bits of stone and gravel around that you can pick up but perfectly flat rocks you probably have to pick around for a couple minutes what about what about even as we were like coming from the other camp to this can you look so I'm looking for a way to communicate with my friends during the meeting without anybody knowing and mold earth can write words on stone so I was hoping to give them each a stone so that I can cause words kind of like I can only really ask you guys yes-or-no questions when we're in there and then you can nod or shake your head but that way if things are going south we can kind of decide if we're on the same page or not that's that's my thought magic stone walkie talkie stones oh yeah he stones okay okay they bring you forward into the command post where another large set of command tents and a few other smaller tents for the sergeants and lieutenants have all been set up and the central command tent this large square tent in the in the very middle appears to be set up as a meeting place the as you come in to the center the central section they have a rack of empty racks of weapons and they respectfully say now we all trust ourselves to be reasonable folk but we'd either prefer that you tie your weapons down a piece bomb them or you leave them here what's the first one if you wish to keep your weapons with you we just ask that one of us is that able to tie them in place so you cannot draw I will I agree make sense to me I'll agree do you tie your weapons too we will as well cool I present my bow around myself cool tie away they secure your weapons you want a tiger one it's like tape to my chance I don't even know where I keep my wand I still haven't gotten a holster for that it's just in my pocket I guess we can tape my pocket close tape you really mean liberals the Lord Commander Petra Ansem and three other hooded lanterns are going to be coming into the meeting mm-hmm the three of you have been invited and you step into the command tent where Virgil is posted as the guard and seated at a long table that has space for all of you to sit are two people one man is seated at the long edge of the along the long edge of the table and he is at all but rather lieth man wearing fine chainmail and bits of plate and a late breastplate he has long shoulder-length brown hair and a face full of stubble and a deep gash on crossing his right eye where he's placed an eyepatch and he's kind of tied a red bandanna through his hair beside him is another figure she is a heavyset woman with smooth okras skin and very large plump hands that are kind of held in front of her almost in prayer she has a very large round face with elegant lines and dark freckles you can't see her hair she's got a rather large headdress on and she's garbed in the robes of a priest or what we would what you would know as a flame keeper which are behind high up members of the clergy and the sacred fire and as the you're shown to your seats and she takes the seat at the head of the table night commander lady flame keeper my name's Sebastian crow it's an honor to meet you oh now sugar I'm not the night commander I am flame keeper or philia Reed I'm just here to be the God for all this conversation between y'all this man here is the night captain Theodore Marshall I look to him I just switched my gaze and I'm like night commander my name is Sebastian Crowe it's an honor to meet you and you as well what what did you say your name was serene via a philia read it's a pleasure to meet you Sebastian were the three crows this is a Oh señor Jackson Jackson Jackson 3 run that by me again Sebastian crow BAE Oh Sonya Pluto Jackson our three crows guys we need to talk after that's basically all of the people in the room look at each other with a huge look of Confucius and just shrug won't figure this out one day Jo Sebastian Pluto at your service Yeah right maybe my commander Kurt rad says they and with that Ansem speaks up and he says now I will introduce the Lord Commander of the hooded lanterns of Drakon hime Elias Drechsel captain's Petra and myself Anton Lange at your service losers more I whispered I salute theater of martial gestures for Elias Drexel to sit opposite him and everybody takes a moment and a philia speaks up and says we are all bounded together by the lot it protects us and calls us to do what's right in this world sure I asked you all to submit yourselves now to the way of truth and for win as I bless our meeting with a ritual go on so she is going to be casting she to say this in game terms I'm gonna be cast in this ritual now that will just ensure the truth of all our words I don't know I asked you all to submit to this spell and those of you that do not have no place in this meeting I can't counterspell without anybody noticing I should have taken subtle spell oh well okay that's not gonna happen you just you wave your hand in the air [Music] and I counter spell without them noticing would they think they still cast the spell she would so she has explained basically and to step away from the metagame and just yeah express that this is expressed in the in the fiction the caster of zone of truth knows who fails they're saving throws against it and knows whether or not it's in effect so because of this she is saying openly that she is going to cast the spell and she is asking everyone to voluntarily fail her saving throws against it and then she is going to end with the caveat that anyone that does not will be asked to leave does it affect the caster it does guys this is where I'm not good I've lied my way and into and out of every situation that we've had in this game so far so your main talker is about to get truth bound at least we'll get some answers I'm afraid of what I'm gonna say if I'm truthful I have to talk I like to talk I'm gonna open a Drexel says yeah yeah you can just you understand of course then well we share your respect or truth and honest dealings there are certain things that we cannot say to you for the honor of our city cause to us there first yeah that sounds fair yeah yeah can I also if you if I want to just not say anything I want to be truthful but I also think that there are limits to what you should be able to ask of us if you ask us in an appropriate question can we respond with pass sweetheart you are free to keep your mouth shut as you want it to be if you open your mouth and you bring words into this room they better shine with truth well I would say to you that if your words don't bring truth that they do not illuminate the path for yourself and others around you I would question what you are doing with your lives I mean not saying I'm not gonna be truthful I'm just saying what happens do I like glow well you stay here in this room you will not be able to laugh oh okay so yeah all right I still think that we should be limiting and be able to not say things if they impede with the mission of you don't have you don't have to yeah if you stay in the room yep and you submit to the spell yeah you can't lie oh but you don't have to talk okay cool yeah but you can't lie I won't lie okay what's the worst that could happen guys oh stop it all right yeah let's do it I'll be honest I submit okay we cast the spell zone of truth and it takes us places on all those do you fail you're saving through yes yes what does it feel like do I feel different it feels like a silver coating has taken over your voice cuz I'm so shiny if you test if you just test it I pick up I pick up a rock and I go this is perfect but instead of saying purple you know wasn't turned on either that was an obscure reference to liar liar [Music] okay Theodore Reed speaks up thank you Oh philia I always appreciate your guidance in these situations well carry on so I was expecting a little bit of a warmer welcome from their locals here in Drakon hi I thought we were gonna have a bit more of a friendly experience but it seems like we've been the ones bringing the warm welcome so far warm isn't hot yes but not necessarily warm are you purposely making a pun about fire cuz I do that a lot really I think it's very good I enjoy a good pun it's never really delivers very well but I'm a fan of FEM and I make myself happy cracking joke I enjoy what you did there I like you 1% better than I did five seconds ago and that's truth well I'm glad to hear that so if I got this straight you 3u plus a cat 3 u 3 what's a cat CRO you're a bunch of mercenaries just out here fighting for for whatever do you want just a bunch of money what are you all here for we're here to find out what happened to dragon hime and hopefully along the way be able to find some of the people who were in charge of dragon hime and rebuild some sort of I don't know group that can manage and run the city again we're trying to raise it from the ashes and we've actually done a lot of good work so fine we found a lot of good clues and we're very happy with the work that we've been doing which is why we were surprised when there were suddenly fires spreading through dragon hime I'm tired of being called mercenaries yeah we was the truth we're a group just like you just like the hooded lanterns we're just smaller more powerful they're not partners what about you miss your friend racket huh I lived here my whole life wow I'm impressed that's true it's working right Ophelia so you mean to say you've lived here 15 years all through all this mess more than 15 years I've been here for the 15 years but I've lived here my whole life I'm impressed with you and why you stay because I like Sebastian said I'm trying to find people who are important to me and who are those people my family and how do you know they're not dead I believe in my soul that they are still alive that's true it's waiting that's its true thing we all gotta fight for what's true for what we believe in and if you have family you love them missing they're my only thing other than my new family hi you it's a Pluto Jackson Pluto Jackson Caspian Prince indeed what's a Caspian Prince doing here in Drakon ham well all my friends are dead cuz I got them killed in a cellar so these do you want your friends then oh they are my friends okay I guess all my friends except two are dead three these are new friends we all got any friends back home I do I have a family back home ah so you mean all your friends here did yeah all the friends that I brought here are dead I'm trying to be so truthful ma'am sir I might say Theodore Theodore sorry sir tonight commander I I'm just a little sweatin sorry Pluto you got that no that didn't answer my question friend Prince Jackson Prince Jackson oh that's so nice yeah that's me what brought you here to drive I need to restore the honor of my family and what do you mean by restore how do you think you're gonna restore the honor your family by coming into the city by killing monsters and recovering lust Jackson artifacts what kind of lost Jackson artifacts there's one in particular that I really want well my dad wants it's a sword I'd know what it looks like because he's told me what it looks like and it belongs to him did you say this Elias Drexel speaks up says I don't understand with respect night commander I don't understand why you are grilling these people on their personal goals to which the addresses I'm just trying to get to know that's all I just want to helps me figure out in the spirit of honesty what we're all here for Nate commander why burn your way through Drakon Heim what's your purpose why do you want to get to that Cathedral so bad we are all you nodded out of the lot and darkness has shown upon that Cathedral for far too long and this cannot stand it is a holy place which has the bones of Heroes there those bones those relics of our faith made a bask in the light again this place the city has become a blot on the land it is a scar it is a wound that will not be healed and we are here to do what's right in our hearts and sue this world and bring back the order that was once here Knight Commander if I may you have arrived on the doorsteps of track and I'm in the midst of many other groups that have represented dragonhide for a long time finally getting the leeway they needed to start closing that wound it's taken 15 years but the healing process has begun so why do you believe that you have more of a claim over this city than the ones who have been working for 15 years now with respect lord commander Sebastian we aren't here to claim any sort of authority over this city it is not our intent in very least to do that good so when you find these artifacts or if you get these artifacts does that mean you are going to leave with all your soldiers because that is what you stated is your intent we're here and we're gonna stay here until this city is back on its feet again but it's not your city to protect it's ours and like you said you are here to get relics to shine them into the light again all people in all places are one in the sacred fire our bonds of fraternity sorority go deeper than the borders of our nations if any of the royal family were to remain which is one of the things that I think we're all searching for would you agree that they should be be able to take back the throne of tracking hime and rebuild this city and have a say in that he sighs and says now but way on I understand it no one here seen a member of the royal family in 15 years Danny you seen a member of the RAL family hmm I will answer your question with another question as a theory to speak so she says child you hesitated for a moment there you say that just a moment ago that if we believe it in our soul that's enough to go on with her and her family I believe it in my soul I believe that it's true that a member of the royal family is still alive and that is something that I strongly believe and I'm willing to fight for it okay okay you don't believe that you know it's true in my soul I know it's I can't I can't word this you're not gonna let me pick the words carefully no you know it's true in your soul that it's okay you're gonna choose your words really carefully mm-hmm give me a deception check we're code of truth deception it's possible creative word choice metaphor works 18 my soul o filia stands up she looks at you in the eyes have you seen something there we've seen something that city did I fail I'm like she's asking you I have seen so no no no no heavy use and as she goes to say it Elias trucks will stop and he looks up at you yes or no have you seen a member of the royal family of Drakon hime yes would you like an explanation yes we went to Queens Park Garden there we found handmaidens of the queen who led us back to the Queen herself who was a mutated monster I pulled out a mirror and exploded her eyes and then we left there's a moment of silence in the room we're gonna take a break right there today you didn't have to say anything but you I I figured if I gave them a story that didn't end with like that ended with it sounding like the Queen was dead that would be that would be a truthful answer that maybe I mean we did leave after we did leave nothing I said was a lie I can tell no lies great avoid choices I'm so scared of everything right before we dive into the ruins again I want to

tent at the center of the silver orders encampment here at a long table underneath the canvas tent lit by a few silver razors and a warm hearth with a few goblets of wine laid out a few bits of food and hardtack no not hard tack few bits of food some hunting that they have done they've brought out some food few fruits dried nuts bits of dried meats as well some bread they are breaking bread with you a little bit brought out a little bit of salt there's notes all scattered about Oh philia Reed's seated at the head of the table with to her right the night captain Theodore Marshall and to her left the Lord Commander Elias Drechsel with the rest of the hooded lanterns seated on the left hand side and you all on the right-hand side Elias Drechsel stands at the table his hands forming into fists on the table as he listens to your response I grabbed the wine and I start drinking [Laughter] did you leave her there it was out of my control did you leave her there you're an idiot did you leave her there you Caspian her hey there's no what is that true did what do you say about me is true believes it to be true and that's the picture we took her body from the tomb is she dead she wasn't dead when she left is she alive now we don't know he turns to the the flame keeper Madame whatever magic you've worked here is a remarkable I like you she blushes when did this happen a veil you grew up with her you knew Leonor is she alive or dead she's not when we saw her who she wants what once was she's where is she and why didn't you bring her to us the Queen that you know is dead what we thought was a monster we took her body out we don't know her current state that's a straight answer we can't tell a lie or is she I start eating food what I do know is this is true you found the Queen so where is she now we all want to know I think I agree with you on this commander it seems like your mercenaries haven't been full right with you we are not sure scenaries we are working to restore dragon drive like a bunch of mercenaries and so are you asking me all these personal questions not considering us a group we've told you three times now not to call us mercenaries and you're not listening you also haven't told us that you're gonna be leaving dragon hime after - you're beating around the bush on our questions the same way we're beating around on yours and that's how this seems to be working yeah so where's the Queen well that's for us to know because we don't know who to trust right now we don't trust you and right now I don't trust certain members of the hooded lanterns hey what's his name him the brother yes brother are you working with the Queen's men how dare you bring that up we're in the zone of truth it's a great time to get answers have you been messing around we're gonna find out one way or another with a simple yes or no answer isn't that just gonna put this all to rest answer the question he turns to Anson boy you don't have any dealings with that queen of thieves do you and add some says no I don't do you have any dealings with her men or women no I don't do you know of anyone in your ranks that would know I don't Petra Petra what about you she says no of course not Lord Commander Lord Commander no I don't sweet I told you that I knew who I could trust in my unit well now we know we can't trust you and now we know to thank you we're learning a lot about each other I don't trust any money if you don't accept you guys funny how you think that it's possible for someone to not be in to be an unwitting informant it's still possible that that boy there that girl there they could all be feeding information to them blast these without even knowing it well we still don't know why truly when you're gonna leave the city when are you willing to take your men out of the city the moment drackett hub can stand on its own two feet once again when it does not need us anymore we will leave would you leave it to the people of Drakon Heim or would you have a foothold here the night captain says to be honest I can't promise you that cuz that's not my decision to make and whose decision is it that would be the hark we're just soldiers here just like you Lord Commander we all have folk we got to answer to we all have instructions on what we got to do and I know you're curious about when we're gonna leave what we're doing here but we've been sent by the higher here to do what's right this is our holy mission the light has shown us this way and this path and this quest and we're just here to do what's right and if the hierarch tells you to stay and take over Dragan Haim because you believe it's the right thing to do would you do it because I can I don't know what the hierarchs gonna say but I know what and how many people you have here and what you're willing to do in order to do what you think is right o philia speaks up and she says the hierarch speaks for the flame itself she speaks only the wisdom and truth and if we were to stay here it would be because we needed to not we don't have any interest in conquering the city unless that is the will of the flame so if you were to consider it the will of the flame you would conquer the city regardless of what the people living here want the night captain speaks up well until five minutes ago we didn't know that a member of the royal family was still alive and now you're telling us a bunch of gobbledygook about her being some kind of monster or something like that well evidently we got something to sew it straight because if indeed the Vaughan castles still live then by all rights we ain't got no authority here what I were just here to help what I also know is that regardless of what happened to the Queen we don't know what happened to her children and we're here to find that out Drexel speaks up you're not hiding any of your children are you no currently the Queen is under our protection but she is not where is she we're not answering we're not answering that because there is a possibility of information getting to the wrong people and so far we haven't made up our minds on who we can trust any we can't I'm very happy that the three of you sitting here under the zone of truth have proven to at least believe that you are not giving information to any other sources the reason why you were not given this information sooner was because exactly that we had been told that there was a leak of information within your lines therefore we took it upon ourselves to protect the most valuable asset we had found that being said the Queen is in no condition do anything right now we found a monster we fought a monster that monster tried to kill us that monster was not the queen and until we can find out what and what has happened to the actual Queen this situation is under our protection and you need to start treating us with a little respect because we are a group fighting for the same thing as you and protecting the same thing as you and so far have done a better job of protecting it way I see it you three haven't decided whether or not you like this man or not whether you trust this man or not I think all of us are just looking for the same thing to be perfectly honest and you seem to be making it more complicated than needs to be if I'm ever given information that there's a leak in the lines I need to question that and I need to solve that puzzle before I decide who can receive vital information that makes sense that is a tactical option that makes sense and you can't argue that you three have a Caspian with you how do I know that this Caspian isn't pulling the strings on this whole thing gonna tape the Queen and marry her off - then the Caspian would have complete control over the new dealt my intention for letting a Caspian do that your friend isn't he but Drakon hime how do you know he's my family I can trust him he saved our lives many times he's fought for us he's fought by her side he has held me well I almost died and fed me a potion this man is my best friend and I care about him more than I care about most other people I've met here I trust him with my life me too and I don't think he's going to stab us in the back and I think he's put his life on the line more than the lanterns have put for theirs for either of us untouched not gonna die I did want to abandon the Queen when we first found her 100% but I came around he killed a troll I thought at least one troll to save us it was actually for a bet it was kind of a bet it was sort of a gambling thing I guess there was more to save rats I want to bring it back to the idea behind why the land or why the sacred flame wants anything any relics from here and why your foothold needs to be here and why after 15 years why not the day after the meteor hit why it's taken us 15 years to get out here your guess is as good as mine but I had to guess if anything past 15 years have been necessarily been kind around this world what with all the wars all the combat all the fighting this whole cities laying fallow for years and years the Lord Commander Drexel he hasn't it's true perf if it really has only been in the past five years that even within the hooded lanterns we've been able to mount a coherent operation we've only had our barracks at Shepards gate reclaimed for a couple years now for years and years the city was a wasteland and swallowed up anybody that dared approach it there's been 15 years of war bloodshed people fighting over the carcass of the remains of this kingdom trying to decide who could Caspian zhilie Rian's the west of ours all of us have been fighting and killing each other for 15 years trying to decide who's going to be in control of the city and no one's actually been able to control it and then three little as you called us mercenaries wandered in and suddenly Drakon Heim is looking more and more like it might be able to be fixed now you might believe that friend I do but there's a lot of work to be done no Gary's so self congratulatory it's too soon now my boys here told me if impressive things about you all and your skills but there were a long way off from even saying the city's even in a semblance of control you know you could go up there and die and everything you've worked for everything you think you've achieved would be gone overnight and no one would know where the Queen is because you want telling us there's three of us Drexel I agree I think you need to tell me where the Queen you don't need to tell me now but when this meeting is over I need to know where she is you need to figure out who is dirty in your ranks before we're gonna tell you anything somehow the Queen's men knew where we were and where we were gonna be when the hooded lanterns are the only ones who know I'll deal with that problem once you do I will give you that information that's the deal to start treating us with respect we've treated you with respect this whole time we're doing great work and you know it we are helping we are on the same side that's what you think is he telling the truth he looks like it you would have in the run going in a through up through our gate we've been nothing but kind of you working with you except for the fact that one of your men gave us up and we could have died not because of the monsters but because the information your people are giving out fortunately you didn't and I'll do a better job of that and that's because of our skill work together and we're gonna continue working together I need to know where the Queen is well then we work together affair fine repair rent what we've been holding up our part of the deal if you were if you found out you were working with another group and you found out that information that you gave to that group whether it was through the commander or one of their high ranking members was leaked what would your actions be would you continue to just give valuable information to that group you're an outlier and if you were under my command I would demand answers of you if he was under your command we wouldn't have done nearly any of the work we've done so far it's debatable no that's fact we're gonna zone a truth zone a fact zone of facts night captain I have nothing more to say to these three I'm willing to deal with you in good faith but these three are willing to even come to the table as far as I'm concerned they can leave this meeting we're willing to come to the table with them we're here we're here to fight for Drakon Heim we're here to restore Drakon Heim yes we're doing a better job than the hooded lanterns so far so we're here there's three of us get used to it which is too bad because the hood and lanterns stand for something so good for jackin hime and the fact that they're letting their egos get in the way is causing harm to what we our group stands for I think you need to think about that commander we're here in a zone of truth you're hearing the good word of me and my closest captain's and you won't give me a straight answer I've many more to say to you I've given you only but the truth the night captain speaks up I don't know what to make of this myself seems like you three and the Lord Commander can go tit for tat I just want to know frankly I'm impressed with the three of you I'd like to work with you I'd like out to see all of us working together right now but I don't see that how that's possible if you're not gonna tell him what he wants to know and to be perfectly honest I agree with them I think you should be telling them where the Queen is I don't need to know where she is I'd like to know so so both of you leaders of groups of military think it's okay that with a leak of information within one of those groups it's okay to give possibly the most important information that Drakon Heim has heard to that group that possibly has a leak you may commander with respect I can tell you as a commander and as another commander you three are wild cards no matter how good your word is no matter how good your swords are no matter how faithful your spells might be you are not under this man's command you are not under my command and any commander is gonna tell you that they're gonna trust those under their own command whether more than a wild card like you that's just the way of it I trust my men implicitly I would trust them till the end of the world and yes if I knew that there was someone against me in my order I would be very distressed about and I would take it very very seriously that's what we're asking and until that time it doesn't make sense for us to give the most important information we have until that's a hundred percent resolved way I see it bigger liability in the situation is you because there's far more that there's that the Lord Commander here can do about one of his old men and he can do about you this stage of the game the Lord commander said bristles at that and says no there's plenty that I can do about these three Oh think you underestimate our abilities and our knowledge of the city that I've grown up in and the skills of your warriors but ultimately commander my goal my number one concern is the Queen's safety and if that is my concern she is not going anywhere near the lanterns that is my concern too that's why I need to know that's why I need to bring her under my protection wherever it is you're keeping her is no safer then under my care and protection the safest place for our queen is with her guard who has sworn an oath to protect her and the fact that you believe that that's truth knowing that there is a mole concerns me that truth is the only thing we have it's the only thing that we have can I ask you a question commander and I'd like to remain on as decent a terms as we can here honestly the condition that the Queen has found herself in is something that we have left in the hands of somebody who knows about how to deal with delirium she is infected with a sickness that I don't think anybody within your ranks has the means to solve and bring this person in with them to will protect both of them if you think that you found someone that can help her that's a fantastic will put your doctor under guard Lord Commander philia read here's the finest healer I've ever met if there's anybody in the world that can do anything for your queen it's her I worry that everybody wants the Queen but no one's telling that's what you're gonna do to her or do with her I think it's all well and good protection and in say me but she was gone for 15 years we found her we're the only ones that went in there looking for her and and now you all you all fight over like a prize this isn't this isn't some trophy for Illyria this isn't some relic to guard this is a person and right now she's and she's in the best the best care she's hidden and no one knows where she is but us and I think it needs to stay that way for now make your persuasion check 16-1 philia reads visa i don't know if the three of you had the best judgment in what's right for the queen but I agree with what you say she's a woman she's a person she's a human she was whatever it is she does not deserve to have two to louts of lout lack men fighting over her like some kind of prize if anything when she comes to you'll need to answer to her little commander now I want to do what's right here I've seen too many people throw their lives away in the sea I've seen it consumed folk I've heard the things I've seen the hurt that people done and they've what's right there's a whole bunch of folk they're coming in this city with a promise that they'll be saved down there you've seen them yes we've met them yes there's a whole bunch of folk here think that they're doing we'll try it and nobody really knows what they're doing that's all I know we have to trust that the light in our hearts and our souls will show us the way and I believe you when you say that you think you are doing what's best and what's right I don't know what you're doing is what's best and what's wrong but I believe you and I know that you thank you now you two and these two men you can all Baker as much as you like and you're gonna have to deal with that but what's happened to that woman we've been conducting research on the Hayes and Dragan Heim and the effects it's having whatever happened to her I don't have a straight answer for you but the meteor crash the delirium and the haze have somehow affected her in ways that we've never quite seen before a lot of the mutants and creatures that you've been burning down may have been people once that's something we're trying to figure out there's a lot of mysteries in dragon high right now the queen is one of them and we're just trying to get her the best care and do you think we can save them yes I would like to rule out any and all possibilities before I go murdering them I want to find out what happened to tracking Heim and I want to see if there's a way to undo what the delirium and the haze of Const you three have the potential to do some good work here in this city but right now you don't know who you want to work with you don't know who to trust I don't blame you but we got to decide here what to do next we need to decide whether we're gonna work together or we're gonna keep bickering about this because we all have a different way of thinking what's right if I can bring us back to the topic on hand with the burning of the city so a way that we can go about this without burning down drakon Heim with the information that you've now been given that there is a lot of work being done here to restore a dragon hunt the Lord Commander take the knight commander takes over from here look it now I don't have any intention nor do I have the resources to burn down your entire city what we have with us in our supplies is only enough for us to secure and control the cathedral st. matru yo and our next target is that temple gate because this man over here won't let us through Shepards gate and I tell you he's stubborn and as far as I know he's not gonna let you through that gate either now that you won't tell him what the queen is so we're both at an impasse so if I might offer to you you can keep the Queen under your control for now but you help us take temple gate you help us get to the grand Cathedral you don't need to work with him anymore there are certain items in that Cathedral that belonged to caspia and there are certain items in that Cathedral that must stay in Drakon Heim and must stay in the hands of those who are of dragon height I need assurance that you won't be taken any of dragon Himes items or cos pious we will turn over anything that we that is the right property of the dragon high royal family to the dragon high royal family and to no one else No what if we have a member of the royal family what's problem we can deliver those items to them that was our original plan we would like to deliver those items to her there's things that need to be protected you're not from Drakon Heim so why would we let them fall into your hands over members of this city era we may be not in good books with the commander but I still align with his beliefs of what is so usually right to do with this city you're just going to help them now you're just gonna turncoat I didn't say that I'm saying that you commander I believe what you believe is correct that dragon home should be left to dragon hime but we seem to be at odds with our current decision right now the three of you had the biggest heads I've ever seen you three think that you three and you three alone get to be the ones that decide what's best for the city like you three and you three alone could do anything just walk over everybody here but there is an order to this city there was an order to this city and that order is what it's founded on and it needs to be respected and you're just gonna trash all over that where's our respect commander for any of the work that we've done you'll get respect when it's given an order that can keep order - and who's the judge of whether we deserve respect is it you as the only surviving ranking officer of the small Council of the city of drackett I'm absolutely well we don't know that you're the only surviving one you're the only face right now you're not the only surviving one I know you think your father is still alive I know my father was a lot inflamed but he is your father your father is a good man but he's a glorified Butler when it comes to matters of military import I am the authority on the small Council even if he survived it would be my decision to make I'll make sure to report your attitude and your willingness to work with us to the Queen once she's come to seeing as in 15 years none of your men were able to find her but yet we just went for a walk in the park we're able to retrieve the Queen but hey I guess that doesn't deserve a lot of respect Knapp doesn't and the Queen respects my father more than anyone and trusts him had you brought her to me directly she'd be dead for all we know for all you know perhaps you just can't wrap your head around the fact that the Queen is under our protection and you don't like that [Music] you three think that you are the movers and shakers do you think that you've done all this a little bit we've done something that nobody else has and were we think it's worth all the blood and lives that have been spent in this city already all the people that had to fight and die for what little we have of it right now to keep this place safe if it weren't for the hooded lanterns Everwood Village would have been overrun twelve years ago completely if it weren't for the hooded lanterns there wouldn't be any foothold in Shepherds gate if it weren't for me and my soldiers dying every day there wouldn't even be a semblance or a hope of any control here so when you say that you think we haven't done anything I am found Lee insulted okay so we're all insulted then so that's great it's even and yet you still won't to address you know you're talking about big heads in this room and we came to you saying you have a mole so we don't want to give you information and you've just been pigheaded about that since the moment we brought that to your attention I think it needs to be dealt with much more elegantly and I thought we were on the same side until you got all up in our face about the fact that we are being cautious with important information and that to me is just smart we're being smart about our decisions we're trying our best I do to prove to you that I that information is going to be safe bring all your soldiers Arizona truth every single one of them we just did look commander where I think we're going around in circles and there's a lot of he said and you want this and you want that what you need to know is that the queen is safe and that we're here to protect her as well and we don't want any harm to come to her and I do think you take this matter seriously but now is not the time to decide the Queen's fate we need we have a big Noll problem we have some new friends from Illyria who are here looking to take the Cathedral and you're making it difficult for them to do their job why not let's figure out how we can save Drakon hime together as a family if everything they say is true that means that since the Queen is alive they have no rain here meaning that if they are just here to help us get rid of our null problem which we have all agreed would require an army perhaps there is an option for all of us to work together to make Drakon hime safer and if they agreed that the relics within that Cathedral will go to the rightful owners this means that it could be a win-win situation a win-win-win situation three wins Mimi all three of us win as long as drag and I went and drank and I wins and that's what we're all here to talk about and that is what we all want or commander I'm interested what do you propose we have some connections as long as they're not dead to get in and out of the city if Lord Commander will allow us we can continue using that route we can find out more about the Cathedral at this moment I'm actually going to use mold earth to make words appear on both of your rock my rock that basically just says do we let them or like plan questionmark we go underground they draw out Noel's question mark yes yeah let them know yeah yeah what we're proposing is we are a small team and there are benefits to being a small team the reason why we've been able to accomplish what we have is because we can get in and out of places without making a lot of noise I'm we get in and out of places easier because we're a small team because of that if we can draw most of the nulls away from the Cathedral we might be able to access it through underground routes there for clearing out what's left of the nulls inside the Cathedral and hitting them from behind and securing the Cathedral for all of us then we and the two commanders go into the Cathedral together and we all get what we want openly so that we all agree that everybody's getting what they want from that Cathedral good plan so you're saying you want me and my men to form some kind of distraction you are gonna march on temple gate anyway we think that that's enough to draw the nulls out if you're taking down their gate they're going to send forces to try to stop that especially if it's an army approaching so your plan that you already had just needs to continue you have you putted lanterns help we have an even better chance of wiping out the Noles at temple gate and a bigger force means they're gonna send more troops leaving underground open for a small force which is what we're best at to go in scout it out scout it out destroy any Knolls that are hanging around there and make sure that it is secure and maybe even be able to hit them from behind and help out in that way together three strikes the hooded lanterns the paladins and the three crows strikeforce strikeforce strikeforce the Lord Commander says you're saying the hooded lanterns and the silver order attack devil gate together as a family well you three go under the Cathedral and do what up through the catacombs they will leave Knowles there to protect the relics we're gonna clear those out that's something that we can do and then we're going to want move on temple gate from there well the war is happening we can hit their back lines yeah this is like a kind of also a slash brainstorming session yeah I'm open to other ideas but you can kind of see where work we have a plans like for the foundation we have a good foundation for a plan that involves all three of us working together and all three of us winning 30% of a plan I'd say we have 75% of a plan Thank You pluton it's a big okay I'll give it 48 the 60s deal 67 we'd like to secure control of both temple gate and the Cathedral we don't want to just cause a distraction so you can get in there and sneak out something we actually want to secure that hole inside we're going to together kill the Lord of the feast is that his name yeah and and the Knowles ownership of temple gate and the Cathedral I worry they try to hit both sites at the same time and stretching our forces thin we have more forces now though it's true you'll be hitting them from the front even with our men and paladin's doing a strike on temple gate from both sides it's going to be tough do you have any means to help us under title gate are you asking for an explosion because I tend to be quite good at those no no we we can't entertain the possibility of actually destroying the gate we probably need it as extra secure the city itself noted it one I don't think we have the firepower for that anyways we could get definitely siege to it and with our aerial support and with our ground troops you know the nulls don't have proper siege preparations in place which I've never known an old to have that kind of intelligence we could probably with take it it would be bloody we'd have a lot of losses but between our Griffins the hooded Lantern's can come in from the sides strike force try get someone in there throw the gates open hmm we could take it we could take it together one other thing the gate and the wall are made of stone meaning that they can stand up to fire pretty well now I don't want you burning the whole city down but we've agreed that you're not here to do that but burning those Knolls at a temple gates is a possibility you have the means to do that we do probably gonna have to break the gate in the process but we could repair it we held it that would be ideal if it means killing all the Noles in temple gate I've got one more question for you commander which cleaner night commander captain commander you say you want to take the Cathedral but what's your plan to deal with the delirium no I don't rather know from him there I suspect our next target is to try to do what we can about that crater I've heard that there's no end of the corruption coming out of that thing so it's not just the Ryland City oh it's our first goal but once we're in the city if we secured this kind of foothold on the city if we work together and we actually gain a foothold in the middle of the city then perhaps all of us could work together and we can retake other parts of the city by working together we could find out what's in the crater we could make the route safe for any of them pilgrims or find out what they're up to there we could investigate that old mage tower and see what if there's any knowledge left there may be in that mage tower there's some resources or magic that we could use I make a frowny face appear on both of your rocks and say amethyst Academy foothold frowny face I think we should take it one step at a time the the knight commander the Lord Commander speaks up and says it's true though we did collaborate if we can do this in good faith and we have the Queen and you you and the silver order are actually committed to working productively with us then we could gain a foothold in the city we would actually have a chance if we should secure both temple gate and Shepherd gate Sheppard's gate we'd have the entire west side of the city we could strike forward and deal with the problem with the Noles then from there we could could secure the Academy district we could secure the foundry district to secure the crater we could work together from there and eventually get towards the castle to who knows what resources we could find in the mage tower as well if we can't get even close to it they might have some magic that we could use some power in some way perhaps even there something in the tower that we could sell back to of them that would give us the foot they the resources that we need to keep moving I like I like your train of thought Lord Commander I like the idea of starting with the like I like the start of our plan I do think it would be important that the Academy falls back to the amethyst Academy as they are the best ones to run that place I mean the Academy they they haven't shown any interest in the city at all I'm sure if they had access back to their Tower I used to go to school with with the Academy a long time ago didn't really do too well but he telling them about how you dropped out of I didn't drop out kicked a look at I got kicked out there was an incident as far as that they're concerned you know the only dealings I've ever had with the atom at the the amethyst Academy they they rot like freak me out to be perfectly frank they're kind of freaky they're godless godless heathens as far as I'm concerned they're all up into their arcane gobbledygook I don't make heads or tails of it the powerful we they do some strange things if they I wouldn't want to run their ire but if they have some valuable in that tower that would be useful for us who they're wealthy they got a lot of stuff going on like you said they do weird things and their magic is strange and foreign to you whatever they have in that Tower stuff that they know how to use not only that but where what has happened to Drac and I'm involving the Delirium in the haze is also weird and possibly requires an arcane look as weird as you might think they are they might be the best people to deal with this haze issue we're getting off topic we should phone oh I'm well as short-sighted we night I agree but I think maybe there's a way that we can bring many factions together maybe we all just come back to how we had it before Drac and i'm fell there doesn't need to be one group leading all of Drakon hime it used to be a city where the mages had their Tower the hooded lanterns had their watch the paladin's weren't here but you know they're helping with fairness is true what they say we are all united under under the light a single goal I don't know how I feel about this to be perfectly honest I'm not happy about what's going on with Queen Lenore noted I understand your frustration it's got some more polite way of saying noted but yes as far as our Lord Commander night commander if we do work together I came at her with respect these three well talented are obstinate and with your assistance I feel that we should arrest them and keep them under guard until they are willing to divulge the location of the Queen that really won a deed yeah that seems inappropriate after we we've literally just been sitting here working out a plan that helps all of us and now suddenly you want to arrest us the night commander speaks up you three are smart but your hearts your minds and on the right place and I'm inclined to agree I think you three should stay here until you're willing to actually work with us in a four Roth way we just said we were gonna work we just agreed to work with you uh-oh and we'd like to to be perfectly frank I think all of us could work together really really well but I don't feel like you're dealing with all of us in good faith and I feel that you need to make you and Laurel commander and all of us we have to come to an accord on this business with the Queen and I think of all this I'm confident that Lord Commander between the hood lanterns and our troops we could take temple gate we would just secure that and then we could move forward in march on the Cathedral together just making a life together and then they've banded these three straight up they're wild cards I agree with you and they're not willing and they think that they can control this whole situation we were just the mediators of this entire discussion you guys were at ends and were the ones who came up with a plan that helped all of us now you're gonna throw us under the wagon the truck the horse-drawn carriage the the night commander the looking we need you to be dealing with us in good faith this is a good plan this is a solid plan but we need to be able to trust each other if it's all gonna work you trust this plan to work do you think this plan is gonna work why are you why aren't you worried about some mole and the hooded lanterns giving word to the queen of thieves and then disrupting the entire thing because I think the queen of thieves is smarter than you give her credit for we've seen a lot of different factions in this city and so far each one has their own reasons for being here in Drakon hime we've been in the middle of all of it so we're neutral in the terms of talking to all these factions what we've seen are different groups all fighting for what they think is right and none of them willing to work with each other nevertheless I think I think y'all should lay down your weapon you should surrender your weapons and I think you should we should take in until you're actually willing to work with us in an honest way ah no I I have one more proposal if we take temple gate and we're successful the new the the new Holy Trinity they like that stuff right yeah then we will update you on the progress of the Queen we will check in with her baby steps and see if her condition has improved and if it has and you guys keep your word and none of this queen of thieves funny business goes on then we can feel comfortable giving you more and Lord Commander one more thing just on good faith Lord Commander not 9 commander just on good faith when we do retrieve the items that belong to dragon hime I do believe that they are best left in your hands and if the Queen has come to and is well enough I do think that it's appropriate that the hooded lanterns are the ones to deliver those items to them you can hand deliver it but will tell you that information once temple gate is taken and we are in that Cathedral you can make persuasion Jax [Music] you go first 24 for I only halfway believe you I'm inclined to agree I think y'all better lay down your arms and tell you're willing to work with us properly I've got one more suggestion what if we bring the Queen to you instead of telling you where she is before the operation before we make the attack yes you go and bring her here before the operation do you think here is the safest place for her commander I think that if we do bring her we do not let anyone outside of this room know who she is I'll feel you read speaks up again it says there's a there's an old mill where a bunch of adventures I have no idea oh I can't say you bring the Queen there if the Queen if somebody outside of this room finds out about the Queen I'll know that you're anyone in this room is not worth trusting and it will be your head that I will take because the Queen is the most important thing here I also need to be very very honest about something since we're in the zone of truth I'm gonna reiterate that when we obtained the Queen she was extremely sick the hope was that she would get better there is also the possibility and this is an unknown to us at this time that we could go back and she could be worse or dying or some situation we will assess that situation and perhaps with a great healer here we still might be able to bring her before you what I can't promise you is the state that the Queen will be and we found her in a horrible State we've improved that state but she is sick and you need to understand that all right click on whatever why did you ooh night commander we will begin our preparations you should too before the attack you will bring the Queen into our custody and then it's to the battlefields with us all immediately we will secure her make sure she's safe we'll figure out where well we can't waste any time agreed agreed for Drakon hime yeah and there's a shaking of the hands strike force oh god buddy it got real buddy this is one of truth and it's all murky one of two directions I'm glad it went this one I think it could have gone a million other directions that it I don't know I'm that was rough that was hard we weren't going to jail that was for sure exhausting zone of truth honesty is hard I think it's gonna suck when you have to do something like oh man or no now now I say that we're more in favor of we might have to blow up the hooded lanterns we also have the problem with the amethyst Academy they don't want anybody getting a foothold we lack everybody we open the doors no guys I now understand what we're fighting for a united dragon hi miss Academy was is now the outlier are the new paladin's politics yeah we just want to go kill him well with that yeah that's that's some very uncertain place for us to be left on that wraps it up for this evening right tonight's argument yes Jill Kelley and Joe aka Vale Sebastian and pollute oh and a huge thank you to Kyle

being left without their questions answered oh I'm so having that Southern drawl you turn it on no that's great the only thing I have to say is like having the commander the night commander and the Lord Commander in the same conversation good I apologize for all the times where the voices got mixed they ended up being way closer than I thought no you did really great awesome yeah I think it was

by door and forge I got a foe we need to add a lake to jackin hime if anybody has any suggestions on where the lake is the drain River is technically wide enough for ships it's it sticks needs an upgrade and we attack by boat but but it's it is a river that eventually drains out into the sea but then there's another city there that is where the actual boats and harbors dock with them is just trade vessels that used to go up the drain so I guess I could have a boat there it would just feel weird it is it is a wide river it's a huge river and it's a cool boat right well eventually you will find a way to use the boat stay tuned no pirates pirates action actually the new book shadows ghosts of salt marsh yeah is the new D&D book I'm so excited well you know I started off trying to write a pirate campaign I don't think it's a part campaign though I could make it a pirate in any case thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time in the ruins bye [Music]
