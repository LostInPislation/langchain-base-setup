get him tiger fantastic when last we left our heroes they had ventured deep into the ruined city into Queens Park Gardens a verdant and mutated garden in the heart of Drakon Himes ruins there beneath the grotto of Queen Lenore they found none other than the former queen of Drakon hime Lenore herself who had been hiding in her grotto for who knows how long since the city was destroyed managing to subdue the queen who had been changed by the Delirium omitting herself the radiant forces of delirium that almost threatened to do our heroes in they managed to subdue her and bring her back to their tower where they planned their next move having secured several eldritch lilies their original objective in visiting Queens Park Gardens our heroes are now have now ventured to one of their earliest contacts the hedge wizard Oscar yeren whose research into the delirium was the reason why our heroes sought out the eldritch lilies in the first place for Oscar urine claims that with the potent pollen or materials of the eldritch lilies he is able to fashion a potion which will protect someone against the effects of the haze the radiant mist which has infested the ruins of Drakon Heim and saps the strength of those that seek to explore the ruins and indeed rapidly can kill those who approach the most dangerous areas of the city such as the castle the mage tower and the crater itself with both a horde of eldritch lilies in hand and Queen Lenore blindfolded our heroes have ventured back to read manner to cut a deal with Oscar urine having revealed to Oscar the identity of lenore our heroes are now in the midst of a difficult negotiation for of course Oscar urine does not know that our heroes are working for the amethyst Academy who would sooner see Oscar Joran dead and his research in their hands than anything else so let's find out why it's gonna happen next oh man that was a recap yeah I prepared that was great um okay so you have all ventured now into the dilapidated Reed Manor and Oscar urine the hedge wizard has invited you down to his laboratory at this dank dungeon underneath the manner that is equipped with all manner of racks surgical tables vials and shelves of all manner all chemical ingredients and the desiccated corpses of urines latest experiments seated on one of the cleaner surgical tables is Leonor her black dress ruffling up her blindfold still in place and she's swaying gently almost losing sense of her reality as oscar yeren eyes her up he's a bedraggled moderately pudgy man with pale face and his eyes just glow with a hint of delirium that he has been constantly imbibing this black goatee around his pallid kind of pudgy flesh of his face as he eyes are up and down looking at intermittent moments at the surgical tools arrayed on the table beside him he turns to you and says so you've brought me eldritch lilies and the queen of Dragon I'm what do you want from me I feel like we've been in this basement long enough it feels like months I just woke up so listen here Oscar yeah I try to remember everything that I said 30 seconds ago but also 30 days ago yeah we've given you these lilies you and I are gonna need to start working together we're both men of magic and we're both after the same thing we want to know what the effects of the haze are on the city in exchange for this many elders lilies because you asked us to bring you a few we've brought you a bagful he nods hopefully they won't die while they're here but I'll see what I can do in exchange for that I need some samples of your potion that you've been working on to test I can be your field research I am my field research I can tell you the potion works I would like to see that for myself fine you've brought me these eldritch lilies they will provide me with the raw materials I need to make more of these potions I have a few already created from the last time I had some eldridge lilies in place I'll give you three now and I'll make more as long as we continue to have a productive working relationship I think that you having these potions and risking your lives and the ruins that will work in my favor but if you have these I want what you're gonna get with these potions in hand you're gonna be able to visit parts of the city that no-one's been that in 15 years the crater the mage tower the castle I want to know everything you find on top of that though we still have the issue of the Queen as well yes Oscar urine look sir up and down my queen she is suffering from whatever has happened to her I don't know what I can do I'll be honest with you what she's been exposed to I'm not even sure she understands it she'll be an experiment at best that's all I can promise you I'll do my best with her and perhaps perhaps some of the treatments that I've applied to myself I could apply to her and see if that reverses the effects of whatever's happened to her over the years I built up my own innate resistance hence I'm able to live here but what's happened to her is far more drastic I couldn't say if it'll take it could take years if at all to do anything for her as long as you do your best to keep her alive and can we loosely use the word experiment can you more like treat yeah my queen just like that that choice of words we want you to be really super careful also please don't tell anyone that she's here of course and neither should you did anyone see you or you followed here no if the hooded lanterns find out that I have her it'll be the end you know that it'll be the end of the Queen and I want to make sure that doesn't happen hmm why do you think that we've got our notions we got our ears around the city there's something going down and we don't know who to trust so we're trusting you to keep your mouth shut and make sure thank you heard of them because we're not sure who we can trust within the hood lanterns hmm smart there's one last thing Oscar since I'm going to be field testing your research and since we're we have a working relationship now I'm going to need access to some of your notes not going to ask you for all of your research but I need access to notes regarding the effects of delirium what you found and I might need to copy down a few of those why why because I'm a man of research myself and it's gonna help me better understand what's happening out there actually he's a man of magic you said it earlier science and magic they're the same they're the same science and magic Ludo you wouldn't understand I don't but I think what we're looking for is ways that if there are effects if there's something goes wrong we need to be able to potentially treat it and I think Sebastian is gonna be the best person to be able to interpret what that would be when we get to that point also we might need to make more of these potions in a rush and it would be nice to have the ability to do that even like a rough one so when we're out in the field to make sure that we can get that stuff back to you know what we find no no the research is mine we don't want the secret ingredient just like like you already know what the secret ingredient is oh yeah we do to backseat blood I wasn't talking about that but he kind of winces for a moment and we got plenty of that well actually could you use the taxi blood and to help you with the Queen are you offering I already offered I'd offer to save my queen I would do anything I just give up my friends blood yes I need more okay okay in exchange for some of your notes yes I'll let you choose but I need the basic research on delirium that you've done we don't have to go too deep into your breakthroughs or anything like that just the field notes to advance our working relationship I don't think so no well then why would we give you more blood your treasure hunters aren't you you're just here for the ruins I'm here to find out what happened to dragon home I'm here to protect the city and it's priced quick you have these notes what are you going to do with them read them and then what memorize them and then what use them we're in what laboratory where are you working from do you have a base of operations if so I'd like to see it where's your laboratory where your materials where's your equipment if you're going to make use of these notes where are you working on them from can you're currently setting up a laboratory in the clock tower and we're looking for some backers you want to get on the ground level of our new watchtower laboratory and that's a great place to do testing because it's right in the middle of the haze yeah are you being honest is that your intent I am telling him what I believe he needs to hear okay give me a deception just as much honesty we could do it it's not my bedroom 24 the clock tower you know you're living in the clock tower it's our base of operations at the moment yes slash laboratory slash laboratory Thank You Pluto be high above the haze you could rest there secure defended fortified you can observe the crater that's a good place to set up shop thank you we also have assistants that will die and you can throw things off the top and it's really fun how droll all right you have equipment some what do you have it's a little subtle little Sebastian's potion it can kick it's like a is a good junior adventurer little Swensen burner and it's got a little vial you're going to need far more than that if you're gonna make any use of any of my my things look at what I have all around me okay I can't remember but there was a bunch of stuff in that room with the motor ons yeah yeah an obelisk yeah we have an obelisk do you have an obelisk no yeah we have one yeah we're and what do you use it for so far it's burned a person to death that's a heat source exactly yeah I have a few vials and a Bunsen burner we have others you're not you keep coming back to me you've brought me this Queen I have to admit I don't know what to make of you who are you working for I'm working for myself I'm working for these two were a team all three of us came to Drakken hime hoping to figure out what happened here and to restore some form of peace to this city although that seems incredibly unlikely we're still here to analyze the situation and figure out what our best course of action is and so far unwillingly you've been one of our best allies well I suppose if you're and you want me to babysit the Queen while I work on her you are the leading professional in research on the haze therefore you are the most likely person to save her babysitting is not the word I would use we're giving you the honor of possibly being the person who saves Dragonite can you imagine what the Queen will bestow upon you if you restore her to her rightful place on the throne the power the riches the purse is true yes if anyone could shield me from my enemies would be her and you'd have our support as well and if we continue doing our job hopefully we'll be as renowned as you and we can all live happily ever after in a new dragon hood fine so much candied salmon well have you heard about those paladin's that are inside the city heard of them yeah you heard those crazy cultists that are following this falling fire business I have we've talked to a couple you know working with any of them no you're not spying on me for the hooded lanterns No you're working for the queen of Thieves aren't you we have killed way too many people that's a that's a road I don't know if we can reverse on anymore yeah we're pretty committed to the whole she hates us thing I don't think the queen of thieves is gonna be ours right all like the band like the Benton isn't like the gold and fine especially the halflings I'll be right back he turns down the hallway opens up a gate it's on the other side of the laboratory and heads down a darkened hallway the turns and beers for a moment and he leaves you there for a few minutes I think that went well good call with the riches that's good I mean if anybody can give him riches would be the queen it's it's true Bluto good job on the selling the tower I have one afterthought what because we told the hooded Lanterns that this the queen is like some cult follower yeah does she has she still have any identifying marks or traits the Queen yeah she has her necklace yeah I don't think we can take that from her no but either I was thinking Baio maybe you want to take it or maybe we need to hide it cuz if someone came here and saw her with the necklace they're immediately gonna know who she is potentially we have more leverage if if she stays kind of like off the radar yeah do you know what I mean that makes sense is there anything else that tells her apart from just another face he's I mean her face is pretty she's missing eyes and no she's not missing eyes anymore alright think your battery back that's the rules of how to deal with the Queen so he doesn't die but ya know I think the necklace is really the only thing we have the signet ring that identifies like the royalty of Drakken home that would really be the only two things which we should keep that signet ring pretty hidden you mean on my hand speaking when or speaks up and says are you leaving me with this doctor yeah he's gonna help you my queen he is our one hope and getting you back to the state used to be we trust him with this so you should trust him what's happened to the city the city was destroyed by a meteor I remember I remember I remember when the guard said to run into the grotto there was a fire falling from the sky she grabbed her hand bail she said and she holds it and she says I remember your your father came and said he would come back that he had to go and find that he had to go and find the king and my children my queen do you know where they were when the meteor fell from the sky she thinks the castle they run the castle nobody's been able to get into the capsule since that day you have to go I will go but I need you to promise to stay here and try to get better because if we find your children and we find the king we don't want them to see you like this Shion she nods and she says thank you girl thank you I need to get better something's very wrong I don't quite feel like myself but I don't feel like I know who I was well we want to get you back to who you were and you don't feel like yourself because you've become something else so we're gonna try to get you back to our queen and I know that we can do it Oscar will try his best and we'll do anything to help you get back to the way you were and I you know with her hand still in my hand I take a really deep bow and I kind of like get down on the ground on one knee and say I would do anything to serve you my queen and I will find your children and your family she she points down to her her chest and she says in in the box the box she kind of reaches out she points in the wrong direction because you can't see for the blindfold she says take the portraits of my children then you'll know them they'll know that I sent them how bigger these portraits there's smaller ones they're like locket sized okay I like overhand when I go into her chest and I rummaged through and I try to find them yeah and I put them in my bag at least we'll know what they look like yeah that's helpful that's yeah that'll be important thank you my queen as you're going through the box going through why it's there Oscar comes back into the room and there's this rickety screeching sound as he's pushing this book this push cart the bottom box of them it's covered in is filled with these clinking vials and glasses and as he comes forward you can see that part that on top of the push cart there is a leather pouch that has been closed over and a pair of books and as he pushes them out he'll it comes back into the room and he holds up the book he says you can take this thank you and then he opens up the leather pouch and inside are three very strange contractions he opens the pouch up this glowing orange liquid the glow of it fills the room and you can see that there are three long thin vials maybe about four inches long and each of them has been set into a metal contraption the one end of it is a large plunger with a pair of metal hoops on one side the other is a sharpened needle about six inches long and he says this this here I call aqua exper ghio it is administered directly to the heart all right a suppository wouldn't have done or no I tried that it was it no we don't want to let's go up there other than my first go but yes a little bit of heartburn the strain of like pulp fiction's yes yeah cruel directly to the heart can admit us be administered in two ways preemptively or in an emergency in someone that is in the late stages of delirium sickness or poisoning you can administer one of these to them and it might save them if they're not too far gone otherwise you could you can inject it directly into the heart in advance so far the solution is relatively stable it lasts a few hours afterwards if you are exposed to delirium you piss pure fire and vomit black Vaught bile for about a day or two but it's better than the corruption staying in your system the fluid gathers up the infected flesh and blood in your body and then your body does what it does best and it comes out and it hurts like nothing else yeah I've done the juice cleanse before this is like I don't know what you're just selling me on here I've tried tried all those little naturopathic Caspian juice cleanse yeah yeah I get it yeah into the heart that's gone Oscar I have a question have you tried this on any of the corpses that haven't eco-post no it's too valuable okay use it when you need it and not before I have a question if if we've been out in the haze before are we kind of building up like haze in our blood almost certainly this probably means the first dose is going to be particularly painful on its way out because we've been in there we've been we've been digging around remember that trip we took by the mages tower where I almost died just by breathing I wonder what it would do to me since I've been in the haze for like you should be aware of if you feel a fever that's normal well your honor your body temperature will rise and you will sweat and your sweat will probably be a glowing orange that's normal cool perfectly normal it's it's fine don't think about it what isn't normal what should we be working out for that in just in case Sebastian has to administer some magical first aid on himself or on a willing test subject sorry I asked that again if there's something that's going wrong what does it look like mmm spasms convulsions seizures perhaps a stroke random surges of wild magic constipation diarrhea Saturday night yeah if the effects contact me if you have any effects lasting six or more hours I'd very much like to know if the effects that last that long you will probably find it very difficult to sleep after taking taking this I love your notes hard to and so so just so that you all know once you take this it will last until you take a rest so taking a short rest or a long rest and its effects and the first long rest you take after imbibing the this solution has no effect it's because of the pooping yeah it's because of what it does to your system yeah so you don't get any benefits no in fact you in fact you'll gain d3 exhaustion levels after the effects wear off potentially more depending on how much toxins you you it absorbs for you sounds so good sounds like I'm ready I yeah like let's and this is what River wanted us to test right she wants a field test of this potion right yes we could also just take Oscars word for it that it works or inject it into somebody willing to venture into the haze preferably somebody well-armored and confident it's too bad that I can't be a test subject not mad about it I don't think Pluto could either he doesn't have what it takes I did you know what's that well I didn't want to but do you think do you think you could I think he's gonna chicken out yeah I don't I don't know we'll need to find a willing to us who has the guts yeah strong inside and out I'm not it works Oscar urine says but don't use it frivolously what do you think you'll you you'll go to first well why not go to the source yeah a crater yeah never been there before me neither let me find you something shiny as this has all been happening I've been thumbing through the book you gave me does it look like legit notes on your thumbing through it opening it up and thumbing through it there's like some serious alchemical magical Arcana formulas that are happening inside here along with diagrams and ingredient lists you're gonna need to peruse it for a few hours to determine whether or not it's legitimate or not but it looks like at first glance it looks full of them if I passed you some if I passed you a textbook and told you that it was a book about astrophysics would you really be able to determine whether I was telling you the truth or not based on a thumbing through it is the title of the book astrophysics yeah no there's no title on this one all I'm saying to you is that you know you look through it and it's it's what you'd expect from magical research but whether or not anything in here is actually true or not or works you're gonna have to go through it Oscar I'm gonna take some time to read this book and for our working relationship I hope that this has some valuable information in it it's a summary of several of my early experiments and some of my first successes and you'll find in there a catalogue of things that definitely don't work can I keep it for now thank you see if there's any notes that you can give them to so to and from relationship Oscar also you know with regards to the Queen I know we talked about that a little bit how she's gonna be staying with you but don't let her take off the blindfold it's for your own safety as well sirs what is she capable of burning your eyeballs out he nods like through Armour spicy stuff it's a light a hot night glare it feels like you've been in the Sun a very long time on a very hot day it's like you're in the Sun and the Sun was like 20 feet away from you yeah I don't do well with sometimes yeah just be aware it might be part of your I don't want to use the word experiment treatment to examine that but just you know put on some really good sunglasses be cautious fine and she trusts you I asked her to trust you and can you hide the necklace like can you like we should take that we are worried that if someone comes along they're gonna be able to identify her by her jewelry because I could identify her by her jewelry hmm it's a very well-known piece it is I think it should stay with her it's one of the pieces of proof that we have that she is who she says she is I think even if we do ruins I have nothing can you hide it somewhere where if somebody comes and reads this place they won't find it I'll do my best hopefully it'll be hidden here with her she'll be staying down here I can't let her possibly get upstairs the hooded lanterns patrol this area they protect me and she'll be protected in many ways by her own Guardians by extension good it's the way it should be but they cannot know she's here no he will hold you personally responsible if they find out they will too and they will kill me if they find out I have her here they'll think that I did this to her listen we'll find someone to bring you back and then kill you again if it happens she's she's our muscle fine good then we have an accord yeah let's go test out this orange group heart yeah right into your heart oh wait I gotta give you my blood where we go all righty so he will take another sample of your blood rest a bit before heading out I know it exhausts me ah fine that's good such as you're welcome to stay here I could get some food too do you have any ale go upstairs and talk together yes I'll meet you guys up there so it sounds like with that Oscar urine does take a sample of vales blood once again he pulls out one of these syringes and bleeds you into a pail you can make a constitution saving throw 12 you do gain one level of exhaustion that said the it's later in the afternoon and you come upstairs gamma wordlessly brings you some bread and beer and the only words she says is got my eye on you three I don't trust you thanks for the bread marco zombie kind of lurches around collecting the plates after you finish eating thanks Marco sorry about the incident certainly zombie whole zombie thing hope life is a zombie it's okay what's your next move I guess after we rest up and get you unexhausted well you'll need to spend you'll need to stay overnight for that that's up to you you're the tired one I'm pretty tired you gave a few drops of blood and called it a day rough day for you yeah big day I think if we didn't do experiments at night that would actually probably be best as well so you want to wait till morning did we do the morning yeah and then head down to the gates that is run by the falling fire cult yeah we're outside the city right now yeah so we would go around the outside yeah if we bring up our map there so you are all up at number 7 yeah which is the read Manor it's gonna be a long journey but we're also we're gonna be venturing to ember wood afterwards with our all of our research everything that we've gathered we have a lot to take care of a number wood village we have a lot of things that we can do there so I think the crater is a good choice because after we're done we can just head straight down to amber wood village or do you think we should go in through Shepards way cut across the city and go to the crater and then go out champion this way the only thing that scares me is cutting through the city just puts us in a lot more danger there going around it's going to take a lot longer yeah and River is only there for certain amount of time she's waiting let she wait yeah I vote go through the city well I'm glad are a stealthy companion here has decided that marching through the city is a good idea I'm also your guinea pig so I feel like we also need a young bacon mm-hmm not just a test subject but uh another subject don't we do we need - she's the long-term exposure I'm not really science II yeah we're um we're using the Queen I we jotted down notes of her situation we won't have to say that it was with the Queen but when we talked to River we can say we found somebody alive after long-term exposure here are the effects and then we're gonna use Pluto as our test subject for the serum to see if it works so your your plan then is to go towards you test the serum near the crater itself oh yeah I guess we could we could also just like test the reverse thing or like I go stand in the crater for a while and then and then and then you stab me and see if it takes away the I feel like that would potentially do more damage to you or just really as a as like a preventative I think that we're gonna use it as a preventative and you're gonna just march right into the center of the crater and we'll see if we at least to the edge like you don't even have to go all the way my tiptoe in can I we're not gonna send you all the way into the crater we're just gonna close and if you start to feel any terrible effects like come out you know like if you start or convulsing and all of those other side effects you'll just let go of the rope and fall to your death and we won't know so I'll tie it around his waist and we can pull about that's much smarter we'll get trying to kill you we'll get an animal assuming that it might happen can you at least read the book before yeah can you at least stop skimming over your astrophys I flip through it there's some stuff in here about mixing chemicals I'm wondering sure I lied to him I don't actually know anything about mixing this stuff I just I just cast spells naturally I played up your potion yes thank you we got what we needed I have no idea what I'm doing at this research I was gonna say can you read it on the way because there's no point I have been reading it it makes no it's gibberish um one day I woke up and could cast hypnotic pattern I don't know how this stuff works you at least read like the side notes like the little stuff scribbled in like can you just try this looks like a picture there's a few words that you recognize in this text like and and and don't do this and I tried this it didn't work dad all of this equals death this page equals death there's a few descriptions of him testing various concoctions on test subjects and noting down how long they survived after he injected them with his latest concoction I understood I understand these pages he's killed a lot of people yeah yeah he has yeah he has but hey at least they all returned as zombies to serve him like as you go as you go through this probably murdered about 50 people just in this book like it's literally a confession of murder as you flip through it it describing about 50 people that he's killed I guessed it on I throw it in my bag well looks like this Queen situation is wrapped up nicely and she's dead he's dead we're bringing him back and we're murdering him again why wouldn't we bring the Queen back and escape bring her back plus bring him back and then kill him again since comes before yeah so you're walking through the dangerous city flipping through this book and I'm just needles right like it's one of those big thick like a Hornet yeah like the one that after it pulls like after it like comes out of your body there's gonna be a clear puncture mark where it went it bird caws we like ice related spell why's that you get at least freedom or cauterize can you cauterize the wound at least I can either cauterize it or I can I can chill touch your chest before here and then I don't gain possibly doing damage to you and then why use the thing but you won't feel it yeah then you won't feel it doesn't that prevent me from gaining hip points or something yes okay anyway so how long is it gonna take to go around the city versus through the city okay let's power through to be honest either will be but you've traveled the outer route around the city so many times it's just that if you want to go through the outer route to take Champions Gate into the South Ward if you haven't made any arrangements for getting through a Champions Gate that's what I'm worried about whereas you do have a deal with the hooded lantern for getting through Shepherds gate yep true yeah I still think that we have an in at champions gate not that that's the right choice but we did save a group of them the other the other areas of deep haze that you know of you've experienced the deep haze around the mage tower and you know that the old town has deep A's there as well so it's not like the great crater is your only choice that's true mehran the majors tower which is number 10 right yes that's what I just said that would be probably the easiest way we could it's the closest we could go through Sheppard's way run up to the tower test Pluto run back out Shepherds gate and then head down to Everwood village I say that's a good plan that's a quick plan Pluto I mean I feel like I don't have a lot of say in this you're the one that we're stabbing so where would you like to go would you like to get stabbed I would like to have the most comfortable place that I can expel everything wherever that is there's a lot of houses near the mages tower I'm sure you can find it so I just wanted my squad plays because if I go to the tower the way he described it I feel like it's gonna be like a bit of a journey for me it won't be right away it'll probably be a few hours later you guys help me well you don't want to be in the splatter zone [Laughter] the visor for the for the vomiting portion no he did he said it's gonna come out of vomiting no it's it's the way it's always use every available exit when with evacuating the building [Laughter] the Shepards way feel about about being the volunteer this is I hope cements the trust my colleagues I respect you my volunteer Muse tribute I know I'm kind of goaded on by Sebastian I respect you yeah so I do thank you okay and I know I'm the only quality subject and I'm the only one strong enough to take on the heart stabby thing it's show I wouldn't trust anybody else to do it because they'd probably die just from the stab but let alone get it yeah I think you're defeated at least one troll at least one yeah yeah you're right and if I can beat a troll I can be the needle I'm not scared of needles it's it's buried in there my lure okay so you've set off once again into the city heading through Shepard's gates the typical passing through the typical ordeal that you've agreed on with the hooded lanterns as you head back into the city one more time through their fortified position where they occupy the barracks there again crossing that little moat that they've set up outside the front portion of the gates going through the first half they close it open up the other half go through the others as you as you pass through one of the the hooded Lantern says guys are making pretty frequent trips in and out of the city lately you keeping busy yes yeah even though here every day you're braver maybe better than I thought what's your trick for living in the city being at the back see her it's mostly her veil I show them around there's good people good luck out there thank you people here that according to these you hear me oh you head back along Shepards way in the inner part of the city towards Market Street the intersection of the two main thoroughfares leading into Drakon Haim and as you look forward you can see the great Tower of the amethyst Academy the mage guild tower looming high over the northwestern part of the city and said the tower is over 300 feet tall it's a massive structure that its highest spire is even higher than the great Cathedral of Saint at Rubio and Castle drakon but it is that persistent oddity in the city for as always the center part of the tower has been smashed through and the top piece hovers precipitously over the rest in defiance of gravity deep gash middle where you can see a little rope ladder hangs down between but it points you quite clearly where the meteor impact is in the campus surrounding the mage tower is that your destination close enough to it that I know that last time we went into that area we hit Hayes pretty hard mm even towards the outskirts of Queens Park garden mm-hmm so as long as we get close enough to send Pluto into that haze that's our goal yep all righty get your notebook ready noted it's a rather dark day in Drakon Heim there's a light rain falling as you head into the city the mist of the delirium hangs rather heavily can only probably see about a hundred feet ahead of you down through the city streets as you get further in as you come closer and closer to the mage tower the haze becomes thicker and thicker and your visibility drops to maybe only about 50 feet ahead of you and as you navigate the twisting streets of the college district near the back alleys the narrow cobblestone streets all sort of meld together and a maze like fashion but Vale you're able to keep things pretty able to keep on top of everything and it's here that already gluto and sebastian you begin to feel the impact of the heavier hates I immediately pull out my handkerchief and tie it around my face again like last time only this time I won't take deep breaths yeah pollito what are you gonna do help the helmet the goggles do very little although the goggles help for the eye irritation that happens when you're running you're exposed to the haze but even breathing in the haze very much like it burns down your throat right it tingles through your body as you breathe it in and you start to feel just that that light pang of nausea as you walk through the haze like a good Scott it tastes like a good scotch in here the buildings of the area are mostly brown stones or fair tudor building tudor style buildings but many of them built with several storeys of stone and upper levels of slate shingling spire like as this was the area that that several of the majors and their families and people that catered to those of the mages guild lived as a finer district but the streets remain quite narrow what would you like to do for two you guys want to try this thing you're like what's gonna go go down how are you gonna do it Pluto I think I need you to strip down at least your breast plate I'm going to need to have access to your heart every time a man has said that to me with goggles I need access to your heart not without making it so we can't heal I just you just use your fingertip to gently yeah can you just at least give me some like bedside manner like just hold my hand I can hold your hand thanks I never really learned bedside manner oh gosh okay so so let me just just make sure I understand what your intent here is so your intent is to strip naked almost like you're gonna I just want to take off the okay nice armor and then Sebastian's gonna stab you with this horrific needle and inject you with this question will fluid and you're going to then what I'm going to I'm going to yeah do some alone jumping jacks or where these two going to be when you go into the haze way how far away is the D page break when you when you're when you're saying it all like this it really starts to make us question a lot more confident walking up I'm just worried about him passing out is like coming to a tie rope and if it pulls like your visibility is limited you about fifty feet and if you're gonna let him like how much time are you gonna spend in the haze Sebastian if you're gonna be exposed to the deep haze what are you gonna do what should stab yourself in the heart no I have three of these and we need to test this well do is uh I'm gonna I'm gonna walk around for an hour in the D pace alone and veo is gonna keep an eye out maybe I'm like the edge of it cuz like I can keep an eye on but only so far it still affects me it just not as bad the only thing that that might not tell you is it will if you're just on the edge of the D pays it will perhaps one suite if you're if you're satisfied with just knowing it works my solution every time we tie a rope to Pluto you hold the end of that rope we tie a rope to you I hold the end of that rope you go a little bit into the haze Pluto goes more into the haze we tug on the rope if something bad happens feels like a like an episode of something with portals where it's like I'll just do the portal and we'll tie a rope and everything well this is where I'm getting more comfortable wondering how high is the haze here that the haze hangs over the highest buildings yeah the haze usually rests anywhere from a hundred to 200 feet right over lol City Howard it's just like the movie the mist holy worse I'm worried that if something happens with it I just want to be able to get you out I appreciate I have a handkerchief and goggles I'll be fine I have the drift globe what have you pass out oh yeah then have a seizures that's why we need a rope will feel the seizures in the rope it's bullet yeah okay so how can we test it we could also just walk around in the heavy haze for a bit and then one of us take the thing and see how better we feel well then at least all three of us are in it my plan was always to stay outside but yeah I know and I'm trying to dredge Oh question could I how long did you set an hour like I think an hour is a good a good like I have a rope trick and I'm wondering if I go at least to like the edge of the heavy haze and I can watch you from there and you you be further if that would work you have rope trick yeah I'm just trying to know I'm trying to think of this in characters it like in character um what does the rope trick do it allows me to touch a length of rope that was six feet long on the end of the rope rise to the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground in a visual entrance opens and I can essentially go into like a little dimension okay I have a stupid plan can you not start with that we're gonna stop Pluto in the heart we're gonna run into the deep haze you're gonna rope trick you and me are gonna climb off and we're just gonna chill there and keep eyes on our test subject for loads we can pull you up we can pull you into any of you guys just standing like sitting in a pocket region about me yeah we keep eyes on you were in a pocket dimension there's no haze I'm in cool we have to make a mad dash aw like hold my breath and we'll run as far into the day I have a rope trick me nature I'm gonna have to find it now so we have all this point Weiss - I can do this twice okay so we bulletproof completely unbreakable nothing can go wrong I feel like we've prepared for everything yep can I cast spells from inside the Rope trick dimension like out of it you can't attacks no spells can't cross to the entrance in or out of that shirt but I can stick I can stick my hand out sold so we're gonna go find some really cloudy hazy haze jump in and rope trick out and you're gonna kind of create an observation deck I'm gonna do a lot of like Cal aesthetics like I'll be like I'll do jokes I'd like they'll be all like the sensors hooked up to me I'll be like running on this one like I'm good proper medical test of the A's sounds great okay I can also what I can do is I can feel I need Jill idiot forward and and get it set up I don't see if I can find my ropes so that way you can all have it all ready to go but it'll have to be quick like once I have it all yell do it go because we don't have an hour yeah I got if I need to do it twice I can but like I don't want to waste it one amazing thing is that Monty has a mini for pretty much everything that you can conceivably think of so finding the Rope trick mini is now essential yeah it might not happen I guess the I want to do it I want to I want to stab myself do you want to send a shot in the Rope trick or do you want to do it and then we do the rope trick you can you yeah I guess so okay I'll feel better about it oh you don't you don't trust me I totally found my there you go lovely okay so we're all gonna run in to the haze we find a deep spot you guys rope trick up or I'm gonna stab myself in the heart and with with the the mystery potion and then we're gonna just hang out for an hour okay so is there any sort of spot that you're gonna look for you're just gonna run and end up like wherever as deep as you end up after like a couple minutes of running it run towards the tower okay but we just want to get far enough that like basically as long as I can hold my breath for the Hayes kind of Falls right it does it settle more or less it's a it's a it's a Miss in a thick fog so if you've ever been in that pea soup style fog that's what it's like right now although there are flickers of purplish matter and particles that hang in the air I love pea soup I'm also thinking you said there's a second piece of the meteor that broke off here correct yes let's run towards that as much as possible let's go we want to go to there yeah okay it's like until we start to feel the effects really badly and then I can just rope trick it up and get out of there and then and we when we say run like a light jog okay not exhausting like not much but you're not walking it's not a Sunday stroll shall we be worried about enemies in this yes we'll find out hopefully you don't come across anything we're not gonna be stealthy that's for sure okay clunk clunk clunk clunk so you are Stan standing along the intersections of Dwemer street and College Street the last area before the deep haze really begins to sink in and Pluto so are you gonna armor back up after you imbibe this stuff is the CI yeah okay so how long would it take for me to like get to to move my breastplate around what am I wearing you're wearing splint so just - I just wanted a nice clean shot at the old the old could I tie it to a arrow and then shoot you I feel like the accuracy is better if he just stabs himself yeah as much as you want to shoot Pluto in the heart please don't use a sharpshooter so it is it is heavy armor taking taking the armor off entirely it takes five minutes and putting it back on again takes ten so I'll say that to take off the armor because you you do it is like a coat underneath and everything like that upper part portion of it is a big bit they say it's gonna take ten minutes to take the armor off administer it and put it back on it's not fair yep okay okay so are you gonna lay down when he gives you this you can stand up I'm gonna do it to myself okay alrighty so brave so so brave yeah and actually if you if you help taking the if you have help putting the armor on or off if these to help you it will go faster as well can we do all help dress and undress you okay if you guys both help and then just right and then run up into the thing as soon as my armors back on you want to take it off before we start running or do your alright Pluto ready for your juice cleanse you take your armor off for science Oh Jay alrighty and I press it into your flesh yeah press the plunger down as you press it into your body it's boiling warm as it goes into your body you can feel it inside you it's hot and almost immediately you can feel your body temperature rising it's like a fire has been set in your heart it's like when I'm dancing more like extreme heartburn Oh like when you dancing I only dance with imodium precedent currently have resistance to radiant damage now that you've imbibed this and I'm gonna secretly roll to find out how long this is gonna last before the further really bad effects kick in hopefully it's more than an hour oh I think it will be so take it what do you do with the leftover syringe I'm gonna pocket it pocket it and these two and I emptied it right like there's no drippings left it's like it all in me it's all in oh yeah don't put your hand in the can already see see as as Vale and Sebastian as you start putting me putting the armor back on him you can already see him perspiring and this what you can see there's very clear beads of glowing sweat dripping down his brow and when you put your helmet back on and close it there's actually a little orange glow coming out from your visor of the sweat like there's a beard what's wrong why are you looking at me like that that's working like Oscar said it would everything is checking out so far are we going up your Roach a deer yeah and we start to climb up already cat so wait didn't you want to run further in before you did this oh I really thought I was maybe I had the order wrong I think you're gonna put in by running okay alrighty so you all-out sprint in you find yourselves in as you as you race forward you find yourself in an area of low ruined buildings and homes some old shops and you can smell in the air it's like this acrid smell of what was probably several all chemical shops and storage areas as you're heading deeper into the end of the area and already Sebastian you can feel the impact of the the D pays despite your protections so I'm gonna get both you and veo to make constitution saving throws with advantage because again veo even though you're resistant you're not immune to the effects of the D pays Ludo nothing you feel fine I feel great my cardio is at an all-time high 18 it's a con save yep I got a 10 a 10 you're all right for now okay all righty you stopped in the street and you can start to see through the fog you can see that purple glow of delirium not far in the distance you're pretty close to the crater but you are definitely in the deep haze do you want to go deeper or do you want to stay here and go for it I say we go for it I'll do the full experiment do you mean like move closer mm-hm okay okay let's do a quick I feel great quick sprint what kind of a researcher would I be if I wasn't checking out this crater here okay you rush forward and you come to a small square an intersection with several more shops buildings in the midst of several alleys and as you come closer you can smell this rank all chemical odor has been increasing in smell as you get closer shot through with that familiar ozone like smell of delirium and as you come forward you come into a small into a square where there is a completely shattered and blown out building not dissimilar in size to the rat's nest Tavern however you can see that the building has been blown out and in its place is a seeping mass of glowing liquid because the whatever impact happened here it seems to hit an alchemist shop and it is created the crater itself has been filled in with this bubbling soup of all chemical ingredients that is glowing purple with with delirium it almost looks like that whatever this meteor was made of what the alchemical ingredients melted it into delirium soup and it is glowing and bubbling and as you come close to it Vale and Sebastian you can feel the radiation of the of the haze and the delirium burning off of both of you and I need you both to make Constitution saving throws but neither of you gain advantage on the saving throw 22 Sebastian 23 okay you are both fine for now the effect is persistent and I will need to make a saving throw every minute you remain in this area let's get out of here right before since since I've just made this safe can I take the empty vial from the potion that I drank a couple games ago do I have tongs like with my thieves tools do I have anything that I could like scoop it without touching it yeah oh yeah I also have a mage hand I quickly made hand the vial and scoop up some of it and cork okay the mage hand takes the vial puts it down into the liquid and the vial melts alright time to go into your occult science performed you know what we we may not be able to get it now but I'm wondering if your dad can build us some things over them the movie era iron like a container yeah cool sweets alright let's let's get up this rope trick rope trick up Pluto you stay down there and do some jumping jacks yeah I begin what is going to be a seventeen part study in haze resistance yeah I'm keeping a journal poke your finger in that in that goop other thing that melted the vial because it melted the vial doesn't mean will melt flesh you are I don't know I have my reservations okay they will do this we have three vials that we're gonna be able to try this out on which toad you need the leaves the little one yeah just dip your little toe in okay what if I did this then what if I did this don't you don't tell me there's a troll that took it off I'm wearing I'm wearing the boots the spiked boots that we took from the gnomes hmm I want to take Sebastian's dad dad's boot - boot and I wanna I want to try - I want to go to the edge of the pool and try to like dip it in okay so you you're gonna cut walk to the edge of this pooling crater and dip the boot into the liquid okay remember that scene from Who Framed Roger Rabbit I mean you're wearing the boots okay so you're gonna dip the boot in into the liquid as vo and Sebastian are in a little coordinating the road watching observing taking notes okay so have a cast time or is it just one round one action it's one action okay great so the two of you create the rope trick and you zoo right up so pollute oh you're gonna go right to the edge of this whole thing approach it slowly okay does it burn as you approach it you can see that there's like a weird reflection of your face in the surface of the liquid and then it looks really strange make a perception check twelve you look at this reflection this twisted reflection in the surface of this alchemical soup and all of a sudden the eyeball of your reflection starts to almost raise up out of the soup and it's getting larger and larger and you realize it's an eye it's a real eye floating in it and it increases in size and then it pops and spraying a small amount of acid all of this this alchemical soup all over all over the place and you can see that the bubbling of this soup they're bubbling eyeballs that instead of bubbling up it's just an eye that comes up expands in size pops and then pull those back into the end of the liquid noted that was probably some people in there yeah it must have been full of people and now the people oh man alchemical soup is people yes it's al al and chemical chemical probably like you can feel the heat of this this area you're sweating profusely underneath but you don't feel sick good good yeah I want to dip the boot roll 86 for you go into dip the boot you lower the boot down and this strange wave sort of forms and the postulating iCore below and it kind of rises up from two other sides to almost like a mouth and as you lower the boot down the mouth begins to close and shut around the boot what are you gonna do I let go of the boat and as you drop the boot this mouth comes up from the iCore and just chomps the boot and as you do you can hear this this strange it's almost like the bubbling of the liquid you can almost hear a voice on it that says something that sounds like the soup has claimed one boot okay Pluto do you want to try do I hear them yeah yeah you can hear them you want to try to put like a humble claw in there yeah I'm gonna spend the next hour okay no no as you continue to throw things in in the soup this strange another wave begins to rise up out of it and as it rises up this collection of bubbling eyeballs and frothing mouths coalesce before you they have the strange the coalesce from the liquid in this purpley red almost like burned and charred flesh rising up out of this alchemical Sloot soup and as it does so the ground at the edge of the crater begins to almost turn to mud and slick you guys can roll for initiative I was going to feed it elder to Lily's next know where's our where's our that's our observation deck you're gonna watch me get even by Zoop we'll be back in Drakon Himes soup eats you okay that was the booty so these strange masses of writhing alchemical soup and flesh with biting MA like mouths and eyeballs that bubble up slowly increase in size some getting as large as a small basketball before exploding in a shower of pus and all chemical eye course what do we got for initiative nine a nine fourteen I also have a nine okay okay I'll go before soup I am one with the soup you will be I am I have made contact with the soup people journal entry day 43 in Dragon hime if you haven't figured out already these are none other than giving mothers yay what are those piles of milk and they beat you on initiative okay so the get ring now there's Cola less out of the acidic school and we can bring up our battle can there as well hurry yeah probably have to adjust the shot just a little bit nice as they coalesce and form you can hear them speaking and almost screaming with their mouths saying things like it should give more give more give more e TG g th and also sometimes screaming words of why no no more as these mouths continue to stand most of all just get rich they just continue to say one of the first ones rises up out of the pool of the crater moves towards you uh and it moves very slowly towards you pollute oh and as it does it begins uh it actually fires the spittle that comes out of one of the eyes as it explodes and i need you to make a dexterity saving throw whoo but BAM is it directed only at me it is indeed 12:12 you raise your shield and the spittle soars it hits just the top of the spittle and it goes right past it and directly into your visor and into your eye you are blinded Oh and as the creature comes up getting a big old 15 to hit negatory mr. jibbery eyes alrighty no it's the second one lurches forward ah also biting you perfuse Lee getting a mighty 11 on its attack rolls I'm just flailing around wildly cuz I have spittle in my eye and I'm dodging first up Sebastian you're up seeing this happening I hop my well no I actually I'm just gonna poke my arm out of the portal okay and kind of like look down and be like Bluto duck and I cast scorching ray and I fire beams of fiery Alliance as you pop out you can hear the babbling of these creatures give me a wisdom saving throw no 5/5 already rolling d8 here we go seven seven okay as you come out you hear the the the babbling creatures and you scream and terror as it as it echoes into your mind and you fling away and you need to make a melee attack against Aveo so I pop my head out they I hear the sounds of their making and I'm instead of yelling duck I turn to Vail and slap you you can try I get a twelve it doesn't leave out of the way as you do so unfortunately that's your turn there Sebastian I don't want to deal with this right now and I walk off into your portal dimension okay Vail you're up all right I am I just want to like almost like rest my edge of my feet on the edge of the portal and kind of like swing down upside down okay pointing my long low at the one that's in front of Pluto okay make an acrobatics check to keep yourself in place 26 okay so you swing down out of it so you're hanging upside down outside and you hear the give ring of the mother make a wisdom saving throw nobody saw that it was blinded and I'm 22 all righty that's at the crit yeah okay you are good to go what'll it be all right I'm going to take my thirty shots using my extra attack and my dread ambusher oh man and I'm gonna shoot it the one in front of pseudo it's my first attack 12 that will actually hit hitting these things like a broadside of a barn door BAM 22 damaged my second attack same one I hit it 18 plus 5 for 18 damage and there's bloodied who and the my last attack same one 19 plus 5 wow that's some sharp shooting right there upside down upside down and that's 21 damage ok as you flip back upside down outside of the outside of the rope trick you fire three swift shots into the get ring now there's your arrows piercing the eyes and mouths with loud pops a rupturing bits of its of it whatever the internal kind of anatomy of this thing is sending bits of alchemical fluid spilling all over the floors and into the area it's extraordinarily wounded if it has a concept of being and therefore bloodied but it is still alive and then I swoop back up into my rib trick a pollute oh I think I skipped you each your turn you Everlong just say there goes before me yeah I'm you know being blinded is not my for it wasn't ideal you know and yeah this is the size this experiments going and the ground beneath you is the alchemical fluid spills around your feet are sinking into the ground make us strength save me throw 23 okay you're fine but I do need that wisdom savings with you oh goodness things are just so nasty 20 okay you're good though you sink into the ground you are blinded and you are hearing these horrible whispering giving give riches you keep your resolve and you keep your strength but you are blinded I'm going to disengage okay and I'm going to back up all righty me there's stuff we go to the I'm just gonna back up and after I disengage I'm kind of like wildly swinging and using my shield cuz can I actually would it take an action to start to try to clear my eyes the blindness will end at the end of the mouth who's next turn okay anyways yes how far away would you like to move from about I'm gonna try to go my full move until they hit like a wall the ground around the matters is difficult terrain so it's half speed there so you'll be able to move about 20 feet away from them put me up like yeah right to this just keep way to the street yeah I'm just gonna keep backing up cool but with my body to them okay kind of like yeah yeah alrighty the mathers for science the mathers lurched forward towards you they spend both their movement and their actions to get right up to you again they come in for me yep they are I sense them and the blindness is over yeah they lurch forward leaving this trail of I Corps and grit behind them the ground stained like the passage of acid sweeping across it Sebastian you're up I come back to the hole and look down I'm like okay sorry about that got a little freaked out there these things are weird let's try this again and I'm gonna I'm gonna okay pop out give me that wisdom saying throw buddy gibbering 12 you're good yeah all right so I'm gonna cast scorching ray I'm actually going to quicken it okay where would you like to direct the first ray at the injured bloodied one okay go for it with all the arrows did it eat the arrows they ruptured parts of it and the arrows have since been absorbed by it yeah she got 25 give me damage yeah 9 damage that destroys it boom burned away leaving behind almost like an acid you acid-washed slick on the city streets I'm gonna direct the next ray at the other okay that's a crit nice thanks for nice so I aim right between its I most wherever the most eyes concentrated and concentrated amount lies I hit it right in the middle of all of them nice I roll I roll it twice right eighteen damaged it collides with the eyes making them all explode in a shower of gold and all fluid that ignites in the air like lighter fluid I got one more ray right yep sixteen and hits ya right there easy you get you good eight more damage bloody ten and I actually can't remember what these guys have but I'm just gonna I'm gonna throw it a chill touch on it as well okay twelve that hits very nice so finally after blasting it with these beams of energy a ghostly hand grabs it by the face where is its face yeah I don't know what will count once again wherever whatever whatever looks the most face like I'm grabbing that and doing for more Anna chronic damage to [Music] ten more sorry thank you forgot that second died right yeah no rolled an eight that's not a die to forget okay with that Sebastian the creature relentlessly continues to bear down upon Pluto but veo it is your action soon my body down and say okay where we at it's just kind of taking the scene and I take my two shots using my lungs oh cool roll it and give me the wisdom saving throw first cuz this creature continues to give her words of madness five that is a failure I needed you to roll me @ d8 please - alrighty the voices echo inside your mind and you can feel this buzzing migraine and you pull yourself back you cannot do anything let's turn what's wrong Vale we said in slap someone I'm like you go on without me I've done my part but you got oh six Romeo d 8 sir another six ok so here's actually what we need to find out so at the start of your turn the creature begins to give her even louder and veo hold your head baggage he and she tries to like hold herself in place and you yourself succumb to the same thing you rolled a six you however are going to be running in a random direction however I need you to make a strength saving throw first to see if you're stuck in the gearing mouth or difficult terrain he's be stuck please be stuck Oh eleven you are not stuck no so Romi ad8 and actually certain and the d8 will go one two three four five six seven or yeah yeah that's correct yeah yeah so that'll be the different cardinal press so just anything but one five five okay so you basically run away from the creature at five o'clock which is that way at your foot at your full speed and you provoke an attack of opportunity and it gets a twenty two hit oh yeah that's the money as you run away from it it lurches out with a blinding array of bytes biting you in the ankles and in the back and you take a total of seventeen piercing damage and I need you to make one more strength saving throw of o hawai being knocked prone Oh 21 okay you don't you you rush away Wow it bit me it bit me in the ankle I'm still taking notes hmm and then the mouth are rushes back towards you and goes to bite you again getting a mighty five to hit and that's when I'm going to I'm gonna repost you actually cannot take reactions because you've been affected by it is it cuz he's jabbering yeah cause if it's jibber jabber jibber jabbering jabbering so we go to the top with Sebastian so screaming science-y everybody screaming you're holding your head in pain pluto's yelling science and screaming and running out a wall and the creatures just like you you run up against the wall and it just like sloshes right up against you like this fleshy wave try to bite into your armor it can't find purchase anywhere your armor but it's almost like engulfing you almost like it's a gelatinous cube but it's not yeah and it's giving like vayo visions wisdom save yep I make it nice I rolled a nineteen so I I pop out and I point at the gibbering mouth er or giving and I say hey mouth er eat this and I fire a fireball probably wants to 17 yeah it's but BAM seven damaged it definitely ate it it opens its mouth wide up and and swallows the the fire bolt as it comes in and there's like a pop as parts of it fly away but it's still there's enough of it together to continue fighting I pop back up and I grab you and I'm like you need to snap out of it because I thought I was going to kill it and I think Pluto needs help nein that is a failure roll me a d8 don't shoot me with an arrow you run in a random direction so roll me a [Music] d-10 because on a 9 or a 10 you're gonna wait you're still hanging upside down so roll a d6 and there's a 50-50 shot that you're just gonna jump right down to yeah you do let go and you're gonna fall the 20 feet that you guys were up you take 8 points of damage you land prone and you're there on the ground I said snap out of it and you instantly just fall you pop your head out and just fall on you did not you're just like have you ever seen like a cat just totally miscalculated jump yes this is just what happened it's the gibbering okay pollute oh let's get that wind these guide those dice 21 all right you're good I'm gonna spin around and just start wildly slashing at this monster cool whatever it is just just feeding it 14 that's a hit for 10 damage and then and I'm screaming the whole time just just yelling 23 for 13 damage and you cut it into large slice that bubble out and spill with this alchemical fluid all over the ground and cease moving and I keep backing into it holding my head and my eyes vayo and Sebastian I'm both gonna have you make one more Constitution saving throw because you've been exposed again because you came outside of the came outside of the Rope trick you came out each time you popped it to attack 21:27 okay you're good they'll give me one more as you climb back into the Rope trick I'm guessing you're gonna do that - yeah cool crit you guys are really resistant to that maybe you don't need this syringes what no thank you skulls we didn't need any all the crits - yeah yeah thank you before we delve into the ruins I have a few people that I want to

it was for science it was truly the noblest cause humankind has ever aspired to and the best reason to adventure yeah and I will not be subject 51 that dies as part of a Oscars journal I will survive and I will overcome survive and thrive yeah yeah so as you're kind of like washing like you're just scraping off the grit of this giving mother all these bites you can kind of see just vales tail just disappear into the invisible window of the road trip back to observation because like you can't like what you're seeing is this rope that's risen into the air and it just ends suddenly it's it and lets the two of you have pulled it up or you're leaving it down and it just ends and when you when they walk up they just disappear so you can't even see them watch thank you like for all you know they could be like eating a hamburger yeah there's nothing attention yeah just down there listening to this bubbling pool and totally like sitting by the the hole eating a sandwich and watching it I'm definitely eating snacks like you guys aren't eating up there right you're watching observing diligently I'm gonna continue my my own personal journal [Laughter] yeah I'm gonna do like jumping jacks and I'm gonna practice like cartwheels see some burpees yeah burpees like a lot of like yeah I'm and I feel great and I'm just I'm just hanging out sweet it do i I feel great uh you feel pretty good you've got a little like again the feeling when this is in your system is not unlike a fever so you are sweating much more than you would be you feel a little bit of that heartburn it's not enough that it's impairing your ability to move or act or even fight it's uncomfortable to say the bat to say the best of it but given what has happened before when you've been exposed to the haze like this and like the fact that you're right in front of this pool of irradiated delirium infested alchemical soup and not dying of exposure to it in less than a minute probably says a lot about the effectiveness of this concoction I'm gonna do some browsing around then in the ruins okay I want to look for some delirium yeah if you spend the next hour kind of searching around you can see that there's small clusters of delirium that have formed along the edge of the crater it kind of almost like water lilies or Reed's piercing up from the edges or collecting on the banks as they're being washed from this frothy mixture in the middle the the crater is almost like a big cauldron and the delirium bits that are collecting on the edges of it almost like rust I'm going to snatch it how with my other boot okay it takes you a few tries to figure out a way to like break the Delirium off from the ground that it's connected use part of my Mason's tools mm-hmm Mason jewels and collected in the boot yeah ChIP chip chip you lose a few pieces into the soup but you are able to collect one boot full three pieces of delirium okay do I do I can I see him at this point on the edge yeah like tie the boot to the rope and I'll pull it up and I'll put it with our stash okay good idea try touching it science for science I'm gonna take my glove off mm-hmm I'm gonna pick up one of the Delian pieces underneath the rope I'm standing underneath the rope okay does that mean and I'm gonna touch the Delirium okay you reach down to touch and I touch it like a hot element like you know that yeah where you would like you you kind of tease it and I get close to it and then I eventually it feels almost like a hot element when you touch it hmm it's hot I see my fingers and almost like it's soft to touch it with your way here like you feel it almost give way to your flesh when you handle it is Dallaire it's delirium soft I yell it that we don't know well I'm gonna has it been kind of mushy or charred like it's been pretty shard like to put in putting a sock out I'm gonna kind of talk out my my observation so it's like I'm picking up the Delirium oh it's hot it's hot spicy hot spicy um I feel soft soft soft when you touch it after a few touches you realize it's not that the Delirium is soft when you're touching it oh it's almost like your flesh sinks into it just a little bit or it sinks into your flesh it's kind of hard to say I want to touch it I want to just put a small piece in the middle of my palm experiment over okay you've got one of these shards so it's it's not quite a small piece but if you want to break off a small chunk of one of them to try this with can I'm getting I I can't see you guys I'm just like doing this okay how far does it can I hold on to one end and kind of push it and with it with a gloved glove yeah yeah okay okay so you do this and as you push it towards your hand have you ever pushed a hot knife into butter yeah that it as you push the Delirium towards your flesh it the tip of it just starts to sink into your flesh almost right away I pull it out you pull it out and the flesh where you place it towards is like melted so you have now like a little melted spot of flesh and and if you kind of like poke that spot there's a moment where it's almost like fluid like and like dough before it settles back into into flesh and I was like this Nobby scar in the middle of your hike a five year old that just got stuff all over his hand I just like hold up my hand to the tip thank you it's doing this hurt did it hurt yeah did it hurt turns flesh into dough send up the Delirium I want to see if it does the same thing with me I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna send up the boot yep Das Boot I pull it up and I take the same piece out that you were using is it any different in my hands or does it feel the same no I feel it feels like a normal piece of delirium to you hmm we're so good at sizing no I just say we're noted with a decent amount of delirium right now that's why we need to go to amberwood village with all this information dude do we I think we have what we needed any other experiment do you see anything else in the rubble oh [Music] can you do a front-flip what what else do we need to know we need to know so I can I can touch delirium I can survive into your hand I wouldn't say you can touch delirium ease does it sink into your hand I don't care to find out I am Sebastian science I'm doing science gluto is my guinea pig I'm quite content with the information we have we know that the serum works we know that there's a pool of body parts melting together here so that's that's fun if you have to form something they try to see if we can get something else out of this pot I'll have to come back with two more vials I mean yeah we can always come back it's a nice place rivers for ourselves yeah sweet all right you guys want to head to back out of the town and yeah we got a run though yeah we'll have to run yep you're pretty good huh you probably don't have to run Ludo can you carry me I think you were probably running faster than he can carry you yeah but then I have to breathe a lot okay fine can I pull the whole can I scrap that would be a cool variant on rope trick so then there's got to be something else though that what are we we just came here to experiment with your body I'm just thinking is there anything else in ruins that we could find since they're all all the alchemical shops that might have some well then Pluto should go investigate that well I eat more sandwiches yeah I'm gonna I want to spend some time going around this area sure you just want to want to search around how much time do you want to like is how long have we spent so far and we you you spent about half your time so if you want to spend the remaining half hour searching around for the nearby buildings yeah you yeah let's uh let's roll one of these d100 okay it's kind of big you head into one of the shops in this area the first one that you pass by it looks like it was filled with a bunch of books and scrolls and stuff like that look like my paper maker shop you open up another another door and it smells roughly all chemical filled with a lot of vials few other things the the few but as you come closer to the vials they're filled with ink the the shops in this area all seem to be like supply stores for like the things that Wizards would have needed so book bookmaking book binding ink makers there you pass by a cobbler shop and a really is exquisite haberdashery with really tall pointed hats not my style however sifting around with in many of these places are the shocked and charred bodies of their occupants like many of the buildings here probably have not been explored at all before given their proximity to an impact crater of this magnitude and what what has happened here and you are able to kind of search search around if you pardon me and searching around through several of the areas you're able to find one of the the stores which seems to have a collection of some potions inside it seems to be a potion maker shop oh I'm reading and well most of it is all chemical supplies and things there is a small locked box underneath the desk that you kind of break it open and inside are six vials they appear to be potions of greater healing whoo jackpot to each I also want to so I'm gonna grab the box but then also I want to start to just pull into a bag like the supplies sure so like a Bunsen burner like different vials and different like those swirly toriel like swirly Ronix and all day that looks so cool that I've done most of any of them break as you throw them into the bay but the broken glass inside will cushion the others yeah oh they're glass yes so you're able to assemble a few of those pieces of equipment like the ice and with that the Rope trick ends and Sebastian and Jo are deposited outside in front of the the alchemical soup lake crater you can give me Constitution saving throws right away nineteen six there you gave getting one level of exhaustion run and we - ten points of radiant damage you guys I'll start running cool as you flee the area of the heavy haze as quickly as you possibly can covering your faces running through it the the effects sink in really really quickly probably had you stayed in this area you would have experienced the effects like that every round you were there so that's just how much of an impact yeah I like every round you were outside you would have would have been digging the the save you're able to run fast at value you're able to run how fast in one round how fast okay I'm gonna have you giving you one more Constitution saving throw and sebastian give me two more as you rush out of the area of the de Pays hmm eight eight nine you both gain another level of exhaustion yeah I think that one reduces your speed by half their VAD is it or is that the one that's just disadvantaged on attack roles and I have to do one more 11 you're good Oh speed half and disadvantage on ability Jets okay yep tired cat yep even even the D pays affects you and like you're feeling sick now yeah yeah you're feeling the effects of the delirium second that's pretty acutely our weak weed closest to the tower though right like your Tower mm-hmm we are pretty close do you want to head there and take a rest and then what head back through Sheppard's gate and then go down to Ward's Everwood Village do you think that's gonna be the best cuz I'm actually closer to Sheppard's gate but I'm gonna need a rest at some point cos I mean if we're just heading straight to amberwood village and we don't stop along the way to do anything there's gonna be a moment when everything comes out of me and I want to be in a nice place for that to get to ember with village timelines be tired if you go through the route that you've taken before yep probably about four hours or so if you and that's going through the city proper if you take long if you go outside if you skirt around the city yeah it'll take about twice as long eight hours you can survive that can I hold it in for eight hours absolutely not I have no idea I think we need to get you did the tower then is there like is there a washroom I'm sure we figured out there's buckets there's a sewer system so there are washrooms and Dragons right not that kind of sewage system yeah for the early parts of human history the sewers were there to drain what was in the streets necessarily what was in people's homes although there would be parts of the underground system that would also deliver water bills would be distinct so you'd have to have a really really nice home and a really really nice setup to have working plumbing that would go in like people in the in the old town might have have plumbing proper in their homes but most houses would not they just throw stuff on so what you're saying is just a good chance that Pluto is just going to have to destroy a street corner like I gotta have a special delivery for the fish people that's what vessel delivery for the fish okay so your destination then is your tower yeah okay cool you can all roll me a d6 on your way back for three okay oh it takes much longer with Vale exhausted and suffering the effects of delirium sickness and an acute effect on Sebastian you take a very cautious route through through the city proceeding about twice as long about it takes you twice as long as it would normally take you as a result of this but you are able to make it back to the tower safely it takes you roughly three hours just to cross through the city and in the state that you're in and as you get back to the the tower Pluto it's it's happening man how does it how what do I feel first [Laughter] it's it's it's coming out the back of you man I'm sorry I just start making a high-pitched and I just run ahead of you guys and into like a corner of the does she get the armor off in time woo Miki dexterity check with disadvantage I try to pull your armor off I demand that they help me are you guys no help me no I'm not going near them right now he ran away going what do you got a check dexterity check yet five so you get about halfway through the process of getting your armor off I started at the top when it starts and yeah it like my we can hang it from from over here it's it's yeah yeah I and the smell is just a bucket I think it smells like death it like putrescence and then it starts coming out your mouth as well and it's it's just liquid yeah and your dad's not gonna like what I did to his armor we might need to like soak the hardware for a day or so so I'm just quietly no problem quietly I'm loud no it's very loud that's very painful I mean that I'm gonna be on the bottom layer of the tower while you guys are up stating don't do it in the tower it's too late man he ran in the tower he ran to a quarter and it's happening Pluto I need you to clean that corner we have to live here no I'll send zone so don't be feathers like absorb it lay down some newspaper yeah like when you when you see throw up but like the amusement park I think we just put use a bunch of harpy feathers to try to soak it up it's painful and it burns how long does it last there's so many maths going on how long how long four hours of varying intermittent periods of as I think I'm over oh yeah guys I feel really good nope yeah and and it kind of alternates between and then the vomiting starts - yeah and how does my overall body feel it might feel burped am I still feeling the fever am I still know you gained four levels of exhaustion yeah I'm so tired yeah I'm just laying in a heap of my own yeah buy it by the end of it it is and like it's not it's not fecal matter it's bile right like like it almost what comes out of him has the same consistency as what those all chemical creatures were made of so I have hit point maximum have disadvantage on all things speed half I'm pretty used to this well I'm a heap I'm a heap of a guinea pig I imagine that like by the time like it's four hours of him on the bottom floor and I imagine that we go upstairs when I hang out but then when we come back down he's like scrawny and like pale and withered it's out of me he's sitting in a pile of his own filth and then can we get you up you know tie the rope around you so we can pull you up and then we'll have a rest we painstakingly try to carry Pluto up to the bed are you gonna help him clean himself up no I won't be on my bed broken and just you don't even gonna help him walk I'll do okay wait is there a source of water nearby actually they're the closest would be the wells in the city and do you know yeah yeah that's sorry man wait oh let me a dry wipe like my cheaters I like I like pick up one of the dirty cloths that like one of the harpies was using and I hand it to you there you go man clean yourself up you stay in that corner you guys really looking out for me I really appreciate you smell terrible we have to get you to amber what where we can you feel terrible too it's wrong is there like a bathhouse in amber wood village or something like that a river what the rivers poisonous no oppai amber wood village not the one yet town have a nap can we take a rest but he gets no benefits does he yeah he does we do well I mean for the four hours he was doing his thing I think that we took a long rest you can make a constitution saving throw for each of the exhaustion levels low Pluto and see if you power through it can I power through it well the first one was a seven okay so no as I roll with disadvantage 19 okay I'm killing it eight and eight okay so through the sleep you do lose two levels of exhaustion in over the evening but the other two still remain it hurt yeah it did but you're not that I'm feeling no more she felt pretty good before but that's the key is that no well not you're not dead like coz what you were exposed to like Sebastian's you go over your notes the fact that he was able to be there for an hour he would have been dead otherwise and I got some potions out of him dead and how long pardon how long would he been dead you said a minute at best well perhaps yeah yeah yes really was like like had the two of you not been in the rope trick you wanted to find it yeah yeah and I feel much lighter much more spry there we go but that's a pretty I got a gun of it I did not imagine using rope trick to avoid the haze that's a really smart idea that that yeah good idea good idea we heading to amber wood mm-hmm now that we're all rested up and everybody's in tip-top shape do I still smell yeah yes I mean is it on par with again it's again you don't smell like who like it it smells like rotting flesh yeah you know like those stink beetles yeah Pluto you're gonna have to walk 10 feet behind us no no we're a team yes okay I guess the best way to describe it is and maybe never like thought of this smell before but like I've heard doctors exclaim that like the smell of a cancer of a pair of lungs that have had like lung cancer from a smoker that they that there's like a really bad smell to them and that's what they smell like that's what this smells like intense it's it's really intense and what and again what came out of you was more like liquid and bile then like it wasn't it wasn't anything that would have naturally come out of you yeah maybe then maybe it's good to do these once in a while you know to kind of help out with the old system how about this I won't necessarily walk by you but I figure out which way the wind is going and I walk not in the way that it's blowing towards me that's fair yeah the next day dude you set out the next day yeah okay so the time passes you set out the next day again slowly with pollute om tones slow - and in this case the the care that you have to take to account for the four polluters we can state along with the routes that you've now taken several times you've got a pretty good system going like at this stage you guys have traveled from Shepherds gate to the tower and back again like probably over a dozen times I think and so Vail you've basically managed to set up like with your knowledge of the city you've managed to set up a series of routes that you're very very adept at leading the group through this city so I'm not gonna check for random account encounters as long as you're going directly from the clock tower to Sheppard's gate with no intervening stopovers we won't check for random encounters anymore I think I want to do yeah and so once again you pass through Sheppard's gate and the the hooded lanterns ask what did you haul this time you have anything that you found potions gold treasure I hand them one piece of delirium that we found it was a pretty rough adventure this time and as you can tell Pluto got a little sick from the haze all right we got right in there they take the shard they not and allow you passage you make your way back out across the outskirts of the city tracing down through the sprawl and crossing the river with Styx's ferry yes and following the dran River down to Everwood village the journey I said it's only about five miles out from the city so it takes you the better part of the morning before you arrive once again lazily in amberwood village home - it's been a little while since you've been back here I think you've been almost in this city for now it feels like probably close to two weeks since the last time you were here in Everwood village and as you come into amber wood village in the middle of the afternoon there's a bit of activity or around people moving about their typical business of the day the taverns haven't really opened up and you can hear as you come into the village square the pounding of metal and the this plumes of smoke that are coming up from Crow and Sons smithy there's a few wagons that are that are moving about but everything seems pretty sleepy in this town what will you do where will you go first thank you your dad's house should we go to the Crone sons to see if he's fast oh you want breakfast breakfast he also River was supposed to deliver the iron to my father as well do you think he'd make his breakfast we can head you on breakfast we can head to my house and see a filmmaker yeah okay well head we'll head to my well not my house my dad's okay dad's place see your brothers and sisters yeah I have gifts for my my brother and sisters what did you get them this the harpy feathers one of them gets this devil masks and one them gets this heart be egg that is somehow still intact in my bags wait how long is like Oh even give me a warm yes okay don't give that to them as you head to where the crow house is the what was once a low thatched home that has been built out a little bit more I look around its own little farmstead and sell a little plot of land with a shadow at the back you can see the part in front of the house is a very large carriage it is a covered wagon that has been painted purple and brown and gold and it has very thick glass windows covering up the inside of it and a pair of lanterns hanging on either end and there has been a horse hitched to it there's a pair of white horses that have been hitched to it outside the front of that the house there's a door leading to it it's a large enough covered wagon that someone who could probably sleep inside of it so I can workshop style wagon and you can see that there's a little bit of activity around around the house you can hear some voices within you approach I I look through the windows and the carriage is there anybody inside you look through the windows and all you see is a hazy blackness are there any logos on the carriage anything that I might recognize no but the colors are oddly familiar amethyst mm-hmm needs or they said they deliver it yeah maybe it's my mentor huh she would go inside we home and get some eggs bacon sausage we homework right Alric Eldrick Eldrick a hard time with that one knew him for years can't remember his name okay go bang on the door yeah I mean I I live here too so whatever um yeah I go in the front door and you can hear that there's a bit of laughter within sounds like the laughter of a few adults and you hear Moira's always say oh just just a moment I'll get that and she opens the door she sees the three of you and says Sebastian Baio and hello you're back well welcome and she sees Pluto's like oh my god pollute oh gods come in come in by by the flame by the flame come in in and in and she hurries you into the house and the children rise up and they scream and and at seeing you Emma and Sybil are both here and they they squeal with delight and run up to hug both mayo and Sebastian and as they go to say hello to pollute oh they're like you you smell really bad no self conscious about it another plant into the home the main room of the home which is both the kitchen in the living room and everything because the two bedrooms are just built off to the side there's a large central table in front of the hearth and seated there drinking what must probably be tea so I was like are two familiar faces to use Sebastien and one familiar face and one very unfamiliar face for the other two of you the first is River she's sitting there setting down her her cup of tea wearing her typical regalia the amethyst Academy the light riding outfit with the the her hood has been slung back over her chair and she's she's got a stack of books in front of her and her her mug of tea that she's just finishing sipping and she she smiles warmly as you come in you can see her toothy grin with her teeth that are just like he's that little bit too sharp to them and her stare that just is just so impeccably weird that whole appearance of river as a tea fling beside her is a very large elderly black man he is he has a skullcap that he's wearing and Sebastien everyone figure out if he's bald underneath that or if he just has hair but he has a gray white beard that has been shaved in the shape of a square so the bottom is a straight line it's so cool and he has these big bushy eyebrows that are white and gray over over his face and this just completely pockmarked skin and he wears a pair of circular purple tinted reading glasses and he as he he stands up as you enter setting down his tea he's about six foot four so he's a huge man for a mage and as he stands up in River stands up and he says welcome good to see you again Sebastian excellent to see you too and Moira says I assume you all know each other and she says Pluto I'm gonna be back I'm gonna I'm gonna run some water for you we're gonna get you cleaned up you didn't do anything to help why does he smell as she roses Moira walks off see son I'm not his maid he can take care of him my maid died strong and if she runs off Maire turns to Emma and says Emma go fetch your father and Peter tell him that Sebastian's back and we're gonna have dinner early tonight and she Moira goes off to fix everything out for you as and as Eldrick and River say come sit down but Pluto you can you can stand where are you gonna be okay all these wizards and not one of them can make me smell fun anymore you guys you know can you just give me like a magic perfume like I don't like a pause for a moment and Rover says River turns to Moira and says Moira don't worry about it and she comes up to you and casts prestidigitation across you thank you and Moira kind of just looks looks up back at River and looks back at the situation says River you've been here for five days and haven't helped me once with the cleaning and have been having all my cooking and you could do all the cleaning with a wave of your hand and River just kind of shrugs and says well you just look so happy in your dumbass tissa T I river thank you for that thank you yes thank you for I never learned that one yeah I try to wait I smell awful River my dad's out right now Moira says yes he's up the shop he's been he's been working he's been very worried you've been gone for over a week there's been a lot of work to do I need to have some words alone with these two and my father when he gets back here Maura says sure that's fine that's fine can I get you anything in the meantime River kind of I had a whole plan in mind for what I was going to do and River kind of short-circuited that on me eggs bacon sausage of course of course so Moira Moira heads off and begins cooking as you confer with elder Ken River before the kids run off though I present them with gifts from our travels the harpy egg for Sybil Sybil takes the the egg and she says is this for breakfast no that's for you to take care of and not hatch it's a harpy egg and for the youngest one I give a necklace of harpy feathers and they're like this is so cool and the two of them rush off to the corner already spouting off and trying to decide what they're going to name their pet harpy this can only go well such a good brother your great stepbrother Moira kind of sized sheets isn't gonna hatch into a monster is it we hope not well if it does we know what they are we know what we took it hasn't been taken care of properly it's been a week of it sitting in my bag I don't I think it'll be fine if it does hatch just to have that as their first bout of you know intro to warrior ISM there you go they can kill a baby that's fine okay Eldrick pours some more tea for all of you and it says it's good to see you Sebastian it's been a while and River introduces veo and pollute oh she says Eldrick this is veo Sonia and pollute Oh Jackson these are the three that I have been doing well but they've had a few slip-ups along the way what would you expect from me but we did real good this time promises listen I did my job I showed them around and actually it's not this moment I put the notepad or like alright or not Oscar's notes on the table as well as can I see the elder Chili's put those on the table and the two remaining potions and I put my hand on top of them giving them both one of the potions well they're they're in a satchel okay together so are you gonna give them show them both or not I'll show them both can you just give them one there we need one we're going okay so both are both are out yeah we need one River smiles kind of a wicked fiendish grin she says good job I knew I could count on you guys thank you does it work we have tested it why do you think you smell so much it makes you smell like that I mean you have to tell us how does it you have to inject it straight into the heart it's pretty intense but then you're immune to the haze however after the effects wear off your body needs to get rid of all the toxins built up inside of you and it's not her tea did you explain kind of the as you begin to give you a report and summarize the events of the past 24 48 hours Eldridge just sits back he crosses his arms he lights his pipe and he listens very intently River is the one that asks all the questions as you recant how the how it works and what it does what do you tell how much do you tell them I don't tell them everything okay well what are you what are the three of units say I give them the facts about wirings about what it does mm-hmm we don't have to tell them where we went what we saw or any of that they do ask where did you test it that's outside of Queens Park I'm not telling you yep the thick haze around the maged around the mage tower we didn't get close enough to the mage tower but we were in that physical you were in the haze around the old tower yeah this is fantastic it made my hand bubble it made your hand bubble yeah when I touched delirium to it so it doesn't give any resistance to handling the delirium fascinating that's that's we've tested this before when humans handle delirium directly it seems to melt into the flesh that happened how long until my dad arrives here um you're you're talking for a little while and they're they're starting to get the story out of you I want to know it what what you're gonna start to tell them before yeah seems like it might be a little while before he comes back at the very least what else do we know these are the notes from Oscar back we do need yeah we need to give them back we also intend to keep one of these potions so Oscar urine is still alive yes he's he's working for us just like he uses the eldritch lilies to make yes which is why we've got new alder chilies a sample of the potion and his notes fantastic I'm not gonna hand them over right away the notes there's something that I want to ask you two about mainly eldritch or Eldrick okay we can discuss this but we need those notes I'll give you the notes if you tell me about my mother and as you say that your father comes in because I also have this and I hold up her journal and I need to know some things because it seems that secrets were kept from me I add Eldrick looks up at Tobias as he comes into the room he opens the Tobias kind of barges in just as you say I want to know about my mother and he hears you say that and Tobias kind as you turn around him you can see that with his big red beard and hair and his goggles he almost turns red himself at the mention of this and you say I want to know about my mother and he says Sebastian what do you what is this all about what's going on I've recently discovered notes from my mother in the old clock tower regarding the mages guild the amethyst Academy and the ongoing workings in the clock tower alluding to the idea that my mother was in fact part of the amethyst Academy which is something that was I was never informed of I always thought my powers were an accident a mistake that I was obliged that there was something wrong with me and yet Here I am holding a journal that's proof that I'm more like my mother than I thought and I want to know I want to know why I am the way that I am your father looks at you and says Sebastian I didn't know this you have to believe me I I didn't know and he looks at Eldrick and he's like he says Eldrick did you know and Eldrick on crosses his arms and he says Lenna --the Eventide was one of the greatest Archmage's of the past 100 years is that your mom what does that make me to be honest Abass tchen it makes you exactly what you are a sorcerer with wild and random powers that's the nature of the beast your mother was a good friend of mine but she was already older than me by the time I joined the guild I think your mother would have been probably about three maybe four hundred years old and this tobias she wanted out she was done and she retired to a simple life that was it shocked everybody she hung up her books everything left it all and she wanted privacy that's all I know when I took you in after everything that had happened and I came to visit Tobias and found out that the bias didn't know the best thing that I could figure out was that your mother had reasons for not wanting to tell you and I figured the best thing that I could do to honor her memory was to not tell you whatever her reasons were for keeping that from you for keeping that from your father they were her own she wanted to walk away from this life and she died when you were born so we'll never know why she died when I was born and I've spent my entire life trying to figure out what happened to me and what happened to this city and and that night that I was born people talked about it like it they talk about me like I could have had these answers a lot sooner and there's still more answers I need and I think the secrets to my powers and what has happened to me and what happened on that night I was born I need to know everything letteth was quiet she was humble she was intense and she was powerful and to be perfectly honest I have no idea why she gave everything up to come to this small town and start a family with a simple man no offense to you Tobias he elder it turns to say you're a good man but it's a little shocking that a woman like Atlanta ended up in a place like this and Tobias shrugs and says Sebastian I don't know if you're gonna find any answers I'm sorry my boy I really don't but there's only one place that I know of where you could find them where's that your mother built that house and everything she left is she had it's it's all still there I haven't I haven't set foot in that house since the day I was born and you probably didn't step in it because babies don't walk like that's even more my mother like unless you're one of those babies that walks around once you're born like if that's the case then cool cool but and that's where we'll end today this is like a baby deer you just come out you just start running around [Laughter] they take away from your moment I think I think you made the moment that's good comedy that that that's where we'll wrap it up for this evening it's so good to be back Happy
