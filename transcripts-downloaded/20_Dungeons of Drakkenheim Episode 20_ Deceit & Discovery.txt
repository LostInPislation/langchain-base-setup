it pans out indeed hot on purse in pursuit of Oscar urine the renegade wizard with whom they had left Lenore Vaughn Castle the former queen of Drakon hime who is now absconded with her and seemingly come into the fortress barracks of the hooded lanterns at Shepherds gate where Oscar and the Queen are within the fortress whether or not the hooded lanterns even know what is going on our heroes cannot say however after hopping over the walls of Drakon hein to get into the city they have now come round the back of this barracks where they are fragmented into three groups vayo having climbed up the latrine chute into one of the guard towers sebastian having lost all of his hair in a wild magic surge donning the disguise of cornelius mortimer bigsby a second HOH shion's inventor has managed to get in the front get in the gate and is now in the other pretty in the keep leaving pollute Oh Jackson alone in the ruins right in front of the gate where he has thrown a strange vial collected from the mirror dimension of length Eventide you now stand in the fortress barracks of the hooded lanterns at Shepherds gate it is a large keep that abuts Shepherds gate itself so the gatehouse to the city on the North Tower of the gatehouse there is a large key built onto that itself then coming out from the keep is an internal wall not quite as thick or as tall as the walls of the city proper which encircles a training yard of barracks a lodge and the stables that the hooded lanterns use there are three smaller watchtowers on this wall one of them connecting to the main city wall itself and then a set of gates leading into the training yard but then there's a smaller port gate as well just off Shepherds gate we have a cute little map that I whipped up that should be going up right over here yeah just so that everyone following along can get a little bit of idea of what our map looks like yeah I think over over over the heads so the this should give you a bit of an idea of what you're looking at as far as the layout of the keep right now Sebastian you are in that small northernmost tower on the key or sorry not the northernmost the westernmost because this this map oh the big one or the little map that I've given you west is the top edge of the map north is then the right edge of the map yep so the westernmost small tower that's part of the keep that's where the privy that Sebastian is in is where as veo is on the tower directly opposite it on the gate gate side so just to the eat the easternmost the south east tower you would call it the keeper of the wall of the walls themselves yep now the whole area all of the battlements and the towers the hooded lanterns have installed their own hoardings all along the outer edge so you can imagine this fortress that would have once been a decent fortification inside the city but then the hooded lanterns have taken all this time to add additional wooden fortifications overtop of everything that give the whole top edge of the battlements and the towers a little bit of a ramshackle appearance the hooded lanterns have set up several large crossbow emplacements and sort of pill boxes on top of all of the towers so that they can protect it from the inside whereas originally the barracks would have allowed them access and still does allow them access to control Sheppard's gate itself outside of the city walls proper to the west of Shepherds gate the hooded lanterns actually have a small wooden palisade that they built around the gate as well to give an extra layer of external defense to the whole thing and so Sebastian when you came in through the training yard on the north edge of the key are where the doorways the lead into the keep proper are located atop a set of stairs and in the training yard you saw Oscar urines wagon abandoned beside the stables there was no one pulling it or anything like that as you came in and so Sebastian you are inside the keep in one of the privies veio you are in one of the watch towers also in one of the previous but pollute oh you are hiding in one of the buildings overlooking the street between the gate the the side street that comes off Shepherds Way overlooking the gate where you've just thrown this vial of the black liquid that you harvested from the mirror yeah I found it house pollute are doing right now he's having a mild to severe panic attack pluto's even like he watched veo scurry off and I was really confident when you left I was like yeah this is a good idea and then the loneliness started to creep in and how it's like diet like what if they never come back what if I'm alone in the city with no one and I can't get out like I can I can I can dimension door away from my problems all I want but but I can never outrun that I left you here oh my gosh oh my heart's beating I also went to the bathroom just not I didn't find a place but I did find a way to go to the bathroom aye aye aye I'm watching the eye through the vial because I'm like I need to create a panic I feel like I do well in panic like if there's a place on fire or there's a bunch of things running around I do better in those situations I like to think on my feet okay yeah so I threw the vial and I'm watching I'm watching it like you watch as the vial shatters in the street and the liquid inside spills out across the cobblestones and in the low rain it begins to bubble and steam and before the gate there are a pair of hooded lanterns a tall broad-shouldered half-orc carrying a massive longbow and a smaller human man both of them wearing their helmets and the livery of the hooded lanterns and they see this they see the shot the glass shatter but they don't seem to see where it comes from and the man turns and says gorg and I take a look keep an eye out and gorg the half-orc turns to him and says be careful stead that looks strange did you see where it came from no did you pop back belt Sten the human man shoulders his crossbow and walks towards whether vile shattered seeing the steaming and bubbling liquid in front of him and he kneels down and he calls over the large Mastiff that he had beside him he says come boy sniff it out and the dog comes towards the black loot bubbling liquid and as it gets close it growls and then starts whining and runs back towards the gate Sten says blasted hound and he reaches down with a one-take seeing one of his arrows and he pokes the liquid and pulls some of it up onto the arrow and as he does so he looks at it pulls it close to his face to examine it and suddenly the liquid stretches out and splatters into his face and there is a hissing burning sound as Sten screams reaches with his other hand towards the liquid trying to pull it off of his face but the liquid is expanding and he bubbles over his hand in his beginning to burn the bubbling hissing steam rising off of it as it begins to envelop around his face and over his hands he drops the arrow and gorg the half our companions starts calling out to him and turns to see as Sten turns around to face him part of his face is dissolving away revealing his skull and the bones of his hand as this liquid is enveloping across his entire body inning to droop down across of his body and he starts staggering forward as the black liquid continues to expand across all of his form covering him over and he stumbles forward into the puddle in front of him getting the liquid on his knees and hands and continues to fall into it as this liquid expands and grows dissolve a slowly dissolving him and his screams just resound around the entire area I was carrying that in my pocket like just and I don't even know if the cork was on the whole way like the whole time she's running around geez I'm gonna I'm gonna pretend like I didn't see all that I did but I just to try to like push it out of my mind like nope nope I ain't gonna put the drift globe down on the ground in this room not gonna turn it on yet and I'm gonna run out the back door pretending like I didn't see it it's not illegal okay one clunk you run out the back door in what direction away from the because I'm gonna try to go to another building okay and my plan is that I'm gonna turn on the drift globe just the light as like another distraction if if I get you left the drift globe in the building that you were in yeah you need to be holding it to turn it on then I'm gonna carry it with me okay then I'm just gonna leave that room I'm gonna find a new vantage point okay as you move to another building through the back alleys you can hear the general commotion of the hooded lanterns calling out you can hear voices saying it stands something he's in trouble quickly get the medics get the medics and there's a horn Blair that goes out for distress as several other hooded lanterns begin running out towards Sten and as you come into the next building and look back out again you can see that now gorg is out there say don't touch him don't touch him it'll spread it'll spread and so there's a group of about half a dozen hooded lanterns standing at the front surveying the screaming and writhing form of Sten unsure of what to do as an alarm bell sounds inside the barracks proper with that go over to Vale I'm sorry it's dead Val you hear the screams of this general commotion of someone saying it's Stan it's dead and this is just shortly after the other hooded Lantern had knocked on the Privy door and you'd given the excuse that you had to he'd had the runs and you hear him say it sounds like there's trouble as soon as you're cleaned up you better get down to the training yard and you hear the the steps rushing down the stairs do I hear it with just the one guy or do I hear two just one okay um I unlock the door okay I peek out to see what I can see around it is the guard room as before this spiral stairs leading up and down with doors leading out onto the battlements the room is empty of anyone else though there are just a few playing cards on the table some mugs of liquid and a half-eaten loaf of bread I go to the table I take the look and say that'll be a good snack for later and I want to try to sneak up the stairs again back up the stairs back up the stairs okay you head back up the stairs to the very top of the tower of the south wall of the southeast watchtower as you head up the stairs giving a perception check twelve you can hear someone on the top of the battlements is ringing the alarm bell is there a door that leads it's a trap door I want to push up the trap door as slowly as I can just so I get a peek so what you can see here is the top of the watchtower is a roofed Battlement so there are the crenellations of the cut of the castle wall and then they built a conical roof on top of it which the hooded lanterns have reinforced and hanging in the middle is a large bell that one of the men is that one of the hooded lanterns is their ringing it and you can hear the ringing sounding out do I know the man do you know the soda lantern you're looking at his feet yep can't really see him okay I sneak back down and I start to make my way down the stairs mm-hmm and I keep going down again I'm kind of cautiously kind of watching around to see if there's anybody coming I'm gonna take it pretty slow okay it's a spiral staircase that heads down the tower so you're now at the guard room level how far down do you want to go I want to continue to go down again kind of slowly at least one kind of around okay the the way the tower is built the staircase goes to the very top and as the staircase goes up there are arrow slits facing the outside so as you go out you can kind of take and see a glance of what's happening out side through one of the arrow slits but the only actual rooms in the tower are the guard room level the storage room at the very bottom and then the bell tower at the very top everything else is just a staircase that is then joined by that has arrow slits to shoot out and like there's small kind of sharpshooter spots along the staircase but there's no actual rooms okay so how far down is it to the storage room like how many flights of stairs there's no flights of stairs because it continued a spiral staircase it basically goes 20 it goes 30 feet up to the guardroom level and then another 20 feet up to the watchtower level okay I'll take yeah the whole tower itself is 60 feet high I take the 30 feet down and I want to sneak into the storage room again just to not I get in the door it's a small storage room with several barrels of provisions weapons ammunition and a singular door leading out into the training yard okay and that's how the this tower is accessed I go over to the door with the training room or the the training area is there any holes in the doors that I can see or don't have to open the door to see no it's it's an Ironbound strong door from your recollections of the way these doors are the doors themselves are at the top of a 10-foot high staircase so they're not quite on the ground level so the door opens up and you can overlook the entire training yard when the door opens up is there anything in the room that's like uniforms make an investigation check 14 yes there is a suit of leather armor and an extra hooded Lanterns cloak and standard weaponry there's enough gear here that you could put on a complete outfit as a hooded Lantern I do so I put it on and I take a like a crossbow or they have long bows and crossbows and they have a very standardized set of weaponry so they have short swords that they carry they carry Spears short swords crossbows long bows and there they have their own Quivers of arrows and stud leather armor if you want to change over it'll take you probably about 2 or 3 minutes to put on me the armor and I'll change over okay get myself in my own disguise it's not really much but I also want to like if there's something that I can put over like my face then I prize with it if it's their names the hooded lanterns do have hoods that they draw they can draw they also they also do have they also do have helmets that they wear their kind of a coiffed helmet or a standard standard helmet that you could put on that would hide your ears for instance cover my ears and somewhat cover my face with like a scarf of some sort I already have a scarf so I could partly put it on okay make a mask it of a human thank me oh is that no too much too much all right okay I then want to open the door slightly to kick and survey what's going on in the yard okay in the training yard there is a general commotion of another half dozen hooded lanterns that it seems like there were probably about a dozen hooded lanterns engaged in training exercises at this in this moment but they've all stopped to respond to what's just happened and there's a few people that are running towards the keep a few people running towards the gate houses and you can see now quite clearly looking out from the training yard that there is Lee that there's at least one hooded Lantern at the top of all of the watchtowers looking out in some cases there's two and there's at least one or two hooded lanterns on all the walls and all of them are now on high alert okay um I want to kind of camp here for a moment as long as I can until I guess somebody comes down from the guard tower to see if I see Cornelius running around in all this ruckus okay with that we move over to Sebastian aka Cornelius you two in a privy as you hear the shouting coming out from the the yard of this something's going on you can hear all the Bell bells ringing and you can and you hear shouts from within saying quickly notify the commander something strange has happened at the front is there a window in this room at all in the previous there are no windows in the previous what bathroom have you been big window like Sebastian just kind of is pacing back and forth does he hear the guard who was watching over him in in this in the Privy did they leave or are they still do I hear like them walk away or are they still standing guard make a perception check three you have no idea you can hear shouting in the movement of soldiers and an armor from within but whether or not someone is still waiting it's either you're privy you have we can't be certain I take out my handy mirror is there like enough space under the door for me to kind of slide it just barely okay so I slide the mirror under and I tilt it as much as I can to try to look down either end of the hall to see who's out there the hallway is empty I slowly opened the door and kind of poked my head out and look around no nobody's there you are in the hall at the west side of the barracks in one of the smaller towers this tower is built into the keep properly and you've gone up to get to this privy you've gone up a set of stairs from below coming from the infirmary which is also on the second level of the key you see in front of you there's the doors that you just came through to get in here from from the Privy and then there's another set of doors that lead out to a walkway that walks that crosses the Great Hall and goes to the infirmary and then there's a set of stairs going that but also in front of you is a set of stairs going down to the where the Great Hall is and that set of stairs continues up and you at least remember when you pass by that that staircase went down one more time as well so it's like a central staircase in the middle of the key well I'm assuming the dungeons are down so I step out I look around I make sure that my monocle is straightened and my suit is tidy and I start walking with confidence down the stairs okay you walk down the stairs and as you start heading down the staircase there is a clatter from the staircase up above and you can hear the footsteps heavier footsteps of at least one other person followed by a few others coming down the stairs behind you and as you come down the stairs right behind you you can hear a voice saying is this some kind of his magic is he doing something out there is he trying to mess with us now I should have just locked him up what's happened to Sten you hear the familiar voice of the Lord Commander as he's heading down the stairs so Oscar is not locked out oh man so am i I'm just in a room and the key right now no you're on the stairwell and he's about to and the Lord commanders you're on the stairwell going to the main level and the Lord commanders like maybe one flight up above you I start coming down the stairs is there like any alcoves or anything or am I just on this staircase you're at the base of the stairs there's a door leading into the Great Hall there's another door leading into the tower and there is a statue of one of the patron saint of the hooded lanterns in front of you so there's the doorway into the main hall the stairs back up the stairs down and and the door into the tower I run up against the wall I crouch down into a little ball and I cast minor illusion to put a barrel around me and I just try to stand behind that iron barrel and I'm going to listen for more clues about where Oscars as I'm a barrel okay okay as you turn yourself into a barrel I make an illusion of a barrel around you you can hear the Lord Commander coming down the stairs and he is talking with it sounds like he might be talking with Ansem and he says Petra said that someone else came in as a about an hour ago we we took them to the infirmary I don't think that this this might have been one of theirs it he said he was a potion maker looking for Oscar urine as well and the commander turns to Anne Simon Says how did anyone know to look for Oscar you're in here I thought he said he came straight here after his after his manner was attacked if word has already spilled out this this Bigsby fellow that just showed up at our door could be an imposter could be one of the Queen's men we need to find that person and lock them up right away and make sure that they are actually not a spy we have too much of a sensitive situation right now to risk anyone else coming in why did we admit any guests into the building at this time and answer replies well the other who are the lanterns don't know who we've got here right now the commander nods I'm going to go check the situation out come with me you and 'some go make sure Oscar you aren't secure I'm going to go check out and see what's happened to Sten and with that the Lord Commander heads out the doors and Ansem heads down the stairs I I can't move my minor illusion can't know okay I look around are there any like other sets of clothing around there's several other barrels that you've hidden up around these these appear to be barrels of supplies I start so I I jump up and I start opening barrels hoping to find a quick non Cornelius disguise just anything that can make me look make an investigation check might belong here like a fancy hat I got a 21 you look around you remember there's nothing in here that you could use really as a disguise they're all provisions but you do remember across the Great Hall there were some servants quarters in a kitchen there might be something there and the other Tower that you were in as a privy did have some weapons and armor in it that maybe you could put on there's no time for that I need to follow Ansem upon looking in these barrels and deciding that there's nothing I had down the stairs after Anson okay you head down the stairs into the understructure of the keep you're in a long hallway as you head down the stairs make a stealth tracking are you Fateh you're tailing him Asylum him from as far away as possible ready that if he even starts to turn around I'm gonna become a barrel again that's my plan on my barrel but yes I'm tailing him I get an eight cool you keep you keep saying barrel out loud you stumble on the stairs and as you and head forward down the staircase and it comes into a hallway that has a iron gate that Ansem is opening up and as you step down the stairs he stops turns the key looks around it makes direct eye contact with you yeah what are you doing here I pull out my wand and I pointed at him and I yell flee my command okay what's the savings ready seat it is 15 okay come on come on don't think my bonus is high enough I rolled in 11 yeah I get a big old 11 okay as you point the one at a look of immediate horror surrounds Anselm's face and he turns and runs past the portcullis gate that he was opening up because he'd opened it and he's screaming and you can see right behind him there is another room looks like a guard room and there is this little old man wearing the hooded Lantern's outfit he's got a bunch of books in front of him and sets of handcuffs and manacles and and he turns up and says Oh young handsome what's all the screaming about and answers just like screaming bat back at him aye-aye I walk is the portcullis still open yeah yeah I walk through it and I turn to the little old hooded Lantern and I point my wand at him and I say tell me where Oscar is or else you're going to have the same or yell so you're gonna see what he's so afraid okay how long does the command effect last one round okay so Ansem runs back into the room he regains composure of himself and as you're pointing the wand at the old man Ansem comes to draws his swords and he points them at you and and says you just stay right there whatever you just did me don't do it again he turns and he says old Dan get one of those manacles petrol should have done this rate what rate when you came in and old Dan says I thought he was supposed to be one of our guests but all right I'll just get you one of the good old sets here all the cells are full with all those guys that came in with that old another guy though I don't have anywhere to put him right now unless you want to throw them in with more the other lot I pull my wand out and I pointed back at Ansem eye you need to tell me where Oscar yarn is I've way more than the abilities to just cast that I could blow you up with just a few words Ansem make an intimidation check okay say it say it again with a few words if I so desire it was the intimidating man and in the 426 okay he says you're serious I need to speak to Oscar Yan immediately it is of the utmost importance especially with what's happening out there so if you don't show them to me I will blow up your head and it won't be a good look for you he is his sword keeps the other one high Oh dad put the manacles down give me the keys and he takes the keys from old Dan his sword still pointed at you and he opens there's a cell door with bars on the be hot beside the desk with old Dan and he opens the cell doors and he says come on I don't stop facing him and he so he opened a cell door and told me to go in mm-hmm after you fine goes through the cell doors and there is a small prison a series of cells down here as you come step into the cell block there are three large cells in the cell immediately there it is filled with five members of the ostensibly of the Queen's men that have all been locked and manacled in one of the cells but they are all huddling against the the far wall up farthest away from the other cells because locked in the other two cells are about a dozen zombies and one massive ogre zombie and all of them are like grasping toward at the at the cell that the three Queen's men are locked in and they're just shivering and kind of in a cold shock there's another door at the end of the hallway before I go any further I turn to the old man the book keeper what was his name again old Dan Oh dad you better still be there when I get out or else I'm turning you into a newt okay all dances I don't mean no trouble now and you just stay in your seat sir continue escorting nice collection of zombies by the way okay he leads you to the end of the hallway where there is a room marked it may have once been the torture chamber down here and some knocks on the door says Lauren you've got a visitor and a voice comes from within I'm busy what do you want it's Oscar urine sir Oscar yarn i am Cornelius Mortimer Bigsby I've traveled very far in search of you and I'm here to rescue you I don't need to be rescued go away no Anson looks at you he doesn't want to talk to you that's fine I want to talk to him I can't make him talk to you you can go in there but I can't make him help you you go in first and some opens the door inside is a Oskar yarn and he's converted the torture chamber into his a workshop it is a macabre recollection reflection of his old workroom in read manner all of his things are here he's used he's using the racks to work on more creatures and as he turns around to face you you can see that he is noticeably paler than he was before and almost it looks of us as if he's grown three inches in height and his eyes are glowing solid purple on the desk in front of him is an array of all chemical equipment and several pieces of delirium and several large vials all of which appear to be filled with blood beside him is gamma assisting him with his work if my wand still out and pointed at Ansem i hold up the purple potion that I have and I'm like I found this amongst three dead adventurers and dragonhide did you make this make a deception check get a 12 he looks you up and down I love it when the dice work out in your favor I did I came for more the three that you found that were dead what did they look like there was a a cat a black cats with a crossbow there was a rather large looking fella wore a suit of armor rather handsome yeah the most handsome of them all was the sorcerer where did you find them they were down near one of the other gates that I used to get in here there was near the crater actually I believe there's a gate down there I'm not familiar with the names of the places in this city but I found them dead there were some rattling feasting on them yeah what do you want more of these potions and I came all this way just to find you it seems that you've given up your lodgings at your previous place where I was sent to to buy I have I'm not in business anymore I'm sorry I know you've come to a lot of troubles probably to find me here I don't know how you found me here how did you know I was here well word travels through Drakon Heim all the animals here seem to talk how did you know I was here some rats spied you and your cart moving this direction and I talked rattling rattling snow who I am rattling told you that Oscar urine made that potion rattling 'he's told you that I came to thee whose lanterns barracks it seems that the rattling 's have communicated with those three dead adventures and have learned a few things so I just put together a few clues I'm a little bit of an investigator you see make one more deception check 21 I get it 22 natural 20 that's a stretch I don't believe you and until you tell me how you found out that I was here I got no business with you you hurted Lantern I'm busy tell your commander that I'll have the next dose ready shortly and get out and some says I'm sorry mr. urine there was something else that I was supposed to bring you down here for but he he ambushed me in the middle of the hallway he he showed up just earlier and there's something's happened to one of our soldiers outside we thought you could take a look Oscar urine says this is madness because that is dragon will go back to pollute Oh Pluto the Lord Commander has come out the front gate and is surveying the muck of Sten oh now formerly known as Sten I'm gonna I'm trying to stay hidden whereabouts was I compared to the gate the main gate and then just at the intersection where the paths going to the gate that's where every all the commotion now is just right in front of that intersection on the on the street there and where did I last see veo you saw a veil go up into the latrine Tower there's a little side door leading up beside it so see there on the map there there's that small path leading to the tower there's a door oh there's a gate there as a smaller side port gate that that the hooded lanterns also used to get into the fort and now I see the Lord Commander he's he's outside looking at his melted friend yet has the GU got worse yes it is the black eye core is coalescing in the street spreading out into this block of morphus blob like form and the hooded lanterns are almost in circling it with spears and crossbows like they don't know what to make of this this thing I'm gonna keep circling around and I want to get closer to the west side closer to theirs MMH on her and I'm just trying to keep eyes on the outside yeah and I'm looking for anything and I guess I can't see these guys yet but as you circle around you can see that a group of hooded lanterns have come down outside that side gate and they've left it open and it appears to be unmanned as we go to veo because as they go rush veil you're back in the courtyard and there's a few other hooded lanterns that are heading out the side gate as you see the hood Atlantic the Lord Commander cross and the Lord Commander just looks up sees you in at the staircase by the watchtower points at you and says you there watch the port gate the rest of you with me I shuffle over to the gate longbow in hand ready and when I look out do i I do ask you skinny you see Pluto one of the bunker buildings along the side you see a very strange-looking hooded Lantern and the gate along this in the port gate and you realize it's veo it's the it's the walking on for it and I just kind of pop it up so you can see my ears my Papa bet down and put my hood back up and I motion with and come come come I do the most excited run I'm gonna run across the big gate they're distracted by and go right yeah yeah who's got them yeah you're able to run run across up to the port gate uh and there you can hurry him into the base of the tower yep where there's another cloak so another hood of lanterns cloak oh I definitely pop it on and say put this on act natural okay okay more humble more humble Jesus re very humble a hunched over a little bit more they think they know a lot you know so you have to I'll carry the bow and stuff I don't know if I know I did know I can you're severe no no no you can take spear I can use them yeah I actually I know how to use a bow you should have okay I need to you've seen the Lord Commander how to head out to the front the two of you are in the base of this tower but reunited what will you do [Laughter] we can always get another sorcerer kind of pat him on the back like no we have to go find our sorcerer no I know and we got a friend is Oscar here I don't know I honestly I've been looking for our friend Cornelius in order see but I really haven't seen much but you know I could go around say we you know lost the the new guests that we were supposed to be watching and see if anybody's seen him around yeah yeah I turned stand into muck and now we might only by seven yeah I was one of my good buddies oh um he's still your buddy he's just he's got a face for radio he's more of a more of a skull better behind the time anyways yeah we should probably might only buy us a bit more time I threw some of that goo from the mirror the gate yeah I don't know I what I was thinking I was really panicking great plan except for the fact that it killed one of my friends but kill him he's still friends good distraction though a good idea all right I like this cloak this is great that's good we have to go find our new Cornelius I have like blue and red and green mm-hm we're admiring oh yeah let's um I mean where's the last time I point to the area it's the keep has the infirmary I was like they would have brought him probably somewhere in the keep if they trust him if not they probably would have brought him down to the dungeon but I don't know where he could be he could be on any floor have you been here before oh yeah so you know kind of your way around and I wasn't really welcomed much here but I've been here a couple times to celebrate some things with the like birthdays and Christmas you know that the other buildings of stables and the lodge are not quite secure located like they're not places where the hooded Lantern's keep anything valuable aside aside from their own personal effects they're not fortified buildings like to keep is so I know we're gonna run into people we're going to keep its I mean luckily we have these great disguises yes I'm super disguised but don't ask act like a prince of caspia or else they're gonna know right away that I'm probably not gonna say many things okay but we have to go quickly yes I'll hide behind you cuz they could probably see my feline eyes okay to the keep go go go go clunk clunk clunk clunk and I'm like trying to say behind you what I'm like come on okay I'm going across the training ground towards the doors to keep heading up the steps where there are still two hooded lanterns in front of the keep doors both with Mastiffs veil you know these dogs though and they are nice to you oh they don't bark as you pass by because they recognize you I take a little bit of bread of that bread that I stole from earlier and I kind of pass it on like good boys good cool make an animal handling check 20 cool as you pass you pass by the the doors the keep are open there just because there's so many hood lanterns now running out and as they as you pass by a stretcher is coming out from the infirmary through the keep doors and you can see a few of the hooded lanterns talking and they're like I don't think this stretch is gonna be much good but we'll bring it anyway I'm calling a man standing and I I just as they pass him like yeah he deserves a stretcher and I try to like lower my voice one of the guards at the front just says stops and says instead okay did you hear what happened I heard there are some magic involved I bet it was that Oscar urine fella you mean that's strange there's been there was another strange-looking mage that came in wearing a suit was it him what mate I mean I don't know his name but he's the one we're supposed to look after gosh I feel so bad if he did something when he got away from us stens my three-legged race partner too so I have a lot of steaks in it you can both make the same [Laughter] great good 25:17 so are you two part of the long range crew haven't seen you I back here in the barracks for a while I think yeah we do a lot of uh we were called back in because of the attack on the gate that's impending yeah right right right lots of range like missions to go out and scout and mmm yeah give some information about the monsters we're always running the Lord Commander just came past this way and some supposed to be coming along soon to head on in thanks do you know the pass code for the dungeon I want to use the dungeon bathroom or did there isn't a privy down there yeah that's all that's all managed by old Dan you just go talk to him and the the dungeons full up though right now so wha we haven't been here have you seen have you seen the guy with the suit because we're supposed to be kind of watching him and yeah Petra took him up to the infirmary oh okay maybe we should go up there yeah and then and then we can maybe go see Dan later we'll see Dan mmhmm yeah old Dan oh good old day at all Dan yeah okay let's go up yeah yeah let's go alright see ya really good cool so you are now in the Great Hall so strong you're in the Great Hall there's a there are there's a long set of tables and chairs and the doorway one door is open and you can see there's a staircase they're going up there's actually a gallery level behind you as you come in you can hear there's all sorts of commotion running up and down and you can hear on the gallery above you can hear Patra yelling at somebody and she says where did that weird bigsby guy go I thought you were supposed to be watching him and then another hooded Lantern replies well there was the hold commotion and I wanted to go see what was going on he was in the Privy and then he was gone I don't know where he went and Petra says so we have some weird guy running around our keep we don't know who he is all this chaos happening we need to find him yeah we need to find him for sure yeah is he not up there with you Petra looks down across the banister and looks down it over at the the two of you she she eyes you up and she says we've checked all up here it's secure we're not admitting anyone past the the second level to the upper levels of the keep right now at all and no one's had up past this way he's either gotten out into the courtyard or escaped did anyone see him go at the fronts no we just came through to the courtyard is there any lower levels that we can check we can secure the lower levels head down yes head down to the dungeon I I think Anson was supposed to go down there as well double-check and see I think the Lord Commander wants Ansem to let's go find him right so if you can make one more deception check sixteen six Petra gets a six she's like we're on the night crew long range oh yes Lord sorry you just looked really familiar for a second and I start to push Pluto towards the where I know the bouncers be like thank you ma'am will door we'll go check downstairs and we'll get your brother cool as you come down the stairs and you as you turn to go down the stairs you recognise this old man as old Dan and he's running up the stairs he's like Oh any runs right up to you've gotta help that crazy weird look both guys kidnapped Ansem and is trying to get in to see the president get in to see that weird old weather wizard that we've got down there you've got to do something then show us where they are take this to that dam quickly in the prison level and he leads you down the and he leads you back down the stairs and you are now all on the prison level as well as you can over here Sebastian you can overhear this argument coming down the hallways he leads you through to the cells he says they're in the old torture chamber Murray's take it up I'll go get more help no dad no no no you've you've got enough help we've got this you know how strong we are I don't really recognize you I don't know how strong the lanterns are see don't worry about it they're like catchphrase what's there like their mantra oh gosh I don't know can I change for for Drakon hime long live Diwan castles and as they hear hear that Sebastian you hear two voices that sounds strangely familiar cry that out and start rushing down the hallway the hallways as Austria urine smiles back at you says well seems like your times up friend I am how well did I recognize those voices you're pretty confident is a mile ahead I am I look at him and I'm like we'll see about that Oscar and I say that in my normal voice and then I cast this is I don't know if this will work I mean the cast mold earth to make a ruin appear under Anselm's feet and I turned him I'm like if you leave that square that rune will explode make a deception check 26 he turned he turns in and a look of realization comes over on its face in psyche it's you crow I take the monocle gas gas and you take the monocle off as veil and pollute Oh bash down it coming back around the the the door and there's a look over recognition across both Ansem and Oscar urines faces and Oscar goes I should have known we need to have words Oscar it's an impressive amount of zombies that you have out there actually good job yeah I'm proud of you we re revealing but I might just like I pulled on my hood I take off my hat and I say I guess her guess we run disguising now really good to see you guys yes little Fe in here I've been on a long range patrol oh sorry I'm we're done right that's so good I turned to Oscar you can tell the clunk link then the down the hallway and I give him my scariest predator look that I can give him and I just say where is the Queen [Music] Ansem speaks up she's safe Oscar's taking care of her yeah that's the point of why we brought her to him but you liars we're not lying after him with it we have her now she is under our protection and Oscar urine is going to take care of her where is she yeah I don't know how you did it but you didn't have her at all Oscar urine did ya cuz we left her with him yeah yeah he was like our lockbox but that quest that we're on to go retrieve the Queen so that we can show her to you guys yet this is that quick we're still on it yeah you're the liars you already had the Queen apparently so yeah there goes the trust with the hooded lanterns I guess you guys are doing a great job Oscar urine arrived here after a meeting we didn't know during that meeting that he was gonna show up here he says that the three of you were working for the amethyst Academy and that you're planning to destroy the city boss that's a lie negative we've actually been protecting Oscar and I turn to him from the Animus Academy they wanted your head and the only reason you're alive right now is because I need to know where the Queen is if you want the Queen Oscar your honor applies you're going to have to kill me and every single hooded Lantern in this building that's fine I told you what would happen if you betrayed us I told you I would have your head Oscar if you betrayed the Queen Ansem says Vail you've been good and resourceful and you've been a friend of the hooded lanterns but you're on the wrong side of this right now I don't know how the three of you all got in here and it's insane to me that you got past us all but Oscar you are in a safe under our protection and so is the queen of Dragon I'm as it should be so all the agreements that we made in that meeting you guys just broke all of all of those agreements so I don't know that's that seems like you can take that up with the commander apparently but for now the three of you need to leave this room leave Oscar urine to his work and then we'll talk to the commander about what your fates are gonna be I'd like to remind you of the room you're standing on a friend yeah you can let that go now please I don't I'm gonna go get old Dan okay you head back down the hallway where all dan is he says Oh is everything okay in there yes old Dan I need the keys to the cells Oh what far you need to hand over the keys to the cells Ansel needs them okay here you go thank you old Dan and I'm gonna open every single cell in the dungeon I'm releasing all of the queen of Thieves all of the zombies okay as you do this as you as you get the keys Prison Break I guess we're making up her mind on Oscar urine says you three have one last chance to leave cuz I'm not going down without a fight we're on a mission to secure the Queen from the hooded lanterns so I'm a little confused on where we're supposed to be standing right now it's as simple as this this has got really murky tell us where the Queen is I don't care if she stays with the lanterns but the lanterns are not the only people that between is upstairs in the Lord commander's protection directly okay let's go there and you will never go up there why because no one is gonna allow you up there I'm gonna have to allow me up there I think we're past the point where these people are gonna be any use guys I saw the Lord Commander outside should we he's not up there yeah no we should just go up there okay whoa what sir what sir our plan was to rescue the Queen and Oscar from the hooded lanterns but he's here on his own accord and the hooded lanterns are protecting him in the Queen meaning that they broke the deal that we had made and are basically what was exactly the deal that we know the deal was that we were gonna go get the Queen from Oscar we were gonna Oscar yeren speaks up and some you just stay in that little square don't set off whatever explosive runes he's created again and I will deal with them you guys can roll for initiative yeah big thank you to accent shield for providing us with some awesome game accessories you're about to see the

break miraculously reuniting themselves in the dungeon level of the hooded lanterns fortress barracks where Oscar urine has set up shop once more our heroes are in the this dank torture chamber at the end of the prison hallway where there are three cells two of which are filled with zombies one of which is filled with some Queens men and Pluto Jackson is about to open one of these cells up as Oscar urine turns to attack Ansem in the room as well under a glyph created with mold earth that he thinks is going to blow him up and gamma also in the room is also in there the the half an apprentice that works under Oscar urine also you can see she as well bits of her hair are starting to follow and her eyes are now glowing purple as well whatever experiments Oscar urine has been doing on himself have certainly accelerated in some way we go to the top of the round pollute oh you've got the keys in your hand from old Dan are you gonna open one of these cells so I want to ask you a question yeah hi what does opening a cell look like in terms of like an action it's an interaction so if you want to just snap it open we'll say it's a bonus action okay so here's my plan I'm gonna open this know how many cells could I open in one turn one I'm going to run into the room mm-hm I'm gonna grab both of these guys and I'm gonna pull them out of the door okay and then I'm gonna lock the door that will be more than I'm gonna action search okay so then you want to run into the room and grab these two grab them like by the sky like by the backs of their okay and I just pull them through the door and I go time to go sorry Oscar bye okay and then as we exit the door I'm gonna close the door behind us and lock it okay make a strength Trek to grab these two and I'm so strong just strength yep 15 okay you pull both sebastian veo pushing them into the hallway okay we're gonna count that as basically you're shoving them both yeah right pushing them both into the hallway and then you're gonna action search to slam door shut and lock them and then lock the room okay that happens awesome interesting bye Oscar day what are you gonna do um I want to feel an agility and I want to - Can I grab Sebastian as I - forward yes but you can only pull Sebastian half your speed and you'll also need to make a strength check because you're not nearly as strong as Pluto and nope it's okay 12 okay you can pull Sebastian 12 feet okay so I pulled Sebastian 12 feet does that take away from my movement it costs to do that cost you 30 feet of movement okay and then I have another 30 plus with my dread ambusher I have another 10 feet and as I keep running I say guys we need to find the Queen to make sure she's okay locked the doors behind and I start to weave my way out of the dungeon that's my Mariana that's it okay oops interesting alright sorry Oscar sorry muck seeing the door slam shut and you all run out of the room Oscar urine cast dimension door and him and gamma appear at the end of the hallway no and he scowls at you all and says I've been watching you three very very closely and I know all your tricks little things that you try to do to worm your way out of certain death and you're not gonna get out of here alive this time hi Oscar oh man cool and with that we go to Sebastian in this cell next to Oscar there's three queens men yes I'm gonna use mage hand to grab the keys from Pluto and unlock their cell door right next to Oscar okay and I am going to run into this room while I do all righty as he appears at the end of the hallway i unlock the Queen's men gate and turn back to Pluto I'm like let's go and I just run through the door okay as you do that Jemma says not so fast and she casts Webb on Sebastian and Vale no what do we need to roll or we need roll to get out don't worry you're super what is it strength its dexterity and then strength to break out cackling she says they like that trick don't they boss and Oscar says yeah I wonder why they didn't try to counteract any of your magic are they running low on spells lots don't think about nothing about it okay next up we have Ansem who's under the room and is like you jerk don't you leave me here and with this that and the rest of the round the the Queen's men seeing their cell door unlocked they look at Oscar urine and they look at Sebastian they as they say we're I think we're good thanks we're just gonna just huddle in this corner until this is over we don't mean that anyone no nevermind and the zombies rail against the cell doors we go to the top of the round with pollute oh so where are the keys right now the keys are on the ground in the hooded lanterns in front of the Queen's men's door can I make it too I want to run it at Gemma okay yep and I'm gonna start it sorry Gemma oh I'm sorry it's gonna okra oh no I'm sorry whack her arm cool she might have tried to cast shield but that wouldn't have say that wouldn't help her 21 damage she is extremely bloodied but still barely alive and does the web hold no it goes down the web disappears as her concentration is broken and then I shove her I'm not gonna keep hitting her for ooh only 1/8 I get a one okay I shove her out of the way and I just keep running or actually I'm done running okay I don't want to hurt her I don't want to feel bad all right Vale you're up this door is unlocked correct yes okay wait is Gemma undead something's wrong with her but she isn't undead yeah I'm still trying to get away I turn quickly and I say should I call the guards on them he's not calling the guards on us no crazy magician trying to kill us okay fine I won't call the guards but I'm getting upstairs I'm right behind you all right and I dash out okay and then up the stairs all righty there's our you're up the stairs you're still in the hooded Lantern's garb but you've just pulled the hood down right and you can see that there is still some some commotion settling around but it seems to be largely contained outside now things are rather calm in the keep so you head back up up the stairs and now you're on the Qibla you're on the main level of the keep where do you want to go from here I turned back yell down the stairs keep going up up up the stairs and I keep going up okay next up is Oscar urine oh cool Oscar urine Cass says says Gemma you need to focus and he casts Bigby's hand Oh No appears and it comes out it's going to appear and it is going to try to grab Sebastian oh so so Sebastian it comes out and it appears and it grabs you and we can make a grapple make a strike check [Music] just just a strength yep check yeah you're gonna need to get a 25 well I got a this massive almost zombie like hand a spectral force appears and it grabs you Sebastian and holds you in place and starts crushing you you are you are grabbed by the hand next we go to Sebastian so I've just gotten grabbed by a giant magic hand and have very little that I can do about that is it another strength check to try to escape yep it will be your action and an opposed strength check against the hand let's see what happens I push with all of my sorceress might okay getting a 12 I get a 10 so you managed to push one of the fingers and squeeze through its just slip through the fingertips it like it actually it it takes off my disguise as I'm doing it revealing my Sebastian cloak underneath okay I was underneath but but it is it is an Ellen back you still bald I'm still bald with Chloe I want to make sure everyone knows that and I'm just following Bay oh I trust that you'll come gamma gets to her feet and cast mirror image on herself and we go to the top of the round with pollute oh I'm gonna run past the hand okay doesn't look it doesn't make opportunity attacks no beautiful then I'm gonna - I just kind of like squeeze past the hand and just keep booking it okay you are all on the main level of the keep now and we oh wait I have a question yeah could I have grabbed the keys were they on the ground yes you could reach and grab the keys as you run and then I get it yeah yeah and I'm gonna lock want this one of the doors on the way out of the yeah you could do that yeah the door rate between you and the hand yeah you can grab that lock it so that you won't be able to - but you'll be able to get it get away and I'll do that without occasion we go to Vail try to bail you are now on the main level of the keep which way do you want to go and I see Sebastian behind me yes you say Sebastian we need to find the Queen and then get the commander up here to have a little chat with him so we need to go up these stairs and so it's the same stairs I keep going up that the commander came down before and yeah I still keep traveling up the stairs okay you head up the stairs and at the top of the stairs before the commanders room is Petra and two other hooded lanterns and she sees you at the base of the stairs and she says Vale what what are you doing here we're doing what we agreed upon uh when we were at the meeting finding the Queen but we have a crazy madman downstairs trying to kill us it's a great welcome as usual with the hidden lanterns I heard she's in the commander's room are you gonna move for me Petra looks make an intimidation check 22 Petra looks back at you and says I don't mess with the muscle you if you go in there what are you gonna do I'm gonna make sure and do my duty to make sure she is all right you should go down and get the commander so he can have a little chat with him about what the heck is happening with you guys hiding the Queen we just got her Oscar urine showed up late last night here just as we were getting back from the meeting the commander Ansem these two and myself were the only ones that know she's back here all right so you've had a day to try to find out where we are we've been tracking Oscar to his house and to here we've got enough time to do that you didn't you didn't come and talk to us you've just showed up here breaking in actually we showed up at the gate that we were told we weren't allowed to let through which was what this morning so you've had her since last night we were told we were not allowed to get through the gate so as as a sign we took we were not those were the commanders orders and the commander should know that if you had the Queen we should have been let in so as far as I'm concerned we need to have a child with the commander now to figure this out don't forget we saved your life Petra you dude is but you three are acting like loose cannons will you go past here you go bail I'll let you past but I won't let you out of this building I'll lay your father deal with that part what we need to do right now is make sure that we're getting away from that crazy wizard warlock magic guy downstairs who's trying to kill us for us doing our duty to make sure that the queen is okay because that was our agreement we are supposed to be bringing the Queen to Camile we've chatted a little too long come on around so we're gonna we're gonna advance it a little bit back here - Oscar you aren't downstairs yep running okay for my loss Curran grabs takes the hand pulls it back towards the door in a punch and the hand tries to punch through the door that you closed to let him free getting a 19 it crashes into the door but the door holds steady and Oscar yarns growls and says gamma get yourself together it looks like these they've slipped through our fingers right now and he looks through the bars at you Pluto and he says you just remember I'm the only one that can help the Queen now don't think that you're gonna be able to talk your way out of this oh I'm not much for talking and I look at Gemma's arm sorry sorry about your arm cool Sebastian you're up next I guess I keep running I'm gonna dash up the stairs until I'm behind veil and then run straight into her and see Petra and the guards and I'm just like okay lovely morning yeah I see we have a little bit of a misunderstanding we do perhaps we should talk about it and not kill each other would be ideal for all of us I think all right patro says I I haven't even talked to her myself she's only the commander has seen her if you want to go ahead you can but the commander says she's really upset about something and she doesn't like to be seen she said he said that there's something really wrong with her that she's really sick are you sure you want to go and barge in there and disturb her we're the ones who have been taking care of her sickness we're the ones who brought her to ask her to look after that and Oscar's been tending to her well we want to know if there's been any improvement we're just trying to I just want to see my princess or my queen all right with that there's a crash and a bellowing voice as the commander steps in through the Great Hall and cries out where is that mage which one I look at Patrick I'm like this he mean me or Oscar I don't know Petra says if you want to go see him he's downstairs kind of want him to come up the time for diplomacy yeah I want to I want to see the Queen and talk to him with the Queen there I I'm gonna yell down the stairs parlez what is that Sebastian Crowe yes and there's a rush this pollute Oh comes up the stairs and pollute Oh makes eye contact with the committee no Jackson commander Lord Commander are you three behind murdering one of my men out there no we're here to look for Oscar and the Queen you didn't tell us you had him why were we left out in the cold he looks around at all the other he looks at all the hooded lanterns always happened around here I'm kind of giving oil and he says you all of you report to Commander Petra um captain Petra immediately Petra assemble these ones give them the briefing on what's occurred you'll have to forgive me most of my men don't know about our honored guests that's my bad Lord Commander it's just that you I thought we had a deal and you were kind of mean at the last meeting and we were going to get her and we left her with Oscar and then you had Oscar and we've tracked him here and as that Oscar urine comes out the stairs behind you with the giant hand still looming over him and he says Lord Commander these three are trying to kill me they're assassins sent by the amethyst Academy trying to steal my secrets actually we're here doing our job to find the Queen we just knew she was with him I feel like a big miss brings his hand to his head and says this is insane this is madness and all of you you included mr. urine need to start talking some sense immediately before some heads roll shut the door Petra bothered her arse where's Ansem turn off turn it off just turn it off Joran calm your scary hand of a spell there wait a few moments to talk but my temper has been flared and I have a dead man that has melted out in the street in front of us and I want to also know who's responsible for that Sebastian very genuinely yells down what do you mean melted I don't know I heard something happened to one of my friends and I'm not too happy about it either some dark magic we don't do dark magic you must be where's the Queen I changed this okay the Lord Commander says disarm now sheath your sword there's blood on it who have you killed I attacked a girl with web that was webbing my friend and I feel really bad about it Oscar urine speaks up and says Lord Commander these three are just assassins they should just be killed now and I was before they cause more chaos in the city if I was an assassin you'd be dead Oscar I'm not here to kill you I'm here because we're looking for the Queen and it's a little frustrating that you ran off and then you tried to kill us with your cloud and your weird insect people and we don't bring that up all the time and we're not all throwing that in your face the Lord Commander that you tried to kill them Oscar urine multiple times multiple times to be fair I think your persuasion gee I think we're kind of even yeah we also saved his life 15 all of you come here in the Great Hall and sit down I come down the stairs hands in the air with my wand in one hand not like menacingly like just holding it and I like walk past them I'm like any seat on the bench you're in the great huh do you come down do you come down the stairs but I want to stay close to the stairs the Lord Commander orders his men to close the doors around the Great Hall there's six hooded lanterns in the room all carrying their crossbows you six none of what is said in this room gets out of it do you understand me give their names and they all say yes sir Petra go get add some petrol goes off to get Anson so Oscar urine puts his spell focus down dismisses his hand and sits at the edge of one end of the table the Lord Commander standing at the other end he says I think the time for talk is almost expired but in light of the fact that I don't want to see this entire place blow up in front of me we can chat Lord Commander if I may the Lord Commander says no you may not let me make one thing clear so that we are all on the same page here this man Oscar urine showed up here last night with his cart and a bunch of zombies and begged us for safe quarter because he claimed that he had been assaulted by you three under the order of the amethyst Academy with knoweth and then when we asked him why he revealed to us that he had Queen Lenore in his care I can verify that he did indeed have the Queen and she's upstairs in my quarters where she is safe and being tended to she seems to be in she seems to be rather ill an illness that I am to understand Oscar yarn is working to treat at that I determined that you three were rogue agents and that you were not to be admitted in this end my orders to keep you from being admitted into the city remain unchanged as I've been working to assess this situation let me be clear if you are going to ask for access to the Queen if you were going to ask for the Queen to leave this building if you are even going to suggest that you may leave with your lives now and never come back to Dragonite they're under no circumstances will Queen Lenore be leaving the protection of myself and certainly not into your care however what we may discuss is whether or not I can trust this Oscar urine fellow because I need to know what has happened to Queen Lenore Lord Commander how do you know it's the Queen because I saw her and it nearly took my life me too been there bro i I don't want this situation to get any more out of hand than it already is we were under orders from the meeting that we were in first of all are you agents of the amethyst Academy no there may have been a misunderstanding involving that we we have done some work for them in the past but as you know you lie I saw you I saw you with my magic I watched you from afar and you didn't even know this invasion of privacy sir haha you've been playing me like a fiddle I've been keeping you alive Oscar the amethyst Academy wanted you dead and I made a deal with them it's only a matter of time and right now if you've been watching then you should know that we were trying to keep you alive so that you could continue your research we did that all I know is that you've been meeting with that scum Eldrick rune weaver okay so you guys have a little tiff going on and the Lord Commander says enough of this yes thank you you Caspian I tell me why you're here oh boy well I'm supposed to get some items back to my family things that belong to caspia I have a few on my list and I came here with about a hundred men and I lost them I lost them all except for these two and I need to get into the city and I need to find these items and give them back to my family they're treasures of caspia and they belong to caspia who and would who Lenore be one of those treasures of caspia Lenore is no treasure she's the queen yes but she's only a von Castle by marriage but a caspian by birth no I didn't I'm as stunned as you are I detect deception I was in a long patrol and I didn't remember oh yeah not uh you're not here for the Queen are you no I it's complicated if he was here for the Queen then he would have already had the chance to get her I trust Pluto I trust that he's not here for the Queen complicated as complicated this whole situation I dislocated Lord Commander you know as well as I do that the Queen safety is of the utmost importance along with her birthright and her heritage and her claim to the throne it's just that I don't know if we can I don't know if we can trust Oscar to give her the best care with what he's done he's tried to murder us several times he gave me a potion that I stabbed in my chest and it made me do things it made me do things to my armor I had to get new armor I gotta throw it all out all I'm saying is is that if the Queen's safe then I'm I'm happy but there's but these these relics they're I I think I think they're in the cathedral and if we work together we can recover them fine and I think we need to put some of this someone's dead and someone has zombies and whatever behind us okay we were in the meeting and I know we didn't trust you before but I trust you to make the right decision now right with that Jupiter Jones hate that guy I love him and I hate him I have such a torn relationship with him I don't know I don't know why he's here and that's this city but it worries me now Oh cuz he's Caspian - yes Norah was a Jones Jupiter might be after the Queen see what happens when we work together we have information on Jupiter you have information on Jupiter this whole this whole thing has been a horrible misunderstanding I tell you this if you caspian tsar trying to make some sort of play or claim the cards were fall where they're supposed to everything will come out in the wash as we say in caspia deo commander the Queen keeps asking about you and I've been wanting to know where your father is yes I know me and her I've discussed what our missions are the Queen has given us a mission unfortunately all of this political mongering has gotten in the way of me actually doing my duty to the Queen this is one of the reasons why I need to see her but also I want to point out the fact that Oscar said we came and attacked him at his house and that's the reason why he fled is a lie yes you just attacked me down in the dungeons we were never at your house until afterwards we came across an in shambles we also came down to try to find you define where the Queen was that's all this has led to his finding the Queen we could you hear us about you Oscar you three have been trying to play me since you walked into my Manor and I should have killed you that in there but I thought Oscar we were hired to kill you the first time that we met you exactly and I counted my lucky stars that you didn't wife we I figured that if I killed you the first time the Academy might sound send someone actually competent to do the job we brought you lilies yes you did and blood we give you lilies and boy it helps your research we didn't work with and then you turned it over to the Academy I turned a sample of it over okay we did do that don't use don't you understand that it was mutually beneficial we kept you alive for how much longer for as long as you don't double-cross the queen and then you did so I mean that's why we're here now fighting yeah Lord Commander the amethyst Academy cares nothing about dragon hime they care nothing about the Queen they care nothing about the city they only care about power and nothing more and luckily we're not with the amethyst Academy or else but you've been working for them we wouldn't have been near the call we would have handed the Queen over - had we been working for the end this Academy to that level we are here to serve dragon hime but unfortunately your magic your thoughts and actions of trying to kill us have gotten in our way of doing that we would have brought her to the spot that was agreed upon in our meeting commander or is that not still a valid no it's not oh and Queen is in my care now and it's going to stay that way have you talked to the paladin's about this no I haven't what would they think of your nagging on their agreement to be perfectly frank the paladin's can do whatever they want they can't the Queen is of upmost importance the royal family is of utmost importance and keeping the Queen protected and safe is the most important thing now grants for that I am greedy breaking you're breaking all the trust that was put out in that zone of truth room you're breaking it all I don't see that it that way of course you don't I'm open to working with the silver order I'm open to working with the amethyst Academy as far as its concerned as long as they have the good interests of the city or at least interest in controlling the city again helping us control the city again but made no mistake I want to see Drac and I'm brought back to the way that it used to be and I will bleed every last drop of my blood to see that happen and that means upholding the oath that I made to the royal family to protect them with my life and I cannot uphold that oath if the queen of Drac and I'm is if anyone's care but my own no we want her in your care but we want it to be also we need to know about it and the paladin's need to know about it because that's what was agreed upon is that neither you nor the silver order are in any position to dictate terms regarding Leonor and in fact that whole meeting was commander we are on the same mission and I I want you to consider that the reason we didn't bring her here in the first place because we know you'd be able to protect her to a point is that there's a greater threat in which we think is going to impact the royal family and Leonor and you know who that is and you know that we have told you that we have had experiences knowing that there's a mole also whoever attacked Oscar yarn in his home when we got there we fought we found a bunch of Queens men yes dead which leads us to believe that somehow once again maybe not through you but somehow the Queen's men are receiving information which is what we're all very concerned about yes and you announcing to everybody to half of my staff that the Queen is here deal in Intel slept out less than 20 minutes ago the only people that knew that Leonora LaVon castle was in this building or myself Petra Ansem and my other two soldiers upstairs none of them know that Pluto also calls Petra Queen yeah she's my queen queen of my heart my these six also know there's more people that know I apologize for that well I apologize on behalf of Pluto for them my Harold thank you right here Lord Jackson apologetic Prince I'm going to give you a choice you three if it means so much to you you can fall in line take the oath and you can be the Queen's personal guard and you can stay here until she is back to hell if it means that much to you then you can stay here and guard her yourselves stay as long as you like we'll give you all the food and board that you need [Music] we love our freedom well there's another question before before we go down that path is what about the Queen's men who attacked Oscar Oscar you think it was us who attacked you it was you who attacked me you saw the three of us yes interesting what Oscar say it again you saw us attack you yes the three of you came and assaulted me in my home last night did I have this javelin yes but we were in the meeting yeah you right hander you said that he arrived here right after our meeting so how does that doesn't pan out somebody attacked Oscar that was in Sebastian had this type of hair right yes you looked exactly as you do now bulb trapped you trapped you Oscar he got bald on the wall you're lying yeah I wasn't followed last night that's not true Lord Commander Gloucester did you staged the attack on your own home to frame them and now we're all doing the shifty eyes everyone's turned off yeah everyone just turns off screw urine Cornelius is a new look you lie that's correct [Laughter] Oscar is seething caught in his own lie cat got your tongue Oscar you have to be honest with us why did you frame us because you lied to me and it's only a matter of time now before the amethyst Academy comes calling for me you're under our protection Oscar oh so you made that choice the first time we met you they're coming and they're gonna be coming in force and they're not gonna mess around once they do I know that you think that we're incompetent but you have the choice of either having us on your side or against you and then you tried to fur and now you've given them all my research years worth of work and they're going to be able to have their whole run of this city that was all your research interesting cuz when you handed me the book you said it was only a small snippet artery's all of it oh so you're just full of it but if they're going to be able to reverse-engineer my own potions think of the help that we could provide to Dragon I'm with the Hays you think that they're going just going to just give that out freely ah you really are stupid I went to school there he's a little biased to that Academy we nice to me until there was the incident and then they weren't as nice to me and then they had to hire me Oh from elsewhere but anyway that's beyond the point that's a different story an Oscar well now that you know you've had it out with us I guess our your well-being isn't really our problem anymore so you can be rid of our help if you want I can still be useful I can still help with the Queen Oh are you sorry all these lies coming into your mouth are you really gonna be able because we have someone who can help and I turned to the Lord Commander and say remember the paladin's have strong magic as well as much as I know you don't want to work closely with them that was our original plan is to get the paladin's to help happens we'll kill her they'll see her as an abomination there's nothing wrong with her she's just transcended what she's become is a beautiful thing commander there's no cure for it commander commander what's happened to your beautiful queen necromancer there's nothing nothing that anyone can ever do commander the amethyst Academy happened to have a lot of Oscars research and are able to produce the same delirium potions as him perhaps with our relationship with the amethyst Academy we could get some wizards and/or spellcasters in here who know about the delirium who could help with the Queen in our verse now obviously only with you agreeing to it and only under your supervision not to mention we also have healers from the Silver order who may be capable of helping her rather than this pathetic necromancer who keeps lying through his teeth to try to save his own skin just saying let's create a new Dragon hime a stronger rocket yeah a better dragon hime but like the old one kinda like the old one but with a big meteor as like a as a tourist spot screw your asses No you three know you're out of options Oscar you've lied your way into a hole you've broken every bit of trust you've burned every Bridge what do you have laughs Gemma she was bleeding sorry jealous his God not even your God will save you now fine the Lord Commander says that it's greed what should we do with him I mean you have a dungeon downstairs you have any sort of like anti magic means no knock him out what would you normally do Lord Commander to a to a man of this stature in the old days we relied on the Academy for and the Saint Salinas to incarcerate spellcasters down here is just a break we don't we didn't keep prisoners here any long term you used to have a few mages on but they've all died now I don't think I'll be able to keep this man prisoner then you we can it's either a Sylar execution then yeah I think Oscar yarn the name of the Queen I'm going you are now under our arrest I have no cause to execute him he hasn't murdered anybody that's fair I and I mean he's practiced necromancy but on outlaws and bandits he was a very there's no rule of law here anymore can you still make potions for you can he be a prisoner here that continues to work yeah let go work for release program I think if he makes a thousand potion I won't do it I'll be revenged on you all anycast dimension door I'm so good at that see I commander minor illusion to make myself have hair again commander and I walk up to them I say if you trusted us in the beginning we could have told you all this but unfortunately you kind of put us in a tight spot protecting our mission to the Queen we want to work together but we need to have some lenience in order to do what we're here to do I'd like to see the Queen and talk to her about my mission if it's all right with you are we not gonna address the fact that a wizard just teleported out if you're claiming that he was going to revenge us Bluto that's a bad state of air to deal with okay it's a wine on the table I'm gonna pour myself someone I have some illyrian ale you want some no I think the free wine I'll take the free woman well this has been a very lovely chat compared to the last one we had commander I say I think this one went better commander if I do say so much the skirt yarn can teleport he do you think he'd go see the Queen I hope he wouldn't be stupid enough to do that let's catch this wait brush up eyes I feel an agility up the stairs faster than everyone okay upstairs the commander has allowed the Queen to have his quarters he's prepared a separate room he knocks on the door and he says Your Majesty are you there and you hear the Queen's voice say Lord Commander you can come in he opens the door and he turns back to you all it's safe foscar urine isn't here do you want to talk to her alone no together okay as a family yes as friends and I walk in and I want to first kind of peek in because I want to make sure that I know the last time we saw her her eyes were working again so I wanted to make sure that everything is safe my queen we're here to see you again don't be alarmed Oscar Oscar yarn has made something for her that helps the Queen was you'll pardon me it was a very vain woman and she well did you step into the room the commander has outfitted his his personal quarters as sumptuously as the hooded lanterns appear to have been able to manage it seems like they might have scoured through some of the brothels in the area for the finest things they could find we've been there and other bits a and they have outfitted this room with whatever fineries they've been able to find there's several oh swine that are on a table with some goblets a large bed that they have set up that is clearly not the commander's bed like this is something they brought in from who knows where for her was very fine and looking out the thin window is Leonor von Kessel she has changed clothes and it seems that someone in the interim period has laundered them for her because she is wearing a completely outrageous black dress it looks like she has bound herself for a ball it has like all this frill and this wide hat that she's put on and as she turns around she's wearing a porcelain dolls mask Oh interesting my queen is that you hello Vail yes it is Lord Commander these are your friends yes I think you'll have to speak up because she points to the mask and the mass you can see just on the side of it there is a small lever made of metal that's been imbued on the the mask and you can see that Oscar urine appears to have built shutters on the eyes of the mask and she says the doctor where is he my lady he's he's gone he has betrayed us Oh oh dear he made this this for me I can't see when it's closed but he says that none can look upon me now and I had not upon them lest they turned to dust he is right my lady but we are here to undo what he has done he has not tried to make you better and that is our goal is to try to bring back some semblance of your old self I am feeling strange but I am myself and I will not be argued over and shut away like some trophy what is it that you wish to do Your Majesty I I wish to see my children and I am to understand that something has happened to my city something that I don't understand this was a beautiful place and I see it now and it is still beautiful but in a different way she touches the mask steward Johan told me that he was going to go to the castle and find the children I need you to find my children well I have the portrait that we were given by you last time we saw unfortunately we have had some incidents happen in between and we've been shut out of the city by the commander so that way we cannot get in to look for them and we would like to know what you'd like us to do Lord Commander is it true have you borrowed the stewards daughter from the city and Lord Commander says yes I wasn't sure I could trust her see that that order is lifted Lord Commander yes your majesty I bow a deep bow thank you your majesty I'm here we are here to serve you and dragon hime lovely the Lord Commander speaks up and says he turns to you and says we have no assurance that the heirs are alive we've been looking for them for years we might be able to find our way into the castle the question now is who's gonna help the Queen and what do we do about the attack on the wall that's scheduled for a couple days in like two days parties more days two more days I think and this is just a thought I'm not ordering anybody or making any assumptions just want to get that out of the way what if we brought in the healer who we met from the silver order they are aware of the Queen already she may be able to take a look at her here under your supervision we can still help with the cathedral because we need to obtain that will and Cluedo would like to obtain a few things that belong to Caspian once again under the supervision of us and you guys and the silver order once we've taken care of the null problem then we should head to the castle and see if we can find any remaining members of the faun castle family Lord Commander have you been looking for them and he replies for years my queen for you for years that you still live is nothing short of a miracle and our greatest victory to date we've been fighting to uphold everything that we held dear Vale if your father is alive the Lord come if if the lord steward if Johan went back to the castle it's possible that he's trapped there it's possible that whatever happened to Leonor something like this could have happened to others it could have happened to the heirs it could have happened to the king gives us hope that they may still be alive but if we can get working on trying to find a cure for this then if we do find them we'll be able to get them back so I think there should be our first priority in working together with the different factions is to get this cure figured out I'll be honest I trust flame keeper Ophelia far more than I trust Oskar yarn agree we didn't know her at the time Oscar yarn was the only person we knew working on delirium so it made sense you found her and you brought him brought her to him it's frankly it's remarkable that he didn't do worse he knew that we would find him if he did we were pretty strict with him and it worked out so you have to give us some credit for that I hope she also is not in this condition when we found her she was in dire need of magical emergency she almost blew us out and without that if we had brought her here she would have not only killed more she seems far more lucid now now yes but you should have seen her when we get and at least contained by the flame what happens when she opens those shutters it's terrifying we agree yeah we saw a lot of that it was it was terrifying then and we haven't really opted to see it again just keep a mirror on you just in case yeah I used to Mir don't let her look in a mirror yep have you ever got delirium near her don't don't don't give her a delirium good to know she's been making some interesting requests she she still has a mind for fashion and she doesn't like wearing the same thing two days in a row we're finding it a little bit difficult to accommodate oh we have suitcases what he did he brought most of her things yeah we had some of her stuff to it tower we do have more of her stuff at the tower do you have anything in your bag by the way can I have my bag back oh yeah we're still gonna go to this meeting with the Paladins I don't think it wise to piss them off when we are dealing with this right now I think it'd be better to keep this alliance at least until short order where mmm-hmm we may not need them anymore do you think it's best that we still do the three-way strike on the cathedral and absolutely and then from there we'll follow the Queen's orders and my queen the castle is lost we can't investigate it until we hold the other gates of the city yes beyo and her companions will assist us we will find we will find what has happened to your children she says I miss them poor Leonard was just becoming a man and Katarina and Eliza still just young women it's been 15 years you say commander my children have grown up we will find them we will find them we have to find them now can we rest yes commander do you have somewhere that we can stay the night I'm pretty beat up from just lay in the Queen's bed like this I'd like to sleep outside her room if it's okay with you commander again while I'm here I would I would be honored to be as part of her guard we have a teleporting necromancer at large maybe in the room then I happen to know somebody who has a knack for hunting mages just saying we're going to need to deal with him in time and find out where he's gone we're also going to need to figure out quickly you mentioned the mole our little mole problem in the meeting well Oscar yeren was here he's going to go to the queen of Thieves that's the only other place that he can hide okay so we have the cathedral attack we have Oscar going to the queen of Thieves and I mean that's where I would if I were him yeah if they assume all all possibilities that but do you think this stronghold is going to be enough to keep out the queen of Thieves a teleporting mage and potentially more danger or else well we discussed before and I'm just gonna throw this out there and I don't mean this to sound harsh but three idiots just infiltrated your entire base so either you need to say right now that we are competent or I need to admit that it might be easier to sneak in here then you think by the way you smell terrible there how did you get in here tomorrow morning I would like you to meet with my soldiers and explain to them exactly how you got in here you're a maid yes yes as well I'd like you to investigate this black goo that my soldiers found outside it seems to have consumed one of my men absolutely touch it Isles and I need a sample yes we can we can see to that I suppose all of Oscar urines lab equipment as yours now we should also gaining laughs yeah like trash it just in case he comes back for it he might be down there right now like scooping stuff up Ansem should take care of him we ransom and Petra they Ansem Petra's freed okay tell him we're sorry we didn't mean to we're just trying to do his best Thanks and so for the first time ever I actually walk up to Anson and I'm like I'm really sorry there was a miscommunication by the way that ruin wasn't going to explode and I was out of spell slots but you did a great job standing up for yourself he shakes his head there's a test it was a warning warning show and you passed you passed you're lucky that you got out of there quickly I was about to shoot you in the neck I'm glad that you didn't and I'm glad that I didn't blow you up and now we can move on and be friends under the bridge Petra also turns and says unfortunately Lord Commander the three the three Queens men that were in the cells seem to have escaped during the chaos Oscar it was ah man it's so frustrating he was just like he was causing so much chaos black goo outside there's men escaping and you say that Oscar might go to them do you know where that do we we don't know where they could have gone do you know any how far Oscar you're on might have teleported how he might have disappeared my estimation what's what's the furthest you've been able to teleport I can go approximately five hundred paces I'll send some of my men out and see if we can catch them and he hasn't gone too far you should also go back to his original lab yeah he might he might go back therapy my try well so you're welcome to stay here I'm sorry that we've had so much distrust between us the Lord Commander says but it seems now we are all aligned agreed yes as we should have been it is as it should be I only have what's best for this city at heart I need you to understand that we need to trust each other there can't be any more secrets between us we're going to work together productively I agree yeah I think all our secrets are out on the table and know that they they came from a good place that came from a place of wanting the city to be the best that it can be and the protection of it but I think we're aligned now I think we were all a little wound up on the whole protection thing and had different views on that but as it turns out we all we were all working for the Queen the whole time I can see that now you have to understand that for me having the Queen under my protection is the only option I do understand that you were brought up as a member of the elite soldiers to looked after the Queen that's your duty that's your way of paying honor I hope that you also respect though that with Jack and I'm in the state that it's in we also need access these are the Queen as well because things can go wrong and we trust you but you need to trust us like you said and I do think it's important that we talk to the Paladins as well and get their healers in here because they have very powerful healing magic and maybe we can do even better for her in the meantime he pulls out the portraits of the Queen's children these portraits are 15 years old they're like a local artist who could like do a what they might look like yes but this sniffer doesn't like full disclosure I'm really sorry I spilled the black goo I didn't mean to it it murdered his face I didn't know I thought were I'm just I feel like there's a lot of trust right now and I wanted to get it out of the table Lord Commander I'd spilled the goo yeah I feel like if we're just doing clean slate fresh start I didn't know he's gonna melt his face I'm super super super sorry he can go to jail I didn't I didn't know that was happening neither did I I didn't know I was gonna melt his face to be fair we encountered that goo before and it didn't it didn't do that I just felt like you were just saying all these things about trusting and I was like I didn't want to hold any secrets it's still out there can you go magic it up yeah I'll be back Lord command where did you find that I got it out of a mirror how did it end up in the street I spilled it pocket I'm so sorry do you have any other dangerous potions or devices with here that you found it in the city we pretty much keep everything so just like full disclosure I'm sorry I'm sorry sorry about what's-his-name not MUC and all right a proper eulogy slash like war letter to his family okay for you that's where we're gonna end it but that you from here Gary Baio came out today you will have still three days before the meeting with the paladins and going forward with the attack on the gate for all of you we are gonna be
