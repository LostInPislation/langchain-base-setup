renown and revenge [Music] good evening and welcome to Drakon hime this is our weekly Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition game with the dungeon dudes that's me you're a dungeon master Monte Martin and I'm Kelly mcLaughlin playing Sebastian Crowe the half elf shadow sorcerer and we're joined today by our good friends til tinnitus playing BIOS any edita back seat gloom stalker Ranger and Joe O'Gorman playing Pluto Jackson the human battle master when last we left our heroes they had ventured deep into the inner city of Drakon Heim their destination Queens Park Garden after one of the elusive eldritch lilies said to grow they're sent by their associate with the amethyst Academy River to collect the lilies so that they may be brewed into some sort of concoction by their earlier contact Oscar urine the mage who dwells on the edge of Drakon Heim venturing deep into this old garden dedicated to the Old Queen's of Drakon Heim our heroes encountered strange creatures women twisted by the magics inside the city and strange murderous gnomes who tried to kick them in the head successfully successfully they managed to find a single elder to Lily though the creature that they encountered a handmaiden that lived in the castle that ger that they are recognized by the name of Gertrude said that a mysterious creature known only as the lady desired to own all the eldritch lilies the lady had taken over the grotto dedicated to the old queen of Dragon hime Lenore and so our heroes ventured forth to this grotto within the garden after battling their way in past some swampy drudges defending the outskirts of the grotto they encountered Gertrude once again who warned them to leave an offering before leaving the site forever but instead they continued because they found several more lilies in the underground grotto as they were beginning to gather these lilies up a set of doors opened up and a figure stepped forth clad in a black mourning gown and wearing the Emerald amulet of Queen Lenore as our party tried to talk their way out of the situation by having to drown veil in the water and it's a very conversation they aroused the ire of the lady when veil through and eldritch Lily in Pluto's face destroying the plant you were lightly being drowned dagger being drowned a little bit yeah I don't like water at the sight of one of her lilies being destroyed the lady at the figure ripped away her veil that concealed her face revealing a face that they are recognized but one twisted by strange magics the figure resembles that of Queen Lenore the fair and stately woman that once ruled that dragon hime alongside King Ulrich but she has been changed by strange forces her skin cracked and breaking in her hair transformed into these strange wispy cables that end in snapping Maz as she turns in her rage aroused and all of you screaming screaming out first to kill veo ordering sebastian and Bluto to do so he did she screams out you shall not destroy my lilies I'll have your lives she cries out what will you do hmm I kind of ate one of the lilies and I have veil I almost picture like I'm rolling by the scruff of like your we're still holding yes and as you freeze looking up at her she's torn the veil away you can see her crack skin is almost like scales and suddenly a strange light begins to emanate from within her throat nostrils and eyes it has the same green pallor as the light that's emanating from the rest of the area and as it emanates from her this strange radiant energy you can see in the room beyond where the lilies are all the lilies turn towards almost facing the light like sunflowers following the Sun and the lily that was cracked on the ground in front of you almost begins to rouse and awaken as if drinking in this light is rousing it on the other hand this light that's emanating you feel it rippling through the air and it might make you it might not be pleasant for this to touch your skin this light tell you have one round to tell me what you're going to do and then we're going to roll for initiative who has ideas looking at we've dealt with melty face ladies but this is like melty face boss and Pluto can sense that we're caught off guard hmm I kind of want to throw Vey out towards the doorway in the nicest way like you pick her out of the pond yeah yeah I need to know what you're going to do you don't have enough time to discuss I'm going to carry veo towards the door the exit yeah the exit the entrance exit okay and and and with my other free hand I'm gonna be pushing a Sebastian okay Sebastian what are you going to do I guess I'm also moving towards the door we have enough eldridge lilies I'm I think so yeah this seems a little daunting at the moment and also I don't really want to kill the Queen so as Pluto shoves me I'm like okay okay let's get out of here and I start heading towards the door do I have to actually taken action well we'll be rolling for initiative when you actually want to move okay oh are you so you're pushing me like are you happy I kind of pull you out of the water okay cuz I'm sorry and yeah I think we've overstayed our welcome Oh time to go whoops sorry and like if you're pushing me like towards the exit I'm yelling at her just like my queen would never hurt me and I'm just like getting a bit riled up here because like I don't think she's my queen because the Queen like I knew her and she was gentle and kind and she knew me and this person doesn't know me so I'm I'm kind of I'm Phi C but I'm not I'm not against you pushing me towards the exit I'm just not moving there per se of my own will okay when you back to we shall roll for initiative holy back holy back the poker face oh crap eleven eleven prepare twenty-one present oh crap it was five five big old five my streak continues I didn't I you know a little time off different you know didn't keep the dice from sorry for the cold okay this figure who we can only call by Queen Lenore since that seems to be who she resembles she walks forward down the hallway let's see our map she's she's standing at the double doorways at the end of the hallway about thirty five feet away from you there is a great between you and her that is still closed you haven't opened it up yet Sebastian you are the first to act she is walking towards you this green light just flickering at the edge of your face and as you kind of turn to leave you can see almost that even the bars of the cage in front of it are warping under this light like they're starting to degrade and chip a way rapidly that's normal no so Sebastian is going to kind of run to this side of the door and push himself against the wall okay and he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out an aqua delirium and he looks down at it and he's like I have no idea what's in this thing but here it goes and he knocks it back alrighty rola d4 or sorry a d3 that is one alright you regain two levels worth of spells I will give myself a second level spell slot back okay and please note that you have now drank one vial of this if you drink another it will be pretty bad noted as you knock back the potion you feel it head down your as it heads down your esophagus you can feel like this surge of arcane energy just shoot through your blood veins and all of a sudden the two of you see his eyes glow a bright purple and you can see his blood veins all through his neck and into his hands and in his face begin to almost bulge out but they're glowing purple underneath his skin as his metabolism is drinking this thing in for a moment you almost turn pale your lips almost like a blue-black it almost looks like someone who is suffering from hypothermia after he as he drinks this potion down but he's standing there with this motion in his body in this system Sebastian it feels lovely it's good it's like a warm bath but inside would you like to do anything else she got him oh god I am going to also use a bonus action just to transfer some first first level spell slot into some sorcery points okay and that's it for my turn already next up is Vail so I can I see what's happening to the door as well yes you can see it's it's a for a moment it looks like it's melting away and cracking and then turning and almost transitioning from metal into just dust so I see this happen I also turn and see Sebastian avenues me a moment no just like this be crazy and I start to just like kind of hustle towards the door a little bit so I want to get inside like the the doorway okay and I want to ready an action because I feel like now that the Queen's happenin her minions might come back on the other side so I just want to ready my longbow for anything that I see come by okay Queen Lenore she steps forward a few feet and she says yes RonRon leave leave my flowers have you taken any of the flowers though with you oh yeah there were three in the pool okay so we have two of them other than the crumpled-up one that was throwing it seeing this she says give them back bring me my lilies give them back and she begins walking forward she's about halfway towards the gate Bluto it's your turn you can see her down the hallway and this light begins to wash over over you if you wish you may now choose to avert your gaze I do that okay averting your eyes you feel it against your skin it's like the heat of a blistering summer day and even where where though you avert your eyes from it you can feel almost your skin boiling inside your arm or like there's blisters pop cropping out underneath of it and I still need you to make a constitution saving throw the helmet oh cooking yourself in an oven which nine-nine okay those rolls man you take ten points of radiant damage zapped and you suffer one level of exhaustion ow so you shove us forward and then you don't that's a great sin Pluto you're up yeah what are you gonna do with his turn I'm cooking my own cooking inside your armor and it's not like fire it's like pure radiance and it's it's almost like intense radiation is emanating from her gaze I'm going to looking away from her her it I'm looking away and I'm gonna run because I saw Sebastian his eyes went crazy too and yeah I'm now worried that he's affected okay so I'm gonna try to run and grab Sebastian and book it towards the door all righty you run and you grab him Sebastian you know resist being grabbed yes okay you can make a pose strength checks you're coming oh you're just so confident in my lower all 15-6 you're coming by you grab him and pull him with you come on Sebastian and then I have a plan and I'm gonna start carrying him towards the doorway and then is it my action to grab him yes then how can I make it my whole movement even with him am i strong enough you can pull him the rest of your movement

15 feet up the stairs okay okay we go to the top of the round with Sebastian are you within 30 feet of uh I don't know you or not okay so he's pulled you out of her range okay so the light emanating from her it can and as it catches into the middle of the room and oscillates off of the lake in the fountain in the middle it bounces all the way around the room if you were wondering what was providing the light source to the greenhouse where all the eldritch lilies are growing this was certainly it and even in like even in your packs the lilies are almost you can almost feel them like rustling like they're trying to move towards the light that's emanating from her creepy creepy creepy Sebastian what will you do are we leaving I am I have I carry I own you now so you're going with

stairs and an 18 another 15 I you break out of his grasp okay I'm gonna run back into the room and I don't wanna I don't want to go too close but what I want to do is the light kind of like shining out yes yes I want to pull the mirror out of my thieves tools kit okay and I want to try to like shine the light back at her like averting my eyes but I just kind of want to hold the mirror interesting okay can i mage hand hold the mirror and move the mage hand in yes but you'll need your action to cast me a chance right and I just used my option to break it mmm I don't have enough sorcery points to that okay I just fight off Pluto and move back to the door okay stay there behind the door okay Val what's thirty feet out we've got one of the measuring sticks right over there if

gone he left me here where is he gone where is he gone and she steps forward and she rocked she wrestles her hands against the grates of the door and begins pushing it open yeah she be and she she presses against it and pushes it open uh-oh and begins walking into the room and she says come back come back where is he gone where has he taken my babies Pluto it is your turn you are in range of her radiance will you avert your gaze yes now okay I like to think that I still need a Constitution saving I like to think I'm half way up the stairs okay cuz I I think for the miniature to live on

quite in her sight yeah I'm gonna chore to grow go grab Sebastian again okay and try to pull oh I'm like give me that constant like Constitution saving throw I'm just trying to like wrestle you kids like I've been pushing veo and you and you're like fighting me back come on 21 okay so you totally resist it as the as this light comes forward you feel yourself but you grit your teeth feel yourself boiling but you feel grit your teeth and rush up to sebastian and what do you do I grabbed him and I pull them back okay so it's the stair I don't resist but I'm just like just let me try one thing and so like he's kind of pulling me away but I'm still like looking at the door getting ready to do what I plan to do okay we go to the top with Sebastian Serkis he's pulling me kind of a slide here oh yeah do I have to make the save with do you want to avert your gaze from her entirely or just try to shield yourself um I'm gonna avert my gaze I know that she's come through the door I can tell by like the light emanating and the voice yeah I get that idea so I'm gonna avert my gaze give me a Constitution saving throw win advantage nineteen okay you feel the radiant energy emanating from her burn like it's almost giving you a sunburn at this point but you met but it you press on through the pain of the radiant light and you may act as normal I am going to mage hand okay and grab the mirror for my these tools kit and just float the mage hand up to like five feet in front of her about ten feet in front of her face and hold the me okay alrighty would you like to do anything else no that's that's my big move I'm gonna see if anything happens if it doesn't work we can leave okay the mirror flies forward and Leonora looks upon it and sees her own face and you can see a look of horror and revulsion as she sees her reflection in the mirror in front of her she fails her saving throw and as the light reflects back off of her face you just see this look of horror in her she collapses to her feet and the the light almost is burning away like this first layer of whatever this crusted scale has formed on this honor flesh and you see this tender like post sunburned flesh underneath her skin as she falls to her knees and begins weeping and the light stops emanating from her face what did you do magic oh yeah wicked and you can hear her she she falls to her knees and she begins weeping and crying loudly like almost hysterically so I I do a really awkward like I'm still pressed up against well I guess you grab me and we're trying to drag me away from the door but I like I do a quick quick little peek around and kind of look at her does she seem like there's no light the her her eyes are closed and almost leaking this like I core from them her and the scales have been burned off of her face and the these cable-like tendrils that end in malls are still hanging down around and over her face but they're all hanging limp some of them bits of them the own radiant light has burned them themselves away you can actually see that the as she falls to the ground the Eldridge Lily which that you through which still lays on the ground it begins to wilt and die in front of her veil I did something what she she's different how different she's not glowing and she looks sad instead of terrifying my Creed that's all I got I don't know how safe this is but situation is more under control than it was a moment ago Meijin is like your most powerful ability you have killed more things or you've just I think you just your magic hand just kills things like you melted that lady's face and then you melted this lady's face I yeah I've done never underestimate the power of a good magical hand give them give him a hand give me I would say that's some pretty good handiwork they're so proud meanwhile though like Queens crying in a corner yeah and and she kind of begins pulling herself over to the corner of the wall and like she's huddled in the in the corner and her hands over her face these awful tendrils still coming down there it's almost like the the tendrils themselves are dead now and they're they hang limp around her head the blast of light from the mirror has just shocked her out of whatever this state was from behind the door the last thing that I'm gonna yell is just my queen my name's Sebastian Crowe and we're here to rescue you thank you okay I think well we'll pull ourselves out of initiative for now pollute Oh what would you like to do you seen this happen as you were pulling Sebastian away he turned around reflected the mirror that brilliant light is gone oh the if the sunburn is over I'm going to cautiously raise my shield and sort of like walk into the room towards the Queen I consider this the turning point okay I'm like is it don't turn down don't turn on don't you don't and I kind of want to pin her on the ground with my shield like I want to get real close on the ground just pushing her into the ground like but they and just imposing my shield between okay as you stand over her she looks up for a moment and you can see whatever has happened to her face it's it is like a sudden sunburn hit her in the face and you can see this fleshiness underneath it where the scales still come up her neck and around her head but then there's this humanoid like fleshy burned face in the center that is marred her fair features and as you come up you can see her her eyes are just bits of blackness that are leaking almost like mascara is leaking but it's not and as you come towards her with your shield in front she pushes herself backwards towards towards the wall and says no no no no don't hurt me don't hurt me don't hurt her I won't hurt you but no more glowy sunburned face to me she says I don't know what you mean yeah that classic classic burn your face and act like nothing happened my my body is like thirty degree burns under my armor it's very uncomfortable there what were you I'm as soon as I hear him don't hurt me I'm like don't hurt her and I down the stairs and I'm like my queen how are you doing okay is he hurting you don't hurt her oh yeah yeah no problem I'm not the one that shot her twice to be done yeah you can see the arrows are still sticking out of her side she's nursing the wounds definitely go help her out yeah I know how they okay make a medicine check putting a bat on me don't hurt her six you pull the arrow out violently and she screams and you can see in a in a moment there's a flash of green light in her eyes and she growls I at you and grab grabs you reaches to grab you and pull you pull you close to her what will you do don't hurt her don't hurt her okay make an attack roll see what it sounds like 1700 you smack her in the face and as you do so the the I course slams turns back around to face you and you can see that her eyes are gone whatever happened when Sebastian turned this light around has burned her eyes away oh oh it's a new day oh by the way if you can see me I'm sorry you slap her then you're like oh it's available so you can tell about the slap maybe I'm a bit disturbed I get up and start to move away and I say you may have been my queen but I don't know what you are anymore she she's whaling on the ground you've slapped her you pulled this arrow out of her and it seemed like in that moment she tried to like muster up whatever power she once had but whatever has happened to her now has broken that strange power you're you're scared yeah you're I'm glad you're my bodyguard you're the one who was saying that we needed to protect her and you're the one who shot her twice and slapped she says from don't don't touch me okay and she she hold her head and her hands over her eyes and she she says I can't see I can't see where was where was Vale where did she go and I go back over and I grab her hand and she I'm here okay what are the I'm gonna give Sebastian a little whistle like that to kind of like look at me I had popped my head from around the door but like very cautiously like I almost do like a double take I'm still really nervous and I'm like what and I'm gonna motion towards the other room and I go as I stand here with veo interrogating slash comforting slash doing some sort of like first aid I actually I also want to take maybe some cloth and like wrap it around her eyes where they were okay as Sebastian begins walking down the hallway the other the other set of doors open and the three women from before come in come rushing in led by Gertrude and they say and they look down at Lenore they look back at you and they say what have you done what have you done to our queen first aid she hurt herself persuasion check she fell on these arrows and we're trying to get them out they're really bad splinters Gertrude rushes towards the Queen I'll give her space and the three you can see they they rushed towards her with the cadence of handmaidens trying to protect their queen and they pull her tour towards them in the end Gertrude looks at opment Belluno and says get away from her you monster what have you done to her she kind of did this to herself literally Sebastian are you two still walking down the hallway um I'm too mesmerized by all the glowing lights in this room well they're having this conversation yeah I continued I continued to walk towards the room full of lilies okay Sebastian you can see in this room it is a pillared beautiful room resplendent with reflective panels and frescoes all overhead you could imagine that if the Queen in her when she had this ability it would have reflected all across this room with the brilliance of daylight now the pool in the center is filled with lilies Brisky with light there could easily be a hundred of them and though many of them now they don't they're not perking up the way that they were before when the light was shining they've all kind of come towards rest a few of them and almost as like they're starting to wilt but you can see that this room across the way there's a large stone bench almost like a throne with a tapestry behind it and beside it has been arrayed a small table with several bottles look it looks like they may be bottles of wine long empty and there are several large trunk like chests some of them are strewn about and within are all manner of opulent and ruined women's clothing several dresses bits of jewelry various gowns and other bits of royal attire some of which are scattered in the water some of which are ruined some of which are still hung up around the the trunks and beside them is what was you can see the frame of a mirror which has been smashed to pieces and all the pieces of it flown all over in different directions there are several books and Ledger's as well and you can see that standing up around the throne are several large portraits there about enough that a person could carry them maybe about 18 inches across and the portraits are all fit are all hung up and it looks like there are several portraits of the royal family and the royal children as well probably as they were about 15 years ago so not even creepy or anything is what you're saying no just a normal room well the room is uh it looks like she was with with lilies and weird paintings and looks like she just like moved the Queen moved her stuff down here um I actually I turn around and I'm like I think she was living down here all of her all of the Queen stuff there's a bunch of Queen stuff over here I I'm going in did you say that one of the one of the handmaiden speaks up and says no those are the Queen's things you're not to rob her I'm not robbing the Queen just picking some flowers make your persuasion jack nineteen yeah those are those are the queens Lily's she keeps them here those are hers you're a thief we're here to help the Queen she might need these you're here to help her yeah I'm like crawling down the hallway yes one of the handmaidens looks to Sebastian and looks at veo and points at your crest that's that's master yo.hannes did he send you has he come back for us no he didn't he's been missing for fifteen years now fifteen 15 years when's the last time he was here she looks back at you and the three women look as I say 15 years yes it's but no no II just left lot yesterday it was just yesterday that he and and the three of them start to say it was wasn't it just yesterday that he was that he left us here and they started talking towards each other like they're trying to figure out how long they've been here I say what what was yesterday to you what happened yesterday Gertrude says I thought there was a light in the sky an explosion a wave that awful mist we were here with the Queen we hid we didn't know what else to do we've just been hiding here and then the Queen asks us to go get get the lilius and bring them back so that we can live so we could stay it's only been a few days he's coming back right it has been 15 years since the day where the meteor fell and I've been looking for my father ever since I used to be a young kitten living in the palace and I'm all grown up now jiya grown up it seems like they're in shock the Queen has been weeping all through this like she hasn't been paying attention well up to it ladies take her to your quarters and tend to the Queen at once they shake themselves up and they help the Queen to her feet and they begin bringing her back towards the her room no no the you're out your room she can't go in there oh do we yeah we do just I'm shoving but how many lilies can I fit in my bag how long do you want to spend as long as this whole conversations been going on I've been driving as you okay you the there are probably more hair than you can carry on your own oh I know okay so so let's see if we can fill it anybody grab a pot somewhere chest and William also uh I'm gonna kind of follow Gertrude and the others carrying head Queen they bring her back to the to the lily room and they set her down on the bench like throw where her things are and begin tending to her and like they're like trying to soothe her one of them goes over to one of the the chests and tries to see if there's like there's like the remnants of a first of a healers kit there and like they're trying to do things they're singing softly like they're trying to like placate her it's almost like a mockery of several handmaidens that would be tending to a distressed queen but everything they try to do is completely incompetent are you back your rhythm yeah the guy I follow them into the room because I'm trying to keep them distracted while you grab the lilies like you know slightly imposing myself in between them yeah I'm just I'm just there as you guys enter the room I kind of stop watch many emergency man as as they continue to tend to the Queen I continue to fit as many lilies as I can in my bag okay you probably got about two dozen over there and then it's like all right guys uh well it seems you all have it on under control so we're just gonna be go I tap you on the shoulder uh do we want to like bring the Queen back somewhere I mean maybe somebody can help her maybe somebody can I mean she's the queen of Dragon time we do we just leave her here I think the ones that I would be able to trust the most with her would be the hooded lanterns I think she has a great place here and I don't want to take her out of her in life it was like just ready to leave I don't know if this is the best place I mean she's got her handmaidens she's got her clothes here and her throne and and she's blind a lot of lilies she's got a few lessons yeah they cannot nothing but not not a noticeable amount the Queen of Dragon hime to be taken care of Pluto no she's being taken care of not very well I mean someone shot her with some arrows early house really took a turn for the worse this is an important situation here this is this is the Queen I mean I know you don't understand you're from caspia do they have like do you have a king and queen in caspia yes okay if the Queen was missing uh it's because it kind of feels like we're kidnapping her I feel like she would do better in her own quarters we're getting her back from being missing all right I guess we're putting this to a vote all in favor of helping the Queen and getting her to the hooded lanterns raise your hand well you're carrying her because I didn't shoot her and I'm kind of holding a grudge cause she burned the minions can carry here I turned to the three maidens and I say I'm gathering elder jellies because they might be able to be used to create medicine that can help her we need to take her somewhere you are welcome to come with us oh we should bring her back to my Tower and I can use my pigeons to go send a message to the hood lanterns to meet us at the tower because we said they could use it and that's closer yeah I know me a couple blocks away that way we don't have to go all the way back to the gate okay yeah and that way she'll have a little safe haven she doesn't worry about monsters being down as dank dirty place like and she'll be out of the haze some fret yeah exactly I don't know if that'll be detrimental or helpful but no I like your plan I'm purposely not looking at Pluto feel him staring at me I don't know what you have against all of our plans here Pluto we need to help the Queen this is numero uno I mean if you wanted to help her not burning her eyes out would have been a great start I wanted to leave her to her I'm pretty sure that burning her eyes out was exactly what needed to happen I kind of welcome remember not murdering her if anything the most dangerous thing to the queen is Vail and she's we're going to hurt our it like I really feel like this is a kidnap I'm feeling we're kidnapping her I really feel like you're trying to convince us not to help the Queen and I don't know what you're up to right now Pluto I feel like this is an obvious choice she's baggage we we came for Lily's not a queen it's great no that's extra twofer this is like Pluto finding the queen of Drakon hime is extremely important the whole reason we're here is to see if there's a way that we can find out what happened in Drakon hime vales whole plan is to restore the kingdom and I mean we just found the Queen all right I'm not happy about it but she can come with us for now for now friend she's not gonna tag along with us or our whole you know try it through the city you know thank you so much she's your responsibility she's my queen my lady I will help her last I checked we were a team so she's also your responsibility I know that's why I was against it anyway thanks Pluto back to the Queen and say would you like be judging Lee I guess we should ask the Queen if she wants come with us so we don't kidnap her as we continue to argue I turned back to the maidens again and I'm like we're gonna bring her somewhere safe and we're going to get her help they they look at each other they say safe where we have a tower oh yes we'll begin packing her things right away and the three of them turn they begin gathering up the muddy wet dresses and packing them into the trunks and gathering the things together and and Gertrude goes up and grabs the Queen's hands as your majesty these these champions they're they have the crest of the steward they're going to bring us to a safe place they've come for us they've come for us they're going to bring us back to the king and your children working on that yes and Gertrude turns to human and says master Johann he's found her children yes he's found the king well we don't know we're still trying to find the answers but her face turns sour and says but that's why we were waiting here he was supposed to bring them no but lots of things had happened since but our number one priority is to get the Queen to safety Oh we'll get the rest of the okay mysteries answered later like I said it's been some time since things get her things get the portraits I need some something to jazz up my tower we do need some redecorating yeah grab the portraits as they grab the portraits yeah this is for sure you guys are robbing robbery and kidnapping they begin to go through the table and you can see that there are several that's good it looks like there's several documents with your father's seal on them as well are they open yeah yes they are can I see those and I point to them they're from My Father for 15 years oh my good Gertrude passes it to you okay and I look at them and I read them through and I say these are from my father oh there's a note that says says on the outside of it if I'm not back by tomorrow open this letter I opened the letter and it says on the inside my queen the situation is very dire if I haven't returned wait here I will try to get a sense of where everyone is gone I don't know what's going to happen next there's no sign of your husband or your children but I will look in the castle for them yours faithfully master yuan I read this out loud to everybody and I look at you two and say we need to get inside that castle first things first Queen to the tower of course then I guess we need to call the hooded lanterns yes because I think they might be able to I I don't trust the hooded lanterns but I trust them most with the Queen I trust them with the Queen because they're here to restore Drakon home yes so that makes sense to me I don't know if they'll have the best resources to help her but I'm sure we can call in a couple favors maybe the fact that we have a queen could be a bargaining chip with them to just say hey like you should have some some of your troops stationed at your tower and that can be a place to protect and keep her yeah until we figure out a way into the castle yeah definitely okay any other letters for my father not asking your advice program I'm right here that's all I know okay and I take that letter and I put it in my bag so I want to keep it it's got my father's handwriting on it mementos and I say my queen we need to go we need to get you to safety okay it takes them a little while to get their things together they handmaidens seem insistent on bringing the Queen's things with her as long as they can carry I'll be doing that I'm putting more alder Julie's in Pluto yeah yeah I'm yeah we're filling up my bag now - I also we had now kind of go through some of her while they're kind of packing up I want to look around her personal effects most of its clothes and jewelry and several portraits and paintings of her children any-any what you can see is that within the paintings there are there you could recognize the figures and in the paintings what wasn't represented in the statues at side is that there's actually three children in the royal family but those statues were built before the third came along and the third the youngest Eliza was only a few years old so even if she was alive today she would still be a teenager the children otherwise depicted her are the the eldest of them are maybe only 15 or so years old the the other two Katarina and Leonard are depicted with their mother and one portrait all together any old family seals or the signs of there's a large box of makeup and you can see that yes there is a ring with the royal seal on it I'm gonna grab that ring okay do I see him grab that yeah yeah he's going through he's going for it yeah he's not being discreet about at all about what he's going through gluto what are you doing with that ring I could ask you the same thing about your ring that is not your ring I want to look at it no look at this ring hand over the ring this could help us get into the good castle Nando well you guys can steal a lady and all of her stuff and shoot her but I can't take one ring that's a significant ring situation Pluto Pluto you can have another ring okay so it's got the seal on it right does it have any like other discerning qualities it may have some magic to it interesting maybe this can get us into the castle I'm just fine yeah I'll give it to Sebastian okay you can hang on all this environment is inappropriate for a long rest you could take a short rest down here he's a chose to do so while they're packing yeah that could be nice I offer one hit day sir although you get to recover your exhaustion yeah yeah no not on a short not on a short rest it's not long rest old me uh long wrestling yeah that's nuts four hit points back I feel a tiny bit better but I still would like to go sleep somewhere yeah the look III want to level with you guys oh do you as you know there is some Caspian treasure that belongs to my people that has been lost in dragon I'm and it has been lost here for the last 15 years now I don't accuse the Queen of being a thief but as time has kind of been lost some things that are mine might be construed as hers for example if let's say you just had something in your house for a really long time and you think oh that's mine and you maybe forgot who lent it to you so when we find things that are owed to caspia they belong to me and as far as I'm concerned that ring starts to fall into that category this ring has the symbol of that's why I checked it that's I was examining it and if it's if it's deserved - tracking hime then so be it but you certainly it's easy to ask me I can't have the symbol of Dragon hi mom they could be easily changed there there's a there's a debt owed to caspia and it might also come in the form of rings and treasure and so Pluto if there are things that you think are I know not think I know aren't are Cassio's yep definitely let us know but when I know that there is a signet ring that will impart the seal of Dragon hime into lettering I know that is not per se which is transfer yet because the power is then moved over to dragon hime in order to impart information so you can have your dragon hime ring but you will have the dragon but you could take anything else that isn't dragon home hey where I thought we were a team I thought we talked about being a Team Blue tow we are a team and this is this is important why didn't you tell us that that's what you were up to yeah that's what I told you I told you guys a while ago you told us not a while ago but you don't have to be sneaking around and being all suspicious you can just say hey some of this treasure could belong to Caspian yeah is there a second you guys are kind of shadowing my I was pretty ruthless about my I was kicking over stuff and I found this friend like I wasn't like sneaking around and I also didn't shoot the Queen you loved her so much and you shot her and burned her eyes out she was also trying to burn our faces off exactly and now we're carrying her back to her hideout so let's be let's not point fingers well I have to keep us safe out here and it's I find that it's my duty I can't lose to the dungeons of Jack and I and I think you deserve what is owed to caspia I agree with that I believe if there is gold here that is meant to be cast and if that it's meant to be Caspian and if that treasure has been altered or changed or is lost to the ages then I will find my plunder and other value all right Pluto we've been adventuring together a little bit yeah we've lost your friends all of your friends I didn't really know them but they were good people they they were okay I feel like I feel like there's got to be a level of trust between us so here we go this ring symbol of Jack and I yeah does this belong to you probably not I'm just looking you wide-eyed behind do you like I thought you were gonna offer it I was like what are you doing I'm guys.i proving that there's trust here III thought that it was like you know collective you know ring taking like my rings are your rings but there are gonna be Caspian treasures that belong to me then take the ring but if it's if it's the Queen's ring and she wants it back you can like you can have the ring I don't care about the ring it has the seal tracker but I thought maybe we could use it to get into the castle we might be able to yeah I just didn't want you and it seems magic I think since I have this badge that lets us potentially get in if one of us keeps the ring as long as it's not used for ill means against dragon I'm that's my only concern mm-hmm I do trust you but I also know that with the ring significant like with this evil dragon hime that's a bit it's a bit person I'll be honest I'm not gonna run away with one ring like I need a lot more treasure to go back with I lost a lot like I can't just show up and be like I got one ring and like a few with all of that like I need I need buckets okay I can't I when I when I do my run away if there is gonna be a run away it's gonna be with like did you say wet if I'm just gonna run away with a bunch of treasure it's not gonna be with one ring it's gonna be with like mountains of gold so I never have to come back here I don't know I got it I gotta figure that out - it's a lot of logistics sounds very interesting I want to make my intentions perfectly clear I'm here to kill things and get treasure those are my two objectives in that order cool cool the ring itself is my wanted estimate and it is the as the seal of Queen Lenore it confers a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws whoever wears it and we just know that yeah you've taken your short rest and you can identify the properties during my short rest I instead of regaining a ton of health because I did not I'm examining the ring and finding this out a little bit oh you want to wear it you want to I mean you guys don't trust me so you can have it I I trust you put him do you want it now you can have the handmaidens also gather up much of the gold and the other offerings that have been left here as well and packed them into the trunks the three the three of them begin to haul the three large trunks filled with jewelry clothing paintings and gold up the stairs and they with they the two of them kind of look at look at the three of you and say we will must help the Queen walk you will each need to pull one of her luggage the Queen's luggage you weren't taking the luggage and we were taking the Queen the Queen is injured and delicate and we will carry her piggyback her it's fine would you like to pay you back we yeah okay yeah I was like how's that how's that strength good okay I'm gonna watch this I'm gonna watch I'm going to observe the and then seven so you try to lift the Queen the Queen up and she's she's very unsure of herself because she's blind now she says I can watch she takes your hand she says I can walk just leave me okay wait I put her hand around my arm and just say I will lead you my queen and we lead her up the handmaidens have also put the veil back over her face yeah that's good I also had we're just gonna cover that up this is a big cover-up isn't it this is a huge cover-up I grab some luggage and start yeah I'm gonna I guess all okay Can I grab two luggages then yeah you can kind of haul like it's big suitcases yeah I'm stuck carry two I'm like I'm all grumpy like on a Christmas like he's crumbling away behind everyone that said you got that you got the suitcase that has a bunch of the jewelry in it you'll probably have to go give that a look over some of that might be Caspian yeah I'm gonna do a thorough search when we get back to the town yeah so in the time that you spent resting the handmaidens have seen to the Queen her wounds they've been able to dress dress her wounds she's very much in shock as any would be with what just happened to her but they're able to help her her walkabout and with with Vale and Gertrude kind of guiding her forward you're able to move but very slowly as you walk through through Queens Park garden they how are you gonna move this grip you've these these whatever abilities these hand maidens have developed they seem like they're not aware of what they're capable of doing I mean let's say on the paths cause it's a bit clearer we just need to be slower and maybe be alert if there's any more gnomes that are gonna come to use in the base I'm so tired I'm dragging all this luggage and I am i loud my face is all burned and stuff all grumpy grumpy Pluto I'm I'm carrying one piece of luggage but I'm also I'm like looking at everything that moves okay ready with my magic I also as much as I'm leading the Queen I also do take out a crossbow and just kind of hold it in my hand and I'm kind of looking around but I'm leading the charge okay so you're heading towards your Tower great you head back through Queens Park Gardens it is now the mid-afternoon and they the haze has come in thick so you head through the fog of the guy that surrounds the garden this eerie landscape dragging along the luggage it's the sound of it dragging through the mud of the park echoing out across the trees and across the parkway it is sometime but you reach the edge of the park without too much trouble as you reach the edge of the park the handmaidens stop her a moment and they look at you all and they say are you taking us out of the park yes I thought that was obvious we haven't left the park and so long I thought you thought it was yesterday yeah it's like it's been a good day their sense of time is okay are you not familiar with the streets of Drakon time we remember the city like it was yesterday don't worry they seemed a little afraid and hesitant to leave the garden we are not going back as I put it what's the holdup we've fought our way through the streets of Drakon hime a couple times now it's safer where we're taking you make a persuasion check 25 okay they nod and you leave Queens Park garden and as Gertrude steps out of the garden as she steps forward the just as before when she pulled herself into the mud her face strips away she continues to step forward as if nothing's happened and her flesh strips away like vines almost and the strand is almost stuck in the garden and as she continues to walk forward she collapses forward and disintegrates into dust huh the as she does this the other hand maidens have done the same and the three of them are not but dust the Queen is fine well you might need to hire some new handmaiden and Queen just thought you should know um I'm a bit like freaked out I was like that's not what I was expecting and this is just more magic from Sebastian what you do to this why did you do to Gertrude I won't lie I had like a I was weighing options in my head and I felt like there was a 15% chance that this could happen I thought I'd gamble on that and looks like I lost I'm wondering if they were just too far gone from the magic and the Queen at least we've got her out in time where she's not totally subset I mean I'm really sorry that you lost somebody who grew up with but I think she was already lost yeah if she's gonna disintegrate if she relieves the pardon me should have told them to stay anyway what's gonna be this ago the the hard question is who's gonna carry this stuff that they were carrying there Gary what are they carrying stuff they were helping to carry the Queen okay thank gosh alright let's continue towards my tower quickly as quickly as we can let's bring up the map real quick I like how unfazed they disintegrate it's just like oh no she's gonna be mad time anymore okay they should didn't see it happen so you're a--they at you're at the south part of Queens Parramatta reduce so it would be you could head directly south to Market Square and then back across the market to the to the clock tower in fact from here you can see a the clock tower looming in the distance and I I describe it to the Queen to let her know where we're going so that way she understands where we are in the city can you fluff it up a bit everything's normal everything's it's beautiful clock tower the buildings are men there's sign beside wonderful day in Drakon okay I mean the Sun can we do like a little it's like hello good sir no I don't need any bread today we put on a little play for the Queen we start like making market noises we create an ambience of of market noises so she feels as you head along the street Queen from the garden to the market you come to a crossroads though you are you taking point with the Queen yeah okay how are you gonna lead this group through because the queen is not capable of your group is even though you got a short distance to go it's still potentially a dangerous one so how are you delete them through when they about all this luggage and the Queen leave the Queen's luggage keep the portraits drop the luggage can yeah so how is it divvied cuz I I thought it was like clothes and portraits and jewelry clothes jewelry portraits and other knickknacks it's like two two trunks of clothes and jewelry and one trunk of other things including the portraits we take like a quick couple minutes and throw the clothes out and just combine the portraits and jewelry into one bag absolutely how much time you wanna spend let's find some cover let's go into one of these abandoned houses and we'll spend we'll do this like super fast just toss out everything that looks invaluable and toss everything that looks valuable she might need bag I mean I I don't want her here but we should probably keep one set of clothes clothes not pretty disgusting I wasn't at her new clothes okay and I just that was a $5,000 couch I'm just like they're just taking a bathroom break can all Romeo D six two six four okay you spend the time rearrange the trunks and what do you keep you keep the jewelry in the paintings jeweler in paintings okay you proceed into the Market Square from there yes yes yeah but I don't say into markets where I want to stay around the edge okay okay you said because of the monster that's it slaughter stone square oh yeah no open spaces like I want to stay close to the buildings and like if there's any place it if something happens that we can put the Queen inside a building okay I want to stake as close as possible so am i carrying the Queen so all the luggage though right yeah you don't bag of valuable luggage oh and that's it yeah nice yeah I know maybe you all get you to go in the front and I can direct you where we're going okay okay alrighty so you head across Market Square back towards the clock tower it's difficult and slow going but you're able to lead Lenoir carefully through the side streets until you reach the edge of the the edge of the clock tower as you come towards the clock tower you can see that the front doors have been burst open oh did we leave those doors open nope no we we used we like barred them shut didn't we yeah the clock tower stands with a great planar clock still still with this with a timepiece stuck between pandemonium and limbo the front steps and the barricade that you've created are scattered out across the front as if someone broke through it from the outside I think milady you should stay here for a moment Fudo and I should scout ahead see I'll stay by the door just pork chops if you need me pork chops okay and create a base camp thank you my good side and I want to peer in and go into the Clocktower okay are you going to approach your stay here okay give me a stealth check natural one which is eight okay as you come up along the way and push yourself towards the door you catch sight of several figures in the base of a clock tower there dagger is drawn it is a group of the Queen's men for jobs before we dive into the ruins again a big

just as a real quick reminder this is our last session for 2018 we will be coming back in January 2019 after a couple weeks break for the holidays but when we come back on in January our first session back will be on January 14th which is the Monday instead of January 15th the Tuesday will be playing on Monday the 14th and Monday the 21st in January and then be back to a regular schedule on Tuesdays that's just because I've had a few work things come up on my end and there's no way for me to get out of them so in order for us to let the game continue we got to move to Monday for just those two weeks but then we'll be back back to normal after that now before the break our heroes had successfully managed to blind and effectively incapacitate Queen Lenore and kidnap Queen Lenore from her hideout in Queens Park grotto bringing her back through the city towards the clock tower you have stumbled upon a home invasion the front doors of the clock tower have been knocked down the barricade that you set up blown past and vayo as you step up the steps you can see that there are a motley collection of Queen's men including a familiar looking pair of halflings and a dwarf sitting around a campfire playing cards as if they are waiting for you as you come up the steps you stumble on a stone and it crackles down the stairs and the dwarf speaks up and says I heard that what was that sounds like someone's coming what are you going to do I'm just gonna did you yell out pork chops behind Brad some pork chops that's what I am and that triggers me to immediately run I was next to the door and so I turn in and kind of now right behind you and I also yell pork chops pork chops Pluto what are you gonna do I'm going to stand up from the my luggage I made like a little like sitting area for me in the Queen and we're just waiting patiently so I stand up at attention and I and she's sitting on the luggage just kind of like don't don't do anything anything just don't just stay here is it dinner time yes I'll come back don't eat pork we'll figure out your restrictive diet in a moment okay what are you guys gonna do you've you've charged up you see they're they're coming to their feet and they can they no veo is there and as you're rushing up the steps you can see that in the base of the clock tower there are now a group of Queens men including the two halflings and the dwarf that it previously escaped you along with three new compact reott s-- all of them have their their hoods drawn up and red face masks over their faces and they have their their band and like their bandanas are pulled up over their faces like they're ready to do some business and as you run up the steps they draw their blades and their crossbows and they look like they're ready for a fight what are you gonna do get ready for a fight I guess unless I I feel I feel like I'm done talking to these guys especially since it's the same ones that tried to kill us in the bar and where else did they try to kill us on the road yeah how do they how do they know to find us here or are they just chillin I do you say that from like down the staff how did they know to find us here and I hear you and I turn back I'm like how did you know to find us here the dwarf in the centre laughs and says there's a couple holes in the hoods if you catch my drift so they go did not good hoods it's not all good in the hood you've given us enough trouble the dwarf says if you come quietly before the Queen you can plead your case otherwise we'll have your gizzards if you leave quietly and don't bother us you'll keep your lives you can ask those two small ones over there about the last two times they encountered us we don't leave many mouths to speak we did leave a few many we don't suppose to actually make an intimidation check yeah yeah 28 they were not prepared for that kind of threat they said we've been waiting for this boys give him your best and we hit a roll for initiative what did the intimidation check accomplish you may roll your initiative all three of you with advantage Oh worth there it is what do we got I got a 22 21 I got a 19 that advantage that it did my so sorry sales again I'm 22 21 19 we were ready this time no survivors I'm tired of answering to Queens I've been doing the work for Queens like these guys are the want me to talk to their queen I got to carry the luggage for that other Queen I'm tired I'm dying this I'm starting to break down this royal system and go back to a simpler time all right so these Queens men bandits you have shaken them in their boots Sebastian and so you can please yourselves all outside the front doors of the clock tower great and Sebastian you are the first act all right so as soon as they look like they're about to attack Sebastian runs forward okay Sebastian as you run forward give me one perception check that's that's a one okay you do not see the tripwire that they've left across the doorway the doorway and as you come across the the tripwire the quite suddenly you hear this loud snapping sound as a pair of crossbows set to the either side of the door fire and hit you it's fine everything's fine they get a 16 and a 15 to hit uh as soon as I hear the wire trip I raise up my hand and cast shield okay so you raise up your hand you cash shield blocking the crossbow bolts as they stab into your side's and they are deflected it is so without even skipping a beat I just walk I tripped the wire I hear it I stop the bolts and then I look at them and I say time to give you the old razzle-dazzle and I cast hypnotic pattern and my eyes turned black as this stream of Shadows comes out of me and starts to turn into shadowy snakes that kind of coalesce in the air and move in and out of each other in a very hypnotic pattern okay so make the saves what's the saving Thoreau TC 16 16 okay so Farley fails one of the halflings succeeds cat but the other half link fails so the the female cat halfling Cassy she's failed or she succeeded and the other half things have failed okay okay and then there's the three other Queens then oh my god of the three others though so the ones that have failed are the male halfling the the dwarf the male halfling the three in the back all failed the three in the front all succeeded yeah if you have a marker we can use them there we go you want to mark the ones that are effect yet right yeah okay so that you kind of conjure the the symbol in the in their midst the other half like not that that one yeah you conjured the symbol in their midst and the three in the front are so focused toward you that they kind of move their eyes past it and they fix their gaze on you as the crossbow bolts shot up the other three in the back they'll are completely hypnotized to it and stand there drooling you guys know what to do Vail you're up and I turn my gaze towards that are there halfling I say you should know by now you really take the cake here bud and I turn my crossbow towards him or not crossbow sorry my long ago and I'm gonna take my three shots I just wanna cover did you say you should have known by now there's a difference between gnomes and a half I know and it's like kinda Dobby takes it personally you should have known by now okay so my first one that's what I thought you said so I really want to add drinking that's a hit boom oh whatever it is it's dead thirty damage so you as you come up the steps you lower your your longbow fire the arrow straight forward and it strikes this small halfling right between the eyes and goes right through her her head and out the other side sending brain matter splattering all across the floor I'm just like so pissed that this halfling came back again hopefully you learned his lesson I had a chance gentleman right in the middle okay and that's a sixteen hit that's a hit twenty damage so that strikes him soundly just above the collarbone and he cries out he's bloodied but still alive I'm gonna take another shot at him oh yeah fourteen to hit it narrowly deflects off of his his armor okay and then I go back towards the Queen some like Pluto you're up Bluto I let out a Caspian war cry I'm gonna murder you and I run into the room and as I run into the room I do like a quick examination and I see that one guy is like holding his shoulder and I'm like and I just point at him and I run at him and I go to stab him with my spear okay is your electrical spear was javelin Herman 21:21 you catch him in the neck with the spear he has two stops you catch him in the neck with the spirit I'm entrusting it straight forward and it severs off half of his neck and he slumps slumps to the ground very dead and then I just and I just spin and I look at the other guy and I pointed him again with my shield and I just okay go for it 14 and it's a narrow miss as he slides out of the way of the hit but I'm gonna use my bonus action to slam him onto the ground go for it 17 he's knocked to the are you knocking him back her knocking him down down okay you knock him down and I stand over him he scrambles to his feet spending his cunning action to try to disengage oh man and he stands up tries to rush to lunge towards the door where Sebastian is screaming wildly so I get to swing because you have Sentinel right and I get a 25 to hit and so he's gonna take 11 damage at blood ease him and and that stops him stops this movement so get him in the back so he tries to scramble to his feet and you basically ham straight like hit him in the hamstrings and he stumbles forward as he tries to run and he just looks up right in front of Sebastian with a look of utter horror like this was the worst mistake he's ever made probably the last mistake he's ever made Sebastian what do you do oh I'll just point a finger gun at him and be like my name is Sebastian Crowe and I'm about to set you on fire and then I fire a fire bolt Adam cool Drive disadvantage because he's no he's not thrown any more he's not prone right but you can just roll the shot regular 12 you miss Sebastian he's tripping so like yeah so he trips forward and the and the and the bolt sails right through where his head would have been as he as he kind of flounders forward and then flounders back to his feet I feel like I look up and Pluto looks at me and I'm just like warning warning shot and I just shake my head and bam I peek my head out see this happening and I just go okay and I take my long bow and I take a shot thirteen sails past him as well and so he's just dodged as he pushes him out over the way from the fire bolt pushes himself past that he dodges both the shots and is scrambling to his feet to try to get away from pollute Oh hoo it's Polly those terrible moving away from it maybe yeah you would have got my shots so we both made a move out of the way I say too much just a standstill knave and I get a twenty seventy yeah it's a hit for another 11 damage you sliced down his back severing his spine and he drops to the floor dead and and I'm gonna turn to the other little halfling and I'm just gonna walk up to him and and and wait for my comrades we're gonna do the old I do the null thing again but this time we're gonna be much more prepared are we I don't know I don't know let's find out remember no point blaming I'm just gonna I gotta stay by the entrance cuz I've got a range shot anyways and cuz I always still want to keep an eye out for the Queen okay she said I'm going to I'm going to use the help action and I wanna I want to position it so I want to just give veo a target okay so I want to hold the halfling like gently keeping it in hypnotic about him but just stand there and just like holy show this like hey oh wait I'm like doing like the take the shot with advantage I got 24 okay get your 19 damage there's no way he's gonna survive this no no he doesn't execution style like then that end are you guys going to repeat this for the other two you want to get a shot in do they lose their hypnotic pattern at all no because as long as Sebastian concentrates on it so at this stage you want to execute they're all the remainder of them is that what you want to do maybe let's keep the dwarf can we at least shoot him in the knees yeah you poked your head like can we shoot him in the knees yeah running away okay okay you guys have the door so we we shoot him in both of his knees and and tie him up actually first we time to this pillar literally okay shoot and grab one of their crossbows and I take both of them at the same time so that way I'm not having to do it twice that's about of the hypnotic pattern he looks down in horror and what has happened to his knees and I go back to the Queen like you guys interrogate good evening is it evening it's he's like he says I've had better days look you're a thief and you're a lowlife and you're scum and the only reason you're still alive is because vo there is looking after the Queen and she's not shooting you more so you you have one chance to talk and tell us why are you here Queen's orders mum sent here to try to bring you in or kill ya who's the Queen none either the queen of thieves herself she took the Senate sentence told her to bring you in to stand trial at her core for crimes against the gang yep what's her name she's just the queen of Thieves how did she know we were here little bird told her she knows lots you mentioned there were holes in the hooded lanterns can you give us some names tell us who the mole is couldn't tell you couldn't tell you exactly who they keep that pretty tight-lipped all I know is that one of their boys has a thing for one of our ladies I think I know who that is thank you that's very helpful Jan why should we keep you alive we found out last time we were at the hooded lanterns I the the really annoying guy yeah there was some talk about him some girl dumped him from or something he was yeah so I'm putting this together here why should we keep you alive listen I I told you what you wanted to know you wrecked my legs but if you wanted to try to talk the Queen out of it I could show you where she hides out you could point to it on this map yeah but I won't tell you the password till you take me there I'm not dragging him all the way there all right yeah I guess he's do we like do we hurt him Pluto what what when he's you when he's all used up we give him a prisoner's death and right now it looks like you're all used up make an intimidation check 11 he says listen listen I'm a dwarf or my word don't off me I'll tell I'll I'll let you in I'll get you in there but thank you just gonna trust anybody they know that you know they know who you are everybody in the gangs know it knows to watch out for you they'll see you coming a mile away have you ever been on fire before cuz I don't feel a lot of trust here I have a tendency to set people on fire that I don't trust right now he's not trust in you right now I'm not it seems like it's bad group huddle trial yeah talk to my muscle over here yeah she's outside just one moment sir dwarf we're gonna do it yeah group huddle by the door time around the she's tied up yeah he's tied up and he's crippled horribly I think um yeah I think it's a trap that being said I would love to know how they got this far into Jack and I'm with the Hayes like how are they surviving I mean it's probably a trap but is it a trap that we can leverage also we have a lot going on right now we have the Queen we have to alert the hooded lanterns the other question is do we have time to deal with this or should we just keep killing them you're you're intense we because okay sir he makes you intense sorry some of the options we have are we could let him go we could have him as a prisoner and take us to where he says the Queen's hideout is or the Queen's place and he says he'll let us know the password right or we murder him or is there any other am I missing something if we do keep him as a prisoner who's gonna lead us to the Queen's men I still don't trust him so we shot him in the legs should we take his hands we could also like disarm him and literally or we could cut out his tongues we can't talk we can he needs to give us a password this is getting uh I mean I'm not much of a torturer I kind of just kill people who need to be yeah I mean I I I'll give him a prisoners death which is execution yeah that being said the password these are dime a dozen as we see or maybe we send him back with a message mhm cuz they already know we're here but he also knows we have the Queen does he he will yeah he would I must be Highness the Queen I don't want the Queen no in the Queen's oh man honestly like it's too bad you have to die like we we tried to save you but yeah we don't really have time for you right now yeah you're just you came at a bad time yeah man I hate to break it to you but we did the huddle and he screams and begs says you off him yeah hmm but a like a proper yeah like no no yeah nobody didn't want to die they just could stop coming after us obviously we're killing enough of them that we gave them the option to leave they didn't I mean he did give us some information we now know just Darwin is - researching we know that there's a mole in the hood yes we have a very good idea who that might be yeah you have an ID yeah you know who so we might need to have a private conversation with what's his name searching the bodies are we able to find any other sort of tokens or or or please tell me yes I guess right Matt yeah yeah did he leave his Wi-Fi password written down they they have very little else on them both of them have a few gold pieces but the only thing on them though are each of them is carrying a set of keys I you we should be the key master do the keys all look similar each of them has on their person ace eye one of them the dwarf has three keys on a ring and then across the others is a across the other group of them is another set of identical keys but they've been split off across the group I take one set of the keys describe all the keys yeah well yeah well who wants and the others oh I can carry the other set okay I'm thinking that maybe we should take their masks as well look across our face a bone each just in case sure okay yeah and and I think I did collect armbands before but I can update them if need be grab the most recent armbands because this will be this could be our disguise in yeah I said that we could be they might know us but we can we can change our appearance and he didn't tell us where the Queen's men are but honestly we have so much on our hands right now I mean really killing him was more just because we either let him go or try to add another thing to our plate where we have the Queen sitting right outside and I think right now we need to take care of the Queen before we start worrying about these Queen's men we have an apology that as much as I trusted I trust certain lanterns to do the best I'm wondering is he the only spy I I think that we should send a pigeon to Petra specifically okay but then is she only talking to her father yeah can I ask who do who do we trust among the lanterns how do we know that the mole is not Petra or her brother where do we send it right to the commander where do we keep this kind of to are so we can seal a seal dragon I'm maybe the message that we need to send to the commander is we have uncovered a mole within the hooded lanterns I feel like I still trust Petra yeah I trust Petra so I think that we should send word to the commander tell him a mole has been found in the hooded lanterns we trust Petra we and like explained we have the Queen we need I wouldn't even put that in a letter I have a question so what's your next move we need to get her upstairs you know bring the Queen up and set her up here in the tower yeah and then where what is your next step after that we want to let I mean our goal was to let the hooded Lantern's know of the situation although now that's become trickier yeah we also wanted we have the lilies we need to go see Oscar yeah but one thing at a time we need to secure the Queen yeah what are we gonna do we're just gonna leave the Queen well in your Tower here with us oh that I knew this was gonna happen I'm gonna be carrying the freakin queen dragon I'm around my back I wanted to leave her at the park it would just be slow I still think I still think that the hooded lanterns watch her until they know about this place we've given them permission to use this place without giving too much information we need to let the commander know that we need support y-yeah but we need to hint at the fact not to include Petra's brother in this yeah yeah also I guess right now I guess phase two information we can safely say that because the Queen's men know that we're here and she's really mad at us for killing all our henchmen and stuff it's not safe to leave the Queen here I hate that I hate that we could have and the her handmaidens are all melted yeah but is what are we trying to do for the Queen are we just trying to get her into the hands to be protected or do we trust the hooded lanterns I'm now not trusting that I trust certain people I don't trust how far the reaching is of especially if it's a higher up in the command that has the power to relay that information to the Queen like yeah I don't like that what about Oscar I'd rather get her looked at why would we trust an Oscar that's what you leave her with Oscar no but what if we took her to Oscar with the lilies maybe Oscar could look I don't know if I trust Oscar Oscar either but I can't we can't leave her here anymore because well I mean like either way I could use a rest and I say that we go to the top of the clock tower and like okay and her wounds I still think that we send a message the question is do we trust the commander of the hooded lanterns is that who we want to send a message to or is there somebody else that you guys think we should search are the commander either what about river because River obviously liked the quick and then she had and your your mother had a connection with River you guys gotta go my mother had a current connection with the river no no she was just a clock tower let's let's discuss this on the way up we first start to get the queen up there and sure yeah so I grapple hook shot up to the second level and I let down did we do a rope ladder or just a rope I think just tie off the rope every time okay yeah so if you go up there and it's it's easy enough to help the Queen get up into the clock tower it takes a bit of work to kind of you have to really secure her to kind of like a swing loop on like make a loop on the bottom of the rope and have someone else pull it up but once you do that you can get her up she requires a lot of help getting up the ladders and everything because she is blind now but you're able to bring her up the other probably part of that of getting her all the way up there is that she's still wearing this dress do I forget luggage when she do get up do I have any spare clothes yeah you can you can dress her and her reflux of having someone else dress her is on point and so even though she doesn't know what you're putting on her she's like I hope you're putting something nice on me yeah she's okay with that and for a moment she she becomes lucid for like a very brief moment as you dress her and she says oh hey oh I always thought you were such a pretty pussycat I always would have loved to have had you as one of my mates you were a bit of a brat though your father used to say he had to apologize for you she and you can see like she can't see but it's almost like she doesn't have the focus that if she could she wouldn't anyways she's kind of lost a lot of her own identity and whatever's happened here and as she reminisces she asks where did he go my father where did master Johann go those are the answers I'd like to find out myself my lady did he find my children I'm sure he did but if he did he hasn't returned with them he promised me that he'd find them he said that he would he said I'd be safe there he said he'd go and find them a lot has happened in these years m'lady that has caused a lot of our plans to change but I'm sure that if he did find them he wouldn't bring them back because it's very dangerous in the city this is the only safe spot left so many things have happened and then and she just sighs out on that word and is silent at that point although when she said I was a pretty cat I was like yeah I am a pretty kid I'm really excited that she she complimented me but at the same time I'm like I'm not surprised that my father ought to apologize for me I was a little [ __ ] all right bad influence sorry wait who was the little help guys I'm trying to like your sister like she's talking I'm standing back kind of like watching this whole thing being being like this is cool and then I look behind me and you're just like climbing up the last rope carrying the luggage and then like I'm definitely striking I do put her up in my bed as well just to make sure she can like lay down and I go to find my pigeons where are you guys cool well and is that where you want to pass the night and take a long rest okay I do want to send out the message before we sleep of course with I think some watches just to make sure the Queen doesn't stay us and go crazy yeah we can keep watch do we want to send one of your pigeons out to spy on the Paladin army as well yeah I do so I'm going to send I think you sent them out already to spy on the army but you want to send them out again - yeah watch over okay I want to take it like another loop and just tell them like to come back um hopefully about the morning before we head out if not to keep watch until I come back to the tower actually let me see it from here you can it doesn't look like the the paladin's have mobilized from their camp yet so they're still yeah okay then I mean we I guess you don't have to you then you don't need to send them out just in case because they can always again do swoops and come back and super come back oh can I generally keep an eye out but I'm gonna send pesto to check out the army of the paladins and then I send Bobby he's my most trusted to the commander I'm I said into the commander so I wrote write a message general details about what we found not telling him about the Queen but we've found something of importance to the monarchy of Dragon home do you also let him know that like there's a possible mole yeah be very careful and who can trust specifically we trust Petra yeah do we say that we don't trust the brother or like I'd I say the only ones we trust solely right now are you and Petra and that is trusting you with our lives so don't let us down and I'm yeah and then also I do want to use the signet ring to like make it like a like I actually I don't have any wax so what I do is I just kind of take some dirt and I'll I kind of smudge it yeah you can make an ink or you guys actually we use the signet ring to imprint the letter with a bit of Dragon hi-yah okay and I do also offer the Queen some of my my last bit of my candied Sam and that I have because she doesn't like work um she goes to eat and she says oh it tastes like ash I mean you're welcome your majesty can I can i I want to give the the Queen a a monster doctor evaluation okay monster so like what I know about monsters and conditions and afflictions I want to kind of give her a once-over and just see her overall like based on her symptoms what she's telling me I'm turning on doctor doctor Pluto sure because I still have concerns that she's yeah you could either give me a medicine or an hour an Arcana check medicine do you want it you want to be my my assistant your nurse yeah nurse nurse - yes - there's some question if the two of you want to assess her together one of you can roll with advantage on either Arcana or medicine I don't care which of you roles if you're working together you want me yeah but if the two of you kind of work together and discuss back and forth what you see yeah so I'm gonna do like the physical examination you're doing the magical examination now that we're kind of rested and 17 okay this is a powerful affliction that grips her the there is delirium embedded in her body and it is affecting her in a dramatic way it's possible looking at her and even as the night passes looking at her condition in the morning it's possible that the haze is affecting her inversely so her life might be dependent on exposure to the haze now is it like is her condition worsened now that she's out of the haze at the top of the tower yeah she is she's sickly the the the bits of hair are like coiled like hair that she had are like dying and falling off and she has has started to turn pale and almost corpse-like in her inner power she still has some vigor to her but this but what's happening is really is really clearly the like the universe of what someone who is exposed to the haze for a long term and what happens to them what happens if I give her a small piece of delirium to hang on to if you put the delirium in her hands like she can hold it hard just fine yeah you can but does she get a bit better he put the delirium in her hand and you can see it's like the flesh around her begins to like pull itself back together and she holds the Delirium close to her and as she holds it holds the delirium he's close in she just opens her eyes and her eyes have regenerated and she opens her hand and the shard is gone hiyee is she have weird eyes or normalised she is weird she's weird eyes look away I say Queen Lenore please close your eyes she looks and she says i where am i where have you taken me where where are my handmaidens what have you done close your eyes and I show to her she know how dare you order me around um and you can feel that she's trying to like summon up this energy yeah once more but it's like there's not enough of it in her and she faints all right let's not give her any more delirium yeah this is what happens when you have too much to lyrium do you want to become that no yeah bad delirium bad I get that I just drink it it's fine so she fainted I think we need to get her to Oscar I we've already sent a message to the hooded lanterns I'm hoping that they respond and/or are here shortly have we taken a long rest or are we yes okay my I think also I have to pull military rank she's a danger to herself and us we need to keep she's our prisoner she is not the Queen well we should tie her up if we're gonna move her she's not blind anymore this is a little uh she's our she's our I mean we did kidnap her like I think I'm an accessory at this point I think she can see doesn't mean we can't blindfold her do her eyes stay like even if she's out of the haze her eyes are now there yeah the delay or the piece of delirium was like absorbed into what about you when you turn her turn her hand around you can see it's now embedded in her hand and whatever whatever's happened to it it regenerated her like restored her vigor but not enough that she could conjure up her powers again I mean I'm glad that we sent a message to the hooded lanterns what I'm starting to think that saving the Queen if that is something that is possible might be beyond them yeah I agree I would put it to River or Oscar of the people that we know and not that I trust Oscar but he's probably the most advanced in the study of delirium and people and plus we have to drop off like a thousand things yeah I say we let's leave now and get her there and I and I don't mean any disrespect to your queen but I don't think this is your queen right now that is a long walk through a dangerous city I can knock her out I mean like airier I I walked in the window and I look out for any side she likes of hooded lanterns coming towards the tower yeah no there they might have received your message but if they're but you didn't ask them to come to the tower the other thing is is that as we move her we're gonna be moving her through the haze and I have a feeling that she's gonna slowly get her strength back so whatever we do we must move quickly and efficiently okay either I think either keeping her out of the haze completely or while we move her through it no guys here's the problem we you're suggesting bringing her to Oscar yeah let's pull out the map again yeah Oscar is at seven on your map yeah a read manner yeah yeah I also market market gate is as far as we know monster infested you don't know what monsters we just know that it's inhabited by monsters yeah you guys are right I don't know if but the only advantage I guess of leaving the gate or leaving track and I would be that potentially the haze won't affect her but she might need the haze to live the choices there's still the hooded Lantern's who reside at the edge of the haze the haze does extend outside the city limits is just thicker inside the city I mean if it's enough to keep her alive but not enough to give her evil powers sneak her out where the rat people prudes summon him how do ya we never discussed that his summon him we find him in the rat's nest yeah yeah so if you want to take her out of the city aside from knocking over a gate yourself or taking her through the hooded Lantern's gate possibly in disguise there or bringing her down to champions gate I got an idea what's your idea we Jam her in her own suitcase we'll be like I've seen contortionists do it it's just like he's gotta be gonna do weird things with their eyes she's something but I vote we just jammer in the suitcase and I carry the suitcase they're gonna inspect it I mean we've been pretty good so far with the whole flashy flashy bad you badgy to fight your way through market gate or find another route of the city sewers lead us out where if you were to take the sewers through slaughter stone square the only sewer entrance that you know of we can't do that we can't bring the Queen the slaughter stone square from the corpse thing like she's first corpse that it gets I'll be I'll be totally transparent so we either have to fight our way through a gate trust the hooded lanterns who we already know they have a spy but here's the thing the spy in the hooded lanterns is reporting to the queen of Thieves yeah guys what why does that mean that they can't protect the Queen because the the queen of Thieves does not want the royal to coming back she was yeah and if she got leverage like what if she got a way to like they could steal her in the night and then she could have that as leverage to make the hooded lanterns maybe I'm overthinking it but no I mean that is a point and then are they gonna be really able to help the Queen like probably yeah they bury their can barely help themselves take her there the other they might take her off our hands guy never let us this is why we put a bunch of treasure in the bag on top of her and and and when they go what's the bag we got some treasure but here's your 20% we give them the 20% they they go on their way we go on our way River only shows up when she has work for us right I can't I can't like request her presence you've got no way to contact her which is far outside of the Hayes this is complicated I am I brought this on yourself my vote is we politely finesse the Queen into a bag cover her with treasure get another other bags full of treasure distract have you ever been in a bag full of treasure cuz I have and was it great pretty great yeah so that's what we're gonna do the Queen no it's not it's I mean if you have a better idea guys I think it's a great idea it's a big bag right just to it could be you'd have to find one okay so here's my thought we're really close to the river right now and I know Styx isn't around as fairies way out but what if we leave by the river if we can find a boat load us on we can just float and that will bring us where do you want to go that we could go to ember wood we could go to ember wood I know that you can't leave the haze for very long but River haze or chance of delirium we do have delirium on us I can say though that I I did make some assumptions like or do we know that yeah they give it as long as she's out of the hey she starts to deteriorate right yeah but that's why I said we have lots of delirium we could break off small chunks and only like feet or little bits I'll put a couple in the suitcase with her oh we're not putting your suitcase okay I think that's our best if we get her to Everwood village and River can help us River might be able to help us because River has seemingly dealt with delirium as well the amethyst Academy has created aqua delirium yeah I trust them more than I trust the hood lanterns only because I think they can help her more and then we can discuss it with the lanterns one once we figured out how to how if there is a possible way to save the queen yeah then the hooded lanterns can no more there's no point getting their hopes up like my hopes are up now to be fair to we've also told River that we're gonna show up with the the potion of testing on of Hayes I think this takes precedence yeah we have to we have to do something with the Queen and we can't just leave her in the city listen we can drop her off at the river and then go see Oscar and say by the way I just I think that's a long way to go around when we can just travel with her fine up Market Street I mean we fought with the Queen now we can fight again I I just thought I can just jam her in a bag I don't know why that's such a great bad idea how big is an excerpt a jammer and a bag you could simply try disguising her or that I guess I never thought I could disguise our and put the masks on her from our play I mean you have her in cat clothing yeah yeah she's not wearing fancy she could be me and then I could disguise myself yeah or maybe she we what is what is your story though issue a refugee because the hooded lanterns they're gonna ask questions I'm wondering if we just take a somebody who got caught or maybe it was one of the falling fire oh the cult oh yeah they don't like them word called the fanatics the followers of the following followers that's a nice safe word yeah the followers of the fire maybe do we have any garb from them you could very easily assemble something convincing okay the clothing that they owe has a and she's delirious enough that she probably won't say anything too crazy yeah thank you okay so are we back to heading to the hood lanterns yes but not telling them that that's the queen hooded lanterns gate you know what go to Oscar we can if he asked about our letter we can always just shown the signet ring and say this is what we found that pertains to the family and all right let's get ready to we got to give some treasure I'll give some treasure sure I mean we didn't find any treasure though other than the ring no we found oh that they'll know that's the Queen stuff yeah so we might have to part with some of our you leave some of it here and then bring a little bit to do kind of I'm just hoping to distract them with money so they don't ask questions okay okay so you head towards Shepherds gate how good is the disguise we'll find out you've clad the but what do you want to disguise her with tell me like what I mean I would say like bears clothes she the only thing is she refuses to take off her necklace yeah we put like scarfs and okay what's it called Afghan the one that wraps around you like nine times or in your neck yeah yeah it's like a napkin and and we do like a hood wrap and stuff and really try to cover her face okay and in her eyes because she has creepy eyes so like really get the hood over okay I mean because I don't want her gazing at us at all and she's just us she when you go to wrap her eyes up she says no no I want to see I want to see I thought I would never see again you'll see more after we take it off persuasion j9 she says no no I want to see anybody else want to try this I'll let her see what's the worst that could happen okay no yeah as she comes out and she looks over from the balcony of the clock tower she looks out over the city she says what's happened to my city well give me your fell and the energy emanating from where that meteor fell has been slowly destroying the city she kind of looks at herself something's wrong with me isn't there yeah we're working on fixing that you're you're really sick but we have someone that can help you how how long have I been like this I feel like I've been sleeping 15 years where are my children we're working on that as well we don't know but we're trying to we're trying to find your family you have to let us help you or else you'll never see your family again and I know you don't want that and there are dark forces at work so you need to kind of lay low on the whole royalty thing which is why we really really really want you to wear this headband your guards are not what they used to be and we're afraid that somebody may cause you harm in that group so until we can find out who we can trust from them this is why we need to keep you covered and keep you on the DL please milady yes yes if this is what must be done I I will I'll do it okay great loanwords so we dress her up and so she lets us our prize yep okay wrap her eyes and I say don't worry milady I will lead you to safety and we lead her towards the gate okay you head across Market Square the morning haze hanging over it past the sea of destruction and corpses and the Queen Lenore says what's happened to my city as she walks through the air unable to see she starts to ask a few more questions as you walk across the city wanting to know what's happened where she been she seems like she's coming toward coming to the realization of where she's been for the past 15 years as you head back down Sheppard's way towards the fortress of the hooded lanterns the horns ring again and the hooded lanterns come up from the inside and this time it is Petra and her brother Ansem on watch the two of them come out they say another successful sortie who's this that you've got in tow Petra says just somebody that we found alive actually a prisoner of some bandits he found someone alive in the ruins there's lots of you she okay what's happened to her she's she's all right she just were taking her back to amberwood village and she from the village yes she has family there make a deception jack deceive nine Petra says how did someone from amberwood village a defenseless woman end up in the middle of the city well I think I don't know if she's Fromm member wood village but her family's from inroad village she one more deception jack do seven really what's it what's her name who's her family we've both gone clear now it's your turn we don't know her name but we found her blinded she was attacked by bandits I believed her to be a follower of the flame okay persuasion check that's and now that's deception deceive deceive to see 15 Ansem says Petra something doesn't add up I thought you said these people were trustworthy you don't take here as a prisoner or some sort of slaver are you that's against Caspian law yeah good Caspian law now here we've we've been doing our trudging and we've we've been up to our business and we owe you your spoils so we may pass through the gate and I'm going to extend out fifty gold pieces I half expect I was gonna have to take this out of your cold dead hands thank you you wish hmm now let us through is that all you've got this is your share the agreement was 20% this is 20% of what we found we can do maths fine Petra says sorry about him he's still cranky that is 20% right yes Petra keep your eyes on your brother Oh believe you me I have to watch him all the time he's crazy he goes off into the city of the minute in the middle of the night he's one of our best fighters also I mean he can handle himself I'd be careful what you talk to your brother about did she get our letter yeah did you get our letter did your father get our letter he he hasn't told me about it no you said a letter yes and my best pigeon Bobby to come drop it off I don't know I haven't spoke to the commander if he got anything but if you sent him a message it might not have just moved through the chain of command yet Petra you need to go talk to him now about that letter and not tell anyone because we trust you okay are you gonna stay like no we have to be on our way but we will be back to talk to you about it all we can tell you is there's very important things happening in the city right now and we trust you but we don't trust many other people that includes unfortunately your brother I can't say more I just need you to trust me she looks at you really strange like I would trust my brother with my life sure he's cranky but that doesn't mean we can't trust him Petra I need you to trust me right now like you trusted me when I saved you in the rat's nest okay read your letter I won't talk to anyone but the commander about us thank you it's very important all right good luck with this one thank you good luck to you too I start to lead her through open and close the gates okay you head north from there towards Reed manner through the through the sprawl between Shepards way and Market Street a route that you've traveled once before making your way through rooftops and alleyways of the dilapidated buildings on the outskirts of the city you eventually come to the north cliff area where Reed Manor rests as you do you notice that Lenora turns to insists we were outside the city now aren't we yes my lady where are we we are close to the just south of North Castle area close to read manner she smiles underneath the Afghan and says ah I used to have friends here they had such marvelous parties and then kind of trails off completely and I think she may be party too hard too much right Sebastian too much delirium I mean we just want you to keep it in control only had one potion look that's what that always starts with I only had one and then one turns to two and turns too many listen I have it written in my notes here and then you're a weird Medusa one potion in a day bag I underlined it twice we know you're a rule breaker though okay you get that from me a short while later you come back towards read Manor the large the large matter house two stories tall with the second story still boarded up lights still kind of shining out style the afternoon you come up to the devil doors past the fountain way with the croaking frogs and knock on the door Gama the door is opened by a familiar face it's Marco zombified flight moment of surprise fashions like good to see your back up and about that's the spirit showed again Gama Gama the small halfling comes up and says oh it's you shame I was hoping you were going to die in the city but you're back here to bargain with a boss no we have more important matters where is he he's downstairs he told me that if he ever came back I was to bring you down there cool let's go fine chop chop she brings you back through the manor house and you can coming through the dilapidated living room into the study pulling the statue of the dragon head to open up the bookcase opening up the hatch and heading down as she does so she's like who's this don't worry about it it's important that we talked I asked her about a situation involving this woman here fine he ain't no healer I don't know if we need a healer alright well maybe the Queen can be our test subject you guys are gonna use me for the record so I think

infected by the delirium and we want to know if there's anything that you might know that can save her life bring her to the lab let's put her on this lab it's very important that she would can't promise you anything but we'll try come and he uh sure's you into his lab where once again this macabre laboratory with torture racks that have been converted into surgical tables surgical implements various racks chains and ropes all manner of coffins stacked up in the corner and bits of delirium capped on a shelf and you know on one of the bookshelves he has several books of research diagrams and he's also set up a large chalkboard that he's been furiously writing on seems like he's been doing some mathematical or arcane formula on it he he goes over to one of the open surgical tables this strapped kind of it's a strapped table that doesn't have a solid back to it it's almost this metal framing over the wood where then there's straps to strap someone in by their arms and legs and he says all right layer up on the table I'll help her out can't believe all the places to bring the Queen we brought her to a patient or his neighbor convert what's going on who is this he's someone who knows a lot about what's happened to the city and what's happened potentially to you he's a learned doctor and who is she don't worry about it Oscar just make sure she doesn't die all right strip her down and put him on the put her on the slow she'd say keep a little bit of her dignity well you've got her clad head-to-toe and wrapped up I can't see what I'm working with okay well I'm not gonna totally strip her down so all right sorry milady and I help kind of get her to do she says is he is he a doctor yes yes he's a special doctor for conditions like yours magic do you take her blindfold off yep okay she pulls as you pull things away Eddie he takes his hand he grabs her by the jaw whoa gentle kind of looks at her face he's not a gentle one he okay and he says all right lady open up your mouth and he looks inside he takes out a little scalpel and kind of looks inside our mouths as so I had hurt a little bit but I need a sample and he Clips away something from inside her mouth and then another little one of the scales on her cheeks well what was she human he looks down was she she was a human yeah what is she now there's something familiar about her who is she don't worry about it Oscar we have you Lily's not to ask questions she's been exposed to delirium in a high but sustained amount it's not unlike what I've done to myself but the dosage that she's has far higher some sort of wild magic something else it's transformed her can you reverse it or at least stabilize it I don't know what do you know well I can tell you straight up whatever is gonna happen to her I got any time to analyze her how much time days how many days I'll give you a week fine well the Lily's help do you need more blood yes more blood the Lily's her okay so let's just lay this all out we're giving you 24 Lily's in exchange for your help and your discretion and also doing your best to make sure no harm comes to her who is this like she's what's she doing with that necklace it must weigh the muscle be worth thousands what is this did you pull out some noble woman or what yes like I said discretion we it's on a need-to-know basis if I'm gonna be working on her if she's gonna be here for a week I need to know who she is one moment no no no moments you tell me right now who this woman is she is the noblest of women in Drakon Heim she is the queen that's little Ron castle yeah that's the queen which is why you didn't need to know and now you know discretion and now you're burdened with that knowledge like I am and there's stupid luggage you brought me some heck and this is a huge amount of baggage here yep it's if I'm caught with her the hard lanterns do they know no but you know what they'll kill me if they know I've got her they'll think I've been don't think I've done this to her you know Amy you're kind of in a life that does cuz we were gonna kill you yeah so it's you're kind of on borrowed time I to see you try all right we've killed a lot of things in the city but Leonard's get word that she's here they'll think that I've done this to her Oscar the hooded lanterns would have taken her in and possibly not given her back well what's happened to her is something that we can only trust somebody skilled with delirium you're the only person that we know who is as skilled with delirium as you are so unfortunately the burden does fall to you because you are oddly enough the only person that we can trust with this it's a big responsibility but you have to understand the gravity of this situation and how important this is for Drakon time even if you a bit of a scoundrel a princess is about me and her help a lot of lillius I certainly did like a lot yeah like you wanted like maybe for you tell me everything in delirium if you're if you're gonna operate this way this is how this is gonna go we're done I needs to know basis i mana needs to know basis and I need to know what you're doing here I need access to your research we found her with a bunch of melty face ladies and we took her out of the lily place and we just tell her we got a buncha lilies now we're here because she seems to the one garden yeah so in a weird way this is kind of my fault cuz I say good job we did a good job she was with the lilies yes she pretty much loved them more than anything they grew off of her and strokes his beard really they grew off of her energy yeah he turns to her says your majesty you're suffering from a grave condition my name is dr.
