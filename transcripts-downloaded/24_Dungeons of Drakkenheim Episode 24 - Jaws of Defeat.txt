off your first order when last we left our heroes they were imprisoned deep within the cisterns stronghold of the Queen's men and the queen of Thieves breaking free from their cells remarkably they fought their way past the bug bears that were guarding their cells freeing a member of the hooded lanterns in the process surveying the area of the complex they have been left deep underground it's easily over a hundred feet underground from what they can surmise they decided to instead of taking a few of the exits that were available to them push on deeper into the complex where they were confronted with the Queen's Counsel and now they sit in a small chamber at the top of the prison cells you've headed up about a level above where the prison cells are into a small guard room there is a table arrayed in front of you with several chairs around it a few sets of manacles and keys hang on the wall a set of switches as well there's the portcullis that you came up through or the room that the hatch that leads down to the prison cells leads to and then there are two doors one both on either side of the room from the hatch that came up one of which is behind you now the other door is the door that the Queen's Counsel exited and the queen of thieves entered you sit at the table with the queen of Thieves there's no one else in the room with you her appearance changes and shifts as she chuckles to herself taking the shape briefly of Jupiter Jones Oscar urine Petra lang Sten blackjack Mel the thugs that you fought and killed several weeks ago mauled briefly before finally settling to the shape of the woman in red from the bar fight that escaped she says this face will do for now you gave her a bit of a tough time I think this will be familiar but a little more personal I think for our conversation not too personal thank Lee it'll do so you've beaten down my thoughts you've burst out of all your chains you fought out of your cells and instead of taking the easy way out you're here talking to me now why are you no I know why it's because you want something isn't it you want something that I have she's good well you want we want things that you stole yeah you can we have our stuff you have it but you stole it it was our stuff but that's not why you're here is it nope why do you think we're here clean I have a theory but I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth that horse is dead it makes the same noise every time like a toy I mean there's lots of reasons why we we're here I mean do you want us to start from the very beginning we're technically here to climb the line bear me your life story and tell me why you come to see me because that seems to be what you were after well it wasn't it it was why we have to discuss the politics of TRACON hi politics of Drakon hein and you are part of the you are you are one of the people in charge of a large group of people that run part of Jacqueline and we came to talk to you to make sure that we can proceed without interruption and also there have been a few incidents lately and it is possible that you might know the whereabouts of somebody that we have business with so you're asking me not to get involved in something that is correct I like to be involved in business it helps me keep my fingers on the pulse of the city your involvement is to know that it's happening and not interfere then tell me what's happening we're gonna take care of an old problem go on we're building a better dragon hime and to do that we got to start at the bottom and that's the Noles if we deal with the Knowles I feel like we can start to make some headway towards dragon hime 2.0 but to do that we need you to kind of just keep doing what you're doing just over here in this area and we came to tell you that personally respectfully my queen m'lady a queen so who is helping you with this no problem we are not at liberty to say there's many parties involved to be honest I'm pretty sure everybody and somehow this wouldn't happened to involve our new guests to the city that have made camp outside the city walls or [Music] my old friend Elias Drexel would potentially she's gonna feel like you saying that you already know who's involved I have my suspicions and what is it worth it to you and your friends if I look the other way I've had many problems with both of the hooded lanterns and the silver order isn't likely to treat me very friendly afterwards either seems to me like it's the perfect moment for me to get a little bit of ahead of the game why shouldn't I seize upon it everybody in this city is always talking about getting ahead in the game against the other people in this city we're hoping to make a better track in time and I know we're just three people but were the only three people who are going around seemingly to all the factions and talking to their leaders we fought in your fighting pits in hopes of obtaining an audience with you so that we could talk respectfully about this we don't want all this backstabbing dragon hime even though I know that you have a knack for backstabbing the hooded lanterns see my people as liars murderers thieves and worse are they not it's a fair description in this Drakken haim 2.0 wherever that term it's a new term we're trying there's no place for my people I think there's room for all people in a new Dragon hime when one person or party isn't necessarily in control of everything I don't think you're in a position to make those promises on behalf of the silver order nor the hooded lanterns and I don't think that even if they made those promises to you that they would I don't expect them to keep it now making them on the behalf of the hooded lanterns or the silver order then you've come empty handed lady thief I am respectfully what if your men done for you other than get murdered by three people walking into a bar and we fought our way out of the prison and seemingly you can do better than the company that you currently keep what are the men worth to you why why is it so important that you have this grass there's more than just men here there's many others and yes I must say I'm impressed with your ability to cut them down and butcher them they're all just trying to survive and it's on them to do so but we can I must say I share your idealism at a city worth fighting for of a new place that is more than just ashes and scraps but the old ways the ways of the silver order the ways of the hooded lanterns they're not going to be new ways for my people for the people that I protect those people the reasons why their lives that why they've lost their lives to be murders deserters is because other people made those decisions for them half the people here are deserters from the wars that the hood that people like Elias Drexel force them to fight in the other half of them are just survivors trying to find feed feed their own mouths people who couldn't be protected by anybody else if we have to resort to banditry thievery scavenging to survive because we've done it on our own terms because certainly the hooded lanterns in the silver order they didn't care about any of these people someone has to look out for them well I'm kind of surprised you weren't in this game honestly I may have survived the city without necessarily a hand holding by the hooded lanterns but I did it without taking advantage of other people who are trying to survive which is what I've come across over my past 15 years in the city I wish others were so fortunate but they're not it's true and I think in a dragon hime that survives this massacre of the city that's happened it would be great if people didn't have to do this and that's what we're trying to help build towards and I'd say that it's it's not necessarily one factions job to get it there and Queen who do you think would be able to build a city that has your vision of the future do you think it doesn't include those other factions no I don't I have a different vision for this city one where it's a place of freedom with you ruling I would say I would question your definition of freedom then I would say you don't know what it means to be free maybe you're just a caged little cat maybe I am in any case I want Drakon hime to remain a free city no kings of God's no masters but that doesn't change the fact that Drakon hime is a different place the Delirium isn't going anywhere I'm working on some research on that we'll we'll see how that goes of course and when when that research is done is done it's just going to make everyone want it even more isn't it delirium of course like all is - you're friends with the Academy are ravenous form they can't get enough of it they want more and more and more and more and more and I don't know what they're gonna find out I have no idea what the delirium does what it could do what it could be but I know one thing when the amethyst of the Academy finds out the answer to that question and they've already started to answer it that little box of yours is something else do you really think the amethyst Academy is going to let anybody control Drakon Hine but themselves when I started on this mission Qwest thing i thought that the amethyst academy was the right people to lead into a new dragon hime but I won't disagree with you that I do have a lot of questions for them now on the other hand I am gonna need that box back you can't hand me the keys to the city on a silver platter and expect me to give them back we were even to hand them to you we are having a respectful conversation and you have taken some items from us that do belong to us and here we are having a nice chat around a table we fought our way here to talk to you and you've stolen from us and that is unfortunate and your possessions are mine but but as a show of good faith I offer their return plus interest - a few expenses for damages done to my operation and I have my goggles and my mother's book fair that seems fair can I have a wand I really like that that depends on the outcomes with this conversation so fair listen I don't think the amethyst Academy is bad by any stretch in fact their money is helping feed Mouse keep us alive here a fair number of my boys find pieces of delirium and the amethyst Academy doesn't care who who's who they're paying they'll pay us just as much as they'll pay anyone else for do you do that that's true that's how I've been living and I tell you that gold can do some beautiful things can't it it can feed a lot of mouths yeah so I see no reason to work with the amethyst Academy but I certainly would love to keep them as a customer is the smartest one we've ever met thank you so much did you say that oh I'm flattered I might have we have had our disagreements have we we kill them you have killed a bunch of minor they also had tried to attack yes they did they did without provocation we we never started a fight with them nah twice in the grand game that we play we could continue to have this sack and forth and I think you would make for healthy competitors but despite our misgivings I'm going to be honest I'm not interested in killing you you've proven disruptive but that's the cost of doing business in Drakon hein nevertheless what you're worth to me alive is also a matter of some depth there's some scales to balance I mean you're right we are really good at what we do throwing pebbles in the water we are really good at what we do it's just about turning us towards the right target I think that's that's great yeah we've just been turned towards certain targets and we haven't really found I would say the right target yet that really appeals to every piece of what we're looking for in Dragon hime I think there are pieces of everybody that really align with certain aspects but we haven't fit found anything that hits all the right boxes yeah and we're very capable as you can though mm-hmm so with the right motivation the right equipment and the right set of wands and the right goggles and the right goggles if you point us in the right direction maybe we can be mutually beneficial towards a new dragon hein you still owe me a debt and you still have to answer further all those mine that you've killed yes they attacked you but they're not going to like that I just let you live the ones in the fighting pit knew what they signed up for yeah I'm just saying that's true so what are you suggesting as this debt to be paid you can keep all my goal I'd like my gold and miss it well convince me of your value and win my wager and then we might have a partnership what do you value i keep company with thieves liars murderers and worse in my experience greed is far more honest motivator than trust and results speak far louder than loyalty I don't expect you to trust me oh we don't you would be very foolish if you did yeah turning code is my nature and I expect no less from you in fact consider it a mark of personalist I'd consider mark a personal respect if you've betrayed me one day but for now just creepy if you're to work with me show me that you're the only ones capable for the job Wow well I've got a little challenge for you I do love challenges is it uh okay so to reach our next goal we will pile as many corpses as necessary if it's a fighting challenge we're really good at that if it's a puzzle challenge seemingly not so much yeah give us any more puzzles no more cups I can't figure it out oh this way as we can fight the cups I want my my crew to know that you're under my control and there's only one way you're gonna prove that now you're gonna have to win over the Bob not me and there's only one thing the mob wants to see from you theory a fight a good fight yep a good fight if you show them a good fight and you don't die then we might have a deal you said we're worth more to you alive than dead I don't know that yet and if you can't win the fight you definitely aren't worth anything to me well that's fair I mean we've won every fight we fought so far I mean that's generally the way it goes yeah you only ever lose one fight yeah I'm dragon head well you can run away from the fence it's all losing that's so thinking about our deal if we fight this or in the respect of the crew what are we getting I'll give you your things back everything No what aren't we getting back I'm keeping clean Lenore's ring I'm keeping your fun little bomb oh and I mean it's not a bomb the stewards bad no no that is my only thing that I need need back it's my father's that ring makes me feel much more protected when I'm out there I don't even care about the ring and it's hard for us to just give you a bomb I'm keeping these incompetence and I will return them to you with interest once you've demonstrated that you can get results but I need a little bit of collateral here what if if we win you get to keep the box and we get to keep the key what kind of fool do you take me for that means that you cannot blow us up and we cannot blow you up no I'd like to be able to keep the ability to blow you up if I need to I don't feel like this is not an equal bargain we're in a position to make it sweeten the pot a little bit I know many secrets about the city I know many secrets too this actually brings me to the other thing that we are that we came here to talk to you about we're after Oscar you're I could tell you where he is that's not worked my father's badge no we still want that stuff back eventually listen if you prove yourselves I can offer you knowledge Drakken Heim is an old city there's tunnels passages catacombs everywhere they're dangerous many of them haven't been reclaimed we could claim them together so many lost treasures the Cathedral the Academy Tower maybe the castle itself in the heyday the old smugglers there were tunnels up to all of them and more and we could find some more answers and some more secrets if that's what you're really looking for and if that's not enough for you I know what happened to Johan Eisner I know why you were expelled from the amethyst Academy and I also know about George what do you know about my father I know where he is I know what happened at least I know the last person who ever saw him how on earth would you know why I was expelled from the Academy information is my business please that means there's a leak in the Academy I'm willing to do whatever it takes to find my father and I'm willing to help you towards that goal but I'm keeping the badge until the time comes that you need it he's good those I don't know though I know yours was a big name drop I'm nervous about anybody who knows anything about anything we'll get to that no one else could give me that information I have been asking for years about where my father is and do you think the hooded lanterns rival tell me no you think anyone was able to tell me no the amethyst Academy was extremely particular in the my expulsion I don't know well I'm concerned do you does it really surprise you that she has this information yes do you want to keep it secret considering she turned into River yes okay I have a question Green River is a real person right like the person I grew up with at the river oh yeah yeah yes yes of course she is yes okay is there anyone who we've met who isn't a real person I mean this is the first time we've been in the same room together I was gonna ask that have we met before we haven't had the pleasure we met before she's tripping me out no this is the first time I've met any of you in person but I know a lot about you all we're famous I can read you like a book speaking of books that's that's in the cards for me to get that back right everything but those three things to be honest I'm I want to know when the time is you think is appropriate for me to get this badge back hmm because it's it's the only thing in this whole of the world that I value more than anything excellent I'm open with that good it's good to know that it's the only thing in this whole world that you value I mean other than my dad my dad I guess I value more than that badge are we on the list and you guys you guys do are you sure that badge has been with me longer than you guys have but I do value your lives over a piece of metal of course we just wanted to hear you say it like we really want to do you say it in that moment [Laughter] what do you need me to do I love those words she's got us we can fight we can win over the mob we can be spectacular wonderful show me what you've got with that she stands you uh better get ready we'll have you up in an hour I know that you promised that we could get our stuff back after we prove ourselves can I get a spell casting focus we have it now I mean I have a bag full of garbage that I picked up in your dungeon that's allowing me to cast spells but it doesn't feel as it's a bag you just you have to reach it and have to reach in and hello cobwebs and are you asking me for a fair fight yeah I know I'm asking you for a spell casting focus so I can cast spells are those using garbage beyond that door yeah take the stairs down to the army room hopefully you can find something useful to you the arming room I love the arming room if you had more arms you'd be fine you could just are we all arming up you got an hour make of it what you will well it's hurry and she stands up readjusts her appearance again and steps back go through the door what are you did did she just walk into the room and convince us all to fight on her behalf oh man she knows where my dad is literally like numero uno prevail okay now I'm referring more to myself at the third-person little who's George shirt more importantly I wanna use the feature know your enemy after we chitchat mmm-hmm it does she have more total class levels than me yes and Acey does it let you know her current armor class or does it tell you that it just says if it's higher or lower equal superiors your AC is currently very low okay you're not in play tower is that what you want to choose no no I mean your AC is what right now it's like 50 that still gives us a feel like she's gonna be my bad back I feel like asking that might be beneficial cuz you're in the mid ground so knowing if she is higher or lower he's beneficial if you were at 20 I'd assume she's lower I'd feel like she's superior but maybe hitpoints I have 67 right now does she have she equal to me she has more than you oh she's so strong she leaves the room and that's what you've surmounted she's a lot stronger she's a lot stronger and a lot more powerful to me I gave her one up and down in the way oh boy I guess we're fighting so yeah I'm gonna follow her instructions I'm gonna go down open the door head down the stairs cuz we can chitchat while we yeah I follow arm ourselves we we what it what happened she dangled the tuna in front of me and I went for it she's got us yeah I mean you had way stairs and it leads into a small arming room that is roughly forty feet by 40 feet in size the stairs come down into the end of the room and there's two doors leading off into other passages that both one going down another set of stairs in the room there are two augers clad head to toe and chainmail holding large hammers and there's another there's another set of stairs leading up out of the army room as well and but there's a closed portcullis over it how that portcullis opens from this room is not clear in the room are several benches small tables there's some water and bread and a few haunches of meat one of the ogres is leaning on his hammer and eating a leg of turkey as he regards you he nods yeah he says did you come in queen says you could take what you can carry if you can use it in the room are an array of martial weapons ammunition a few sets of leather hide and chainmail armor some shields and there are some staves that you could use as a spell casting focus any jackets I'm still wearing right there there are some there are some bits of clothing white jackets and Jerkins and things like that of leather that wouldn't represent putting on the full leather armor but enough that you don't feel naked thank you hmm I've been walking around in underwear notably there are no goggles yeah I throw together an outfit that looks most reminiscent of the Sebastian Monroe just a ragtag group of scoundrels I okay I'm gonna put on that chainmail okay I grab a staff I grab the coolest stuff uh there is one staff in there that does have like a focusing crystal affixed to the end of it and you pick that up I pick it up and I look at the ogre I'm like does the crystal glow when I cast spells cool [ __ ] goes good I'll take it style is important when you're trying to woo the masses as as you're arming yourselves you can take a short rest well while you put these these on but after a few minutes there's a cry coming down the stairs as someone as you hear footsteps running down and huffing down the stairs that are coming to the portcullis and you see at the bottom of the stairs banging on the portcullis is blackjack mell no I can't believe it you guys made it here you're gonna fight in the Queen's arena that's kind of ironic but awesome you got us here Mel I know I told you I get you here I put in a good word for you the Queen said she had to size you up you already got your audience never let it be said that blackjack Mel doesn't come through for his friends so I'm gonna get a cut yeah right yes fantastic is swag Wagner with us he has been been brought with you but he's not gonna fight in this and the the one of the over one of the ogres points to him and says you there come back up the other way is he gonna be okay he'll be fine I think we failed that rescue does does blackmail find it odd but I'm now he does but after a moment he figured he he says there's a ton of cool cats down here you didn't have to hide who you really are never be afraid to show who you really are in the inside this is a very affirming and safe space I mean despite all the violence and murder the Queen's men are so progressive this is actually quite refreshing I'm really concerned I kind of like it here I feel like I've probably been doing the same thing that they've been doing the whole time in dragon home we aligned with them so much more than we want to admit and I think that's what's so scary that's what's so scary is that I don't want to make the leap I have friends in both the heroes of track and everything yeah are we but sometimes in Dragon I'm you got to do what you got to do to make it happen which is the Queen's views on Dragon height blackjack now everyone's all abuzz they say that you guys have challenged the Queen's for the championship bout everyone's excited all the boys are here everyone's coming down it's gonna be amazing tell them to put bets on me do we still go buy fresh meat or have you come up with a better name for us that's a good question I mean I'm supposed to introduce you after all well Mel I think what we're looking for the queen Strikeforce where were we need to wow them out there okay we need not just a name but we need some spectacle some some pizzazz we we want to put on a show that's gonna that's gonna just ring throughout the arena for four decades well the name with a great name really hope you don't die up there I mean I got a lot riding on you guys I mean I might have made some side bets don't tell anyone but you know we cooked the books here it's how we get by well we haven't died yet that's a very good point now maybe maybe you have some tips on what is the crowd love do they love the decapitation love decapitation they love ox of blood they love broken bones they love burning bodies is it like a close fight or do they like something that's one-sided like how can we make them you gotta give them a little bit of everything if I murder someone with arrows will they like that they probably will perfect this is good this is good food arrows from my bow hit the people they die hey guys I got a plan you're gonna shoot arrows I'm gonna cast spells am I gonna do I mean the Queen's champion rumor has it she's really something else it's gonna be pretty exciting wait what do you know about the Queens champion yeah now what do you know all I know is that the Queen founder in the ruins she was crazy took a ton of people to bring her in they call her big Linda Oh what she is never seen her at all in my life before but gotta warn ya there's another group that's come down here they're gonna want they're gonna challenge you to a go at the at the title you got to go through them before you get to challenge big Linda are they as good as the bugbear that we fought in the last arena remember those guys I was gonna put you up against before yeah we got him great Mel great Mel your honestly your enthusiasm is infectious yep and I'm actually getting really excited even though we could die so what am I gonna call you all how am I gonna introduce you the or probably it's probably best to cause the Jackson three all right guys I think that this is not gonna work anymore I need a real name this is it this is it blood blood barbecue I mean if it doesn't work out you can always break up and reform under a different name that kind of thing happens all the time guess what's her name this is it this is the moment what was her what was our gang name what was the play we put on called the angel of virtue and the devil of sin we are the three ghosts we are come on guys were the ghosts all right I can go with it well go I don't get the joke but we'll go to ensure confidence that we're gonna live like we're the Ghostbusters I think that's copyrighted are we the there's no time we'll go with it they will see what the Dragonforce know what's it gonna be we'll figure it out maybe we'll have to put it to a vote sometime we could just be Baio Sebastian and Pluto bsp well I'm gonna do yeah we are this this yes I hate coming up with a name and it's and you gotta say it and it kind of spit a little bit no you know what no you know what's better than anyone yeah you announce what's in your heart when we come out there no my name is alright I'm Deb knife-cut people I am NOT human I am anyways the other competitions coming down here to arm up too so stay out of their way till the fight you know don't let it break out first I guess they want the show they want the show we'll give them a show when you're all ready you just let ugly here know that you're ready and and they'll they'll bring you up name his name the over like crosses know what it what's your name my name is my name is up bar people just call me ugly it's not funny thank you on the inside maybe I just met you what else is in the room a bar is there a hand crossbow anywhere oh yeah there's yeah well should i I can yeah there's at least one of each weapon that you could possibly want and means I could and you can take your short rest if you need to over the course of the hour is there anything else you didn't want to do a prepare before you go into fight I start eating all the food on the table including a bigger turkey leg can I have one okay can I have a piece of bread is there like extra utility stuff like rope the small red torches or there's there is some rope and you could definitely throw together a torch okay yeah I'm gonna make a torch take some rope - who knows you never know okay I have to do like the Empire Strikes Back go for the lights I'm in the big Linda drop her legs after a few minutes you could already start to hear that there is the loud sounds coming from the short hallway that leads to the two leads off the rooms you can start to hear this roaring crowd in the distance chanting and saying calling out for blood and and murder after a short while blackjack Mel comes back down says alright you already did the other group also come in and get armed up they came into the other army on the other side you guys pumped I'm kind of pumped I don't know this is this is this is exciting we're stars I always wanted to be under the circumstances I don't appreciate being blackmailed into fighting but that's actually yeah it's really mature of you very yeah but if I to fight you know cause I'm not do you know I feel like this is a necessary evil if we we kind of got ourselves into this mess if anything the one thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do one crossword every day from now on so I will never fall fall apart during puzzle time do you remember that time when we had a choice to continue fighting in some pits or going down to investigate some traps and we chose the traps and somehow we've ended back in the pits isn't that funny how life goes life's life's interesting like that Mel I think we're ready alright there was no potions or anything right make an investigation joy I'm not good at that - not that you could find her I didn't I find liquid there's water whose Lots bottles water okay I'm gonna hydrate okay all right guys you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs so it's going to smash some skulls their heads yes their heads are eggs yeah but we're gonna make so many omelets omelet it's gonna be a buffet I just ate but now I'm hungry again wrench Mel leads you down not down the hall and says you know they had a bit of a warm-up fight before you got there so you know the Bloods already kind of pumpin just just you know if you it's a little loud in there but is this exciting stuff exciting stuff he leads you down a hallway that is filled with dust flecks of blood scratches in the walls of many it's like the old Ackerman mill scratches in the walls of the last words of people that as they came to fight many of which have been scratched out and at the end of the hallway lit with torches there is a big set of double iron bound doors that another ogre is standing in front of with his arm arms crossed and you can see that he lifts the bar off the the door and he says won't you're in you're in you don't come out and tell you in one second I'm gonna mold earth and scratch our names into the wall Dragonforce sure I was just putting our names but okay yeah all righty he opens the doors and there's a surprising amount of light comes through and Usher's you through the doors is it breathtaking in front of which my breath is a massive underground cave which is supported by four great pillars that are holding up the the cave itself however this cave came in to being it's not clear it looks like it might have once been a Fisher of some kind but then these four pillars of stone have been erected in here to hold up and support the entirety of it it kind of curves into a rough dome shape over top the whole thing is roughly a large square at the at the base in the room as you come through there's bits of rubble and ruin because you can see that there are two large bubbling pools of acid in the arena floor and on the opposite side there is a great cavernous cave and there's a small looks like a bit of water that is flowing over it like a veil that is then draining in a set of drains underneath there's another set of doors directly opposite you built of the same construction and then lining the entire space about 40 feet up because the cavern itself is roughly 60 feet high the lining the the whole way carved our box seats and balconies all in in the cavern including one great balcony stretching across over the acid pools where you can see seated on a throne of sorts is the queen of thieves who has taken has it has taken the same form that she had in the last meeting with you that of the the thief Cora uh and she is surrounded by the counselors that were with her earlier and then you can see that the whole area is filled with all manner of these Queen's men of all the different gangs they're all kind of all sitting in their own sections in this in the midst of this massive underground arena and the chanting is overpowering people are screaming and they're saying various things like raff and there the whole place smells like sweat and desperation alcohol a little bit of urine popcorn and then there's that acrid smell of the acid as well we just want to make a spectacle of her entrance do we do we shake hands with them are we gonna

enters a smaller woman and she is wearing a skull for a helmet that then has horns coming out from it and you can see that it looks like she might be carrying a wand of some kind and she has these streaking red capes that are coming off of her shoulders and looks like she might be wearing leather armor behind them comes out a hulking ogre that is wearing a helmet that cut totally conceals his face spiked pauldron armor and he is carrying a massive spiked chain that he's swinging in a wide arc the three of them enter and as both groups and enter the queen of Thieves raises her hand and the

attacks against you have advantage but you can still act and move you're jus just you can still act you just can't move your speed is zero and if you do make attack roll as you have disadvantage well my my panic reaction is Sebastian try to cry Sebastian starts crying and yells oh God I don't want anybody to see this and he cast darkness using sorcery the crowd is confused and yeah that's that's what he does alright we go to the top of the round today oh all right I'm gonna stay where I am but I'm gonna still take some shots at the big guy okay with my longbow oh no seven 7:15 that will hit

great beyo anything else okay so now we go to Kazama cool so she continues to focus on her guards black tentacles but she steps for she steps forward teleporting thirty feet across the acid pool and then she uh and then she casts Eldridge blast on Sebastian disadvantage no because she can see in magical darkness man I'm getting a at least I don't see it yeah getting a twenty five to hit okay it's okay dealing seven force damage and then her second beam is another twenty five to hit walk to 19 s for another eight force damage she fires the bolts of eldritch energy towards you good eye you just

of my collection let's have some fun because we have a t-rex what did she just say what is that what's a quick into your legends speak of an ancient creature and we found it mutated and disgusting in Drakon hime I present to you big Linda what definitely physically big Oh coming through the archway is a massive reptilian creature a Tyrannosaurus Rex but it's it appears to if you look closely at it it almost looks like it's a bit of an amalgam of other lizards because its body is covered in the smaller eyes and mouths of smaller lizards that of all like melded into the flesh of this creature as its eyes glow purple and its mouth drips with octarine goo and it hops forward and like there's a shower of haze and mist around it as it enters into the Arina it is this massive bipedal Tyrannosaurus Rex with tiny little arms and a massive mouth that could swallow you whole as it comes into the room you can see that there is a set of manacles on its feet that have been detached and it seems like it's chewing on someone that might have been keeping it back there this has been fed and as it comes into the arena it howls out ah and the queen of thief says dinner served Pluto get her initiative Oh big limb is a lot bigger than I thought and she rolled a one on initiative right big Linda is a legendary creature and has several additional points as well I get a 10-4 baby by using my idle handling 1880 12 okay so you all go first and then show me what you got who goes first yeah no I think that's better okay this okay interface Beast not interface just gobs forward and the crowd is silent like people are petrified like a bunch of people are crouching behind but it's uh so a few people say gather you could do it are they cheering for us there's a few people that say that and like others say eat them eat him get him it seems like many of the thieves are too scared to even look upon this horrid creature gluto Yura you are up you got this man I retrieve my my spear from what's-his-face halberd dude yeah that's her forgettable he was just like you're gonna be big Linda and I just kind of day and then I just I kind of do a slow run and then I start speeding up and I'm

reptilian scales third beam 19 he's a hit seven more damage okay last beam Oh God nope that's a 10 I go wide I shoot wide that was a warning shot okay she spends her next legendary action to move oh and she rushes forward in between the two of you towards you Sebastian her movements 50 feet do I get a free hit on her I think she's big enough that she stays in your reach as she moves forward I swing wildly out of it from my well I chritmas okay I'm still five feet ten feet away I just swing at her and I'll be good enough Oh God so I backing up as she's like running towards me and I'm just like stepping backwards cool uh and as she she steps forward she kind of she lumbers forward on her turn and she kind of you see her like looks like she's almost like choking up a hairball what where am i spelling I have a few here Oh God this she horse up a cloud of toxic delirious goo forward no no does that include the Queen it angles down because they're 40 feet up fair right she horse it forward and two of you can make dexterity saving throws good nineteen six well that went that turned bad that's a lot of these X's 20 30 38 points of necrotic and acid damage no thanks and the two flaming platforms are melted away by it you say but you still take half okay yeah oh my gosh just even remove the bases they're totaled by it and I'm just standing there in front of her man yes yeah looking bad cool point we go to the top of the round with pollute oh I stand up okay and I yell hey big Linda I think the L stands for loser I ain't done with you and I just walked past she just walk right past you and vomited on side very man I'm very mad at that cuz that's insulting I'm not just lasting striker yeah not anymore I used everything and I just start I just start like running and like hitting her in the back I hope not fruitlessly 19 to hit that hits 415 damage and 13 that's a Miss yeah action surge just keep wailing wailing no another 19 for 14 damage nice and so I'm just hitting her and I'm hitting her and then I'm gonna use my second wind to get some help back cool and she's gonna use her legendary action to slap you with the tail Oh getting a 20-7 to hit that's gonna be only 17 points of bludgeoning damage and make a strength saving throw ooh 22 okay you are not not grown it would have been funnier if I went flying but this is more tactical Dale you're up all right I am going to try to continue to run around staying close to the edge of the acid pool I'm gonna go 30 yeah and I want to crouch behind this tiny piece of rubble 12 this does not penetrate her hide 15 that does five feet of Pluto's yes she is I'm whacking her 22 damage that leaves her bloodied yes as she howls out enrage her breath weapon recharges you can see the huffing and the oozing forth even as this delirious iCore leaks from the wounds that suffuses her body instead of blood and she uses her legendary action to tail slap Sebastian getting a 22 hit No Oh Sebastian you take 20 points of bludgeoning damage and give me a strength saving throw there buddy 9 ok Robi a d6 to determine how far you are sent flying 1 okay so she swings the tail around smashes you and you are knocked 5 feet and knock prone and dying okay mm-hmm Sebastian give me that death saving throw nope okay okay focused oh can you get him over to me the what he gets faster over to me get him over to you I don't know meet halfway [Laughter] I'm worried bout big Linda turn towards Vale after taking that critical that that shot and she unleashes her breath weapon only a part of a Oh No they'll give me a dexterity saving throw dodge it ten oh my gosh I'm gonna be dead too I was gonna be 30 points you down down oh okay Ludo you're up all my friends are dying I'm gonna die I'm gonna address the Queen enough enough call off your beast you can have me but let my friends live there doesn't there need nin be more bloodshed big Linda has proven her work these are monsters these aren't this isn't a fair fight we need to if you really want to challenge us you'll you'll send one of your personal guard don't let her eat my friends big Linda it's not fair please I beg you I'm begging for my Mahalo crowd he's begging shall we let them live or die I start the chant okay love blue tote give me a persuasion check with advantage 1414 okay the crowd is mixed in in their response and the Queen turns to the the creature and she then turns to the old the old woman old beggar Mary beside her and she says Mary call it off and Mary casts charm monster on big Linda and the dinosaur stands there a gaggle I rush over to Sebastian cradling his says she she points to another and says go get them the other wounds I I drop my weapons and and I'm gonna give you have a potion on you right I give Sebastian one of his own potions and then I I immediately run over to video to do the same yeah you have one right yeah and and Pluto's torrent he defeat wasn't on the table but you know a planned retreat is probably the best strategy big Linda ooh big Linda just had her away Big L I think I I just fall to my knees in front of the Queen cool a few of the Queen's ogres come out and collect and stabilize Sebastian and Baio and the Queen says folks I give you my champion big Linda let this be a reminder to all of you even these heroes that have given us so much trouble so far bow down before the queen of Thieves I give a deep bow as the you to get to your feet I take a knee I take a knee excellent now we can start the next steps enjoy the blah I hope you enjoy it all enjoyed the bloodbath will have big Linda back next week he says as the as old beggar Mary steps out into the field and waves her hand too big too big Linda and motions her back into the cave this small frail older woman with her eyes glowing with magic as she pulls the creature back and coaxes it into the cave again I picture as like like that as the t-rex is walking like the tail swinging and it doesn't care where it's swinging you have to like dodge out of the way of it because it's so big I'm they collect you and they bring you back into the arming room friends I'm sorry I'm sorry yeah I I threw myself at the mercy of Queen I know it's not a dragon force style but Ludo I was worried I might lose you you saved us yeah you saved me and bam I saved you and bayo you saved me I care about you and bayo but I care about I care about Vale I care about surviving and being alive so thank you I appreciate that avail yeah you did great I'm hungry I know you are yeah where's this myself a little bit of bread sorry to god I was gonna ask if you wanted to split it as you eat leaves comes down into the into the arming room and she is beaming and she says wonderful I could not have asked for a better display or show if we had planned it directly you put on all the airs I needed to see from you you had done so well now and all of the my men know who's in charge had you actually defeated big Linda it would have been incredible but this is far more convenient for keeping control of the mob so we did go them I'm not saying I've been so much pain it makes it much more convincing as much as illusions and control are good they need a little bit of truth to make them truly bite I guess we should have known what we were getting into when we walked into a battle arena I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I'm in pain my life flashed before my eyes and it was mostly fire and problems hints of hints it's true and with a little luck we'll be a few more incidents before it's all over I must admit it would have been nice to see big Linda tear you limb from limb what but on the other hand you are useless to me as corpses worthless in fact if i was going to steal your lives i would rather spend them dearly first sound that's ominous but it's also like you telling us you care about us so i appreciate that it's good math do we not get our stuff back Oh contraire I think you've earned a grand reward everyone was talking about how fearsome you three were how many of my men you had slain and by being defeated by my monster in such a public and dramatic way you prove to the mob that I have control of the situation which is exactly what they needed to know your welcomes is all part of the plan huh we knew it all along where's Mountain we should have Mel here for me probably it was just some money he's laughing all the way to the book keepers he bet against you good job now honey really proud about yeah I mean the right call I'd bet against us too if I had known Wow so here's where we stand well you barely I think you're welcome to a little more medical attention once we're done here but oh thank you here in the meantime I think we can have a rather profitable partnership don't you think of be profitable for Dragon hun potentially I hope so we played your game we fought we gave the crowd a great show we need some time to heal but then we need to get down to down to business we also do have a date in like two days that we need to make right with the Lord of the feast and the hooded lanterns in the silver order we didn't mention that whatever is it clean all right yes I don't know we don't have to again I think it's gonna be more beneficial for her for us to do it she probably knows my middle name never told anybody even told me it's danger that's not true it's not true I did it so I will return your possessions to you I'm keeping the badge now and the ring the chest and the key you know keep any of Pluto's stuff cuz my stuff's all worthless I mean no I was going to give that armor of yours to mold but you killed him she's right we did and then we can work together on the next steps some of my council members would like to meet with you they have a few objectives that we can work on together in the meantime you have my assurances that none of my people will interfere with temple gate or whatever operations you're planning there that includes not interfering with the hooded lanterns or the silver order during our attack on temple gate only during the attack fine I also want to just say like just as like a like a semantics sort of thing technically you taking our stuff kinda is interfering do you play on those technicalities what if we plan to use the bomb on the lord of the fees so like we kind of like so really you kind of are interfering by taking the stuff that would be a tremendous waste wouldn't it can I have my goggles back yes you can have your things back these this weapon this thing that the amethyst academy has created they're going to make another one I'm sure they are I wouldn't doubt it and they'll use them but they'll be afraid to use one if they don't know where one of them is I actually strangely agree with this to have that much power in one group of we had that pattern I know and now that we don't you have to accept that we don't okay so I can understand the arms race that is now being created how mad do you think they're gonna be when we tell them we lost the body furious fortunately it's not your fault I did it to you so you can blame me they're still gonna blow that's not gonna help they will be but they'll be true worried about what has happened to it to do anything about it now we don't my father's bad badge I am at a disadvantage with this battle I need the badge back if you got the badge back I'm getting the ring back these things this badge this ring are only the rightful property of those who hold the titles of Dragon hunt and they bar the way to a much bigger prize if you retrieve for me one of the other badges of office of dragon hein I will return your father's badge to you in trade where can I find these badges that's your problem but the Lord Commander has one no sir how many are there in the heyday of drackett highness the Kings small council consisted of an Archmage a steward the Lord Commander the castle in the high flame keeper the guild master and the Lord Mayor and finally the Queen's seal with those nine pieces we might be able to achieve something very interesting I mean get into the castle more than that have you tried to go over the walls yes oh yeah done it yeah real problem you know those beasts that attacked you were not created by the Delirium those were part of the city have you seen that monster in slaughter stone square yep yeah it was built by the city by the people are you catching my drift these small Council held the keys to the city you think they can control I do the city we can control the slaughter so stone square corpse collector and the walls and the walls and reclaimed rack and I'm Bo and right now she's on our way the doing it no but she needs us and I think we need her this is the best plan I've heard so far yeah yes you really should have come to me sooner well if you didn't send people to try to kill us we might have come to talk to you we were we got off on the wrong foot with the fact that the first time we ran into your men they were trying to murder children and old people [Music] still no I mean I don't have them myself right now hi I think the only way to go forward is to go with this plan but Queen I need you to know that you preach about freedom but I feel like I've got a rope around my neck freedom isn't free seems to be your for all your thieves they pay that price every day in many ways many of them never know when the dagger is gonna hit them in the back or and they're going to be the one at the wrong end of a blade but they fight for their freedom I'm just keeping a little bit of collateral so that I know that you fight with me do you have any idea where we could find any of these unclaimed badges we know that the Lord Commander has won but is there any that are unreachable for you I have my suspicions the castellon of saint salinas abbey no one knew what happened to him but now that's crazy cult controlled Saints illumise the high flame keeper where was she dead in the cathedral perhaps the Archmage dead in the mage town who knows the Lord Mayor the guild master other corpses still in the Grand guild hall I'm not in the business of risking my own life he must understand and well my thugs and thieves are competent and I have some excellent agents I don't think I have anyone that would have lasted two rounds with big Linda Systrom well I don't disagree with the mission she's giving us we're collecting the badges they probably needed to do it anyways we just now have the information I don't mind aligning ourselves at least for now I am so confused but I mean you mentioned the Cathedral we are gonna go there anyway so it's not like we can't take a gander around to see if there are more and our goal was to get in before everybody else well if when you go to the Cathedral if you find the body of the high flame keeper and retrieve her phylactery I will trade that for your father's badge and if you would like to kill two birds with one stone perhaps you could bring me the Lord commanders pendant as well what about the whereabouts of Oscar yarn we have business and I hope that he's not an agent of yours because our business is finished I have a contract but I need to fulfill when my little birds find me where he is you will be the first to know how will you get a hold of this probably in person do we have like a secret handshake or something for you to tell us that you're you because you could be anyone you can literally be in one we have a like a we haven't seen where we say pork chops like I know just hid pork chops into the the verbage and we all know it's you most of my other my other followers know me by this face okay so your true face oh so it's the woman in red that we saw in the first I'm nothing I'm no one who I am is not as important as what I am don't forget that what are you I'm quicker than thought I'm more silent than contemplation and I'm more slippery than a fading memory and more unshakeable than a guilty conscience I can fulfill your wildest dreams or I can be your worst nightmare and I look forward to working with you hmm yes we will work with you looking forward to it but I think we're on the same path towards us a similar goal I look forward to it to recite in the name of the Queen I do fight in the name of the Queen you do meio and I do oh and do me a favor and don't dispel the Lord commanders paranoia's about my animosity towards your little prize that's a very useful distraction to have him play oh but the bomb no no I'm talking about Leonor oh wait what I made so sure not to mention yeah she already knew her about her remember you know we were worthy perfectly frank I don't care she's a monster now no one will ever take her claim seriously what about what about the other children of Leonor what do you what do you know about them no children there are no children no they're not children anymore what I mean it was 15 years ago they're all grown up now yeah where are they do you know maybe if we get you another badge will you tell us well you have to do a little bit better than that I know many secrets and for every badge you bring me I'll give you a secret better till then the demon was giving us a question she just wants us to like go on a collection mission yeah go to all the tourist attractions in Drakon Heim collect souvenirs and bring them back to her just a bunch of we're just collecting badges yeah it's like Pokemon exactly I don't know what that is oh it's where you go and you capture monsters you poke men with yours catching them we just kill them yeah we kill monsters gotta kill them all gothic kill them all I have many answers and I know many secrets I don't know all of them but I'd be surprised feel like you're at least the most willing to bargain with us for information of course there's profit in it isn't there can I ask you a question what did what did you do before the meteor fell guessing lawyer I'm gonna go with you work with your hands like a Mason hey how do you have a guess actor that's actually maybe I'll tell you someday she has she's in where well I think I'm ready for a nap yeah clearly can we stay so we stay over but I sleep over or not in Chains certainly I owe you that much at least sweet thank you and about my goggles [Laughter] please give us welcome and overcomes it comes into the room with a large satchel that has the remains of your belongings and another satchel that is brimming with gold how much cold did we get our original gold back as well no all your gold the Queen laughs I'm sorry lies and deceit took that yeah are they they they did a very good job bringing them to me I can't deny them a good reward they did an excellent excellent job I feel like I'm gonna lose is cuz I drank the milk but there is a bag containing 500 gold pieces for each of you yeah I dropped that's okay that's better than zero I got more do you want the difference between my gold and no reach we're even for all you consider it's and professional advance if you like the look of that there's more of that too the quest is over we can all go home I got my bracers that's more uncomfortable HP is so low I mean my I feel weaker than normal everything's heavy everything the air is heavy my body is heavy you may you look good kid my associates will lead you to a chamber where you can rest this location here is secrets so we are going to secret you out of it okay when you wish to leave blindfold listen let's turn us around and take us into different directions although we know like half of the way to get yeah I don't think I want to go that way again Oh through the corpse pits okay with that the queen of Thieves leads you to the takes her leave and a few of the others she comes away and the two of the ogres from before big ugly come in giving you back your belongings and say all right I'll lead you up to the bunks and and every day like can we do our classic sleepover like in the middle of the room where we all have our heads and then we're in like a in like the tripod thing we can all hold hands and we're like wow what a day as we sleep reflecting she's laying in the room head to head remember that time we thought a t-rex yeah what do they never actually it's called a big Linda ah yeah I think we could have taken her give us one more shot we could take her I wonder if I practice enough if I could turn into a big Linda she was bleeding 30 hit points left I don't know you could have even two big hits I might not have got her but it worked out in our favor yeah that's a key thing if we had killed big Linda we might not have gotten where we wanted I've just never killed a t-rex never even saw one till today yeah me neither also never killed one kept just tail slapping me I have I look at my my my naked body and it just I have like like giant giant bruise yeah like it takes up my whole chest in retrospect when the when the monster was charging at me slowly backing up 15 feet was not the best choice in retrospect I'm just like it didn't lawyer from Jurassic Park yeah yeah you hide the toilet I should have climbed up the wall what a day but guys well survive we're still alive have to we we've got the Queen kind of working when she's listening to us right now probably she in my head she said she got it we're still in her place of operation creepy guy that came over is probably hanging outside the door so as long as we're here can't make any plans I'm so excited to be working with the queen of thieves she seems like a very good person to think about what she's like not paying attention and we just fall asleep all thinking about cats try to avoid detection Katzen and and rainbows and and a bright sunny day at least he can head back and tell the commander that we lost a bomb sound Oscar oh yeah he didn't know we just have to tell him that we took care of the Queen River is gonna be mad about the boy yeah we don't have to tell nobody nothing they have to read our minds to find it we're done revealing our secrets is this a freedom field look so before he's right freedom isn't free before the attack on the wall our mission was to make sure the Queen didn't interfere which we accomplished and to find Oscar yarn and bring him back alive which we was that was like a like a miner and we stuff to meet the cult of the following fire to see if they will stay out of it that is true guys if we go and do the attack and the queen of thieves doesn't hold her head to the bargain what do we do well then her face we call her on it cuz she don't you know what as much as she is the queen of the using like shifty I feel like she she caught her amongst thieves yeah there is a sense of like I feel like she's the most up that she's the most forward-facing of all of them nothing about her except for the fact that she won't show us I was about to say nothing about her seem deceitful well she's not revealed her true identity but yeah she she's pretty upfront about her intentions she's told us literally like I feel like she's revealed her master plan she's revealed the most I still think she's the least trustworthy and honor a lot of all of them but we used to honor what he's honorable yes what's that Elise trustworthy I find her just as trustworthy is I don't know I can trust her too she was she honored her word when she sent us to fight a t-rex she even spared us what she also could she had every opportunity to kill us that she finds stabbing people in the back respectable she stabbed us in the back at any time I think that's a good thing she already could have stopped us in the back a million times she could have slit our throats and then she's gonna try to kill us yeah but as long as we're doing work for her that falls in line with what we want to do anyways then it's beneficial the moment that we have gotten to a point where she's like now I will rule dragon hime then we murder her yeah yeah so let's just kind of play our pieces like you know and for all we know she might end up being a great asset and maybe we want her to rule dragon hein no just say it while we're in here yeah then you never need to murder her we'll see there's a maid never knew murder Sebastian she's your wings though oh god oh god but you're gone she won't be surprised if a backstabber him totally honest just like she is no murder needed though I'm sorry that we lost your bed but at least we have a clear way to get it back I know and maybe we can even find some information about my father that's like a bonus I've never ever had any information about my father from anyone so this is that I know I'm positive my dad said we lost and like you're the ring I mean the ring wasn't sentimental to me it was just kind of cool and magical and made me feel stronger in battle but yeah so I think yeah I'm I'm sorry but I would love for you to know more about your your father's whereabouts don't find my father and just get out of Dragon home you know and I solved I really want to know more about George know about of caspia yeah there's um we should sleep Pluto tell me about George how did you get kicked out of the Academy things happen it's oh I think habits dream you got a bit edgy about it so there was an incident well of course it's the nature of the incident that I'm interested in there have been moments in my life where I dabbled in magic that maybe I wasn't prepared to dabble in and mistakes were made the Academy was not happy about it but they helped me cover up an accident oh we want from incident to accident there was an accident sounds like a scary story I'm not comfortable talking about it here where I don't know if we're being listened to maybe some time yeah save it for the date I'm not the night time save it for our walk to the to the cult of the following fire okay I guess I owe you guys telling you at some point but yeah we'll talk later all right and that is where we're gonna end for tonight
