Vitruvius the light at its hearth the altar at the center of it still unlit the great claw of the dragon organize resting in the brazier unlit as our hero's retreats now the new Lord Commander veo Senya back to the Clocktower of Drakon hime with now with the now lieutenant commander Elias Drexel and queen Leonor and the representatives of the amethyst Academy where you make camp for the night before progressing back to your next objective in the city of Dragon I'm as you part ways looking out as the paladins and the night captain Theodore marshal and Ophelia read look with the mournful gaze of the decisions made in the chamber the regret on Elias drechsel's face at being exposed by the queen of Thieves and the grim determination in the face of Lucretia Matthias and the followers of the falling fire as they continue to I the grand Cathedral as all shuffle out and go their separate ways you progress with a skeleton crew of hooded lanterns and the watchful thud of Eldrick rune Weaver's shield guardian part of your and rivers flaming sword bearing bodyguard you head back to the Clocktower not not this one no I'm not River rivers build an armored bodyguard yeah that also has a flaming sword they both have filling swords is it Ignatius I'm your bodyguard Lord warlord you'll get used to it you make camp at the clock tower which has now become a makeshift barracks really at the ground level given how many hooded lanterns are now using it as a staging ground for their own operations was there anything you'd like to do before you pass the night um I want to go to the top of the tower can say I want to go upstairs and I want to watch the the different factions as they move through the city yeah it's kind of an eye gaze longingly I find a snack as night descends on the city of course from the top of the clock tower gazing down into the city streets and looking out across Drakon Haim the haze and the mist fills for the streets and you can see the spires and rooftops and steeples of the various buildings poking through the fog that hangs over the city out as far as the city walls which almost contain this fog like a bowl of pea soup from the clock tower you can see the lights still shining at temple gates and at the barracks at Shepherds gate and the various lights that dot the abbey of or the asylum rather of Saint Salinas across from the crater and of course the looming shadow of both Castle Drakken and the great tower of the amethyst Academy which hang highest over the city itself it's see judging by the progression of the factions pluto if you can give me a perception check you've got a really squint and look out to sea I'm just checking cuz I think yeah it didn't help too much but I got a 12 surveying out from the clock tower you can see that the there's still quite a lot of activity around temple gate and you managed to spy a procession going across champions bridge that's the bridge where we murdered those minotaurs right mm-hmm that's how I know it landmarks in the city it's where I've killed certain things coming into the city room the procession is heading from the north to the south okay so the opposite direction so there's like the meteor they're heading towards the crater yeah okay or the crater assuming that's the following fire is it look like the falling fire of the Paladins so falling fire mm-hmm you can see by the glint of the torches and pitchforks classic does anybody else feel a little weird that uh we fought our way into the middle of the city lost so many people and then didn't light that brazier well I can still go light it but I don't know what's gonna happen like we could just light bones on fire other parts of it yeah I think there was more to it than that I think if the paladin's really wanted it but they would have worked with us what they would have done it yeah they seemed really angry about magic users we didn't make the decision for them not do we just put it out there and they decided they didn't want we tried to ask them to join a three-way deal and they were like nah magic users yeah we put it out there the amethyst Academy was willing to work and I hope you guys understand that decision that I made oh I understand it they were I'm with you cool thank you thank you always support because I'm a great leader better than war master warlord but really I value both your opinions over anybody's in the city so I hope you'll help me in my new role as Lord Commander in order to make sure that our vision what we decided together our goals happen joint to promote us we could be like captain sort of lieutenants do you want to be in the hooded lanterns or you want to be more free-flowing I'm still good with being Sebastian Crowe yeah as long as as long as they listen to me long as they know to listen hello my name is hooded lantern they do yeah they sure look if not send them my way yeah you'll put them in line I will give them their afternoon snack that I'll show them yeah already when you arrive at the clock tower the few hooded lanterns that were still stationed there Elias Drechsel gives them the debrief on what has happened and they are very and several of the hooded lanterns assemble at the base level of the clock tower to salute and acknowledge you as the new Lord Commander and thank you thank you and it basically consists of a they they salute they place their hands on their hearts and they reaffirmed their dedication to the throne of West amar and the city of Drakon hime as long as they still draw breath and I do the same and I say I appreciate your support but we're all here to support each other we're here to make sure that the throne survives and that Drakon hime can be a city once more that we are proud to live in as normal people appreciate it I use minor illusion to make somebody in the back row go yay new Lord Commander and let me send them clapping well thank you thank you there's a weary cheer that rises up from the hood of lanterns and a fair amount of confusion as well amongst them but the discussions through the night bring them up to speed on what has happened and many of them are shocked by it they the tales of vales exploits and skill have risen through the ranks and so to hear of another capable warrior now being the leader of the hooded lanterns and that the fact that and there's there's a few people also that now that they've heard well actually that's a good question do you want to explain to the soldiers of the hood of lanterns why Elias Drexel has been removed as low commander I want to explain that it was for a reason from his past and we need no more discuss it okay it is for a good reason and the Queen made her decision to make a change in command that doesn't mean that he is not one of us and that he is not part of the city as an important leader within the community he offers much wisdom and experience but we also need new direction and are ready to move forward as a new hooded legends later in the evening Elias Drexel does come up TV oh and he says I really appreciate that you didn't tell the soldiers what I did some of them know some of them were part of it like I said it's it's in the past and as long as you are solid in your conscience of what your role is in the city we can move forward as partners in this I stand beside you it I plan to spend my life faithfully in the service of the throne and the city as do I we are aligned on this there's a matter though that we should think about without the support of the silver order and I respect your decision the night captain and his men were capable soldiers soldiers that we needed with the wounded the dead and the weary we don't have enough soldiers to hold on to what we've secured sometimes in order to go ahead we got to take a few steps back I agree we need to make sure that we're securing what we had and if the soldiers of the the falling are sorry the hooded no sorry the shiny guys the shiny guys if they're gonna make trouble in the city then we need to make sure that our positions that we do have are fortified I'll send some scouts to keep an eye on them I don't find out what their movements are as it is little we can maintain our outpost here at the clock tower and but if we want to maintain this place as well as keep an eye on the cathedral and temple gates we're gonna be stret far too thin do you want me to have everyone pull back to the barracks I think that'd be the wisest choice now and we can evaluate our position we can do some Scout who can do what we do best and figure out how the city's gonna move now that the pieces have been played on the board I think we're not on dis friendly terms with the Paladins but that doesn't mean they're gonna stay friendly with us based on what happens I think with the cathedral so I think the best thing we can do is sit and watch and play our cards when they're meant to be played let's fortify the Clocktower our place in the city or we can at least make some leeway fortify the barracks and we'll keep an eye on the gate okay I'll send a runner and we'll get that going tonight sounds good is Eldrick with us as well yep divert the Queen can I talk to the two Eldrick and River yep all right I wanted to was I privy to this conversation at all between the Lord Commander I think word he approached veo privately okay but veo can bring you up to speed if she wants to die well so then I I want to approach Eldridge and River and just our next our next mission is going to be to take the the amethyst Academy tower if we can secure that tower that gives us a way to push forward and re-secure parts of the city right we're not going to lose everything we just fought for we might lose the Cathedral I imagine but we did a lot of cleaning up make no mistake the tower of the amethyst Academy is the single most precious and powerful resource in this entire city next of course to the Delirium itself the tower of the amethyst Academy has stood here before even the amethyst Academy was formed it is an ancient building it was built even before the castle and this stood for hundreds of years the knowledge and resources that we will be able to bring back once we have secured it will give us every advantage that moved see you don't think there's any loss in the silver order leaving us now you do have to understand that they were great knights and soldiers that were fighting on our side they were we've taken a step backwards by letting them go and I hope we made the right decision I hope you know I made that decision because I I trust you you understand of course that one of the most important resources that we have not had part of the reason why we have not been able to make a foothold here in Drakon Heim as the Academy individually because something has happened to the teleportation circle that is located in the day Academy tower once that teleportation circle is reactivated we will be able to bring resources from all the other towers across the entire continent dragon right I just hope the teleportation circle wasn't on one of the floors that's missing me to question for the uninitiated right were you here the whole time I'll save it no no no go ahead you were standing nearby and I just didn't pay attention I just I step up if that teleportation circle gets active could things in the tower also go all around the world our teleportation circles require a mage of significant power to be able to open the Gateway from that location to the circle their destination points and landing pads they do not necessarily connect things outwardly that would not be able to the problem is and the Academy has known this for us quite some time is that the Hays has a shall we say unpredictable effect on teleportation magic over long distances about 14 years ago when this disaster first occurred a survey team attempted to teleport into the tower if you can find what's left of them we would be very interested to know what happened I'll see what we can find in the morning I am gonna go just make sure my family is okay in the time since others who have attempted to teleport to the circle who still know the code to teleport into that circle have found themselves teleported outside the city they have found themselves on the other side of the world in a different tower entirely and other more unfortunate ones found themselves rebounded to locations within the haze itself hence it has been an unreliable and dangerous method of travelling into the city and we don't know why we won't know why into how we secure the circle again that is but one of many important resources that you will be responsible for when you head back into the Academy tower should I try not to blow things up when I'm in there the Academy towers have withstood the unfortunate experimentations of mages far more foolish than yourself Sebastian there can't be that many but thank you how I'll keep that in mind I hope we made ad sense we can discuss this more but you need to understand that there are secrets in the Academy tower that should not get out into the world at large there's anything I'm good at it's not telling people's secrets and for your companions it is very important that you focus on the objective at hand when you were in that tower and don't get distracted by things like the libraries and the workshops and laboratories and the vaults the three of us are very focused we rarely get sidetracked we we set out to do missions and we do them flawlessly River rolled her eyes and last I always have to pay attention I'm sure we can count on you guys we can't screw this one up I'm under a lot of pressure will discuss more as we prepare the Academy has sent us a few other resources that will help us secure the tower that we can turn over to you a bomb not about you know what don't give us a bomb we screwed up with the last bomb but I promise if you gave us another bomb we wouldn't lose it don't eat like honestly if we get another bomb the queen of Thieves is just gonna like show up and be like give me that bomb and we're gonna be like well just turn it on and die get my friends you know I want you to understand that I'm not entirely disappointed with what happened with that bomb when we gave you that bomb we told you to let chaos reign in the city and what greater agent of chaos exists in this city than the queen of Thieves I would say and the council agrees that in a funny way you exceeded expectations like I said laser focus in tomato plan Oh Eve thinks herself to be a brilliant plotter and a master of politics but she has a thing or two to learn about the this Academy I like it I feel good well that's nice today the time for a nappy now nailed it yeah totally nailed it you guys gonna have a nap nap here if you want I mean you've already set up camp I assume you're staying the night yep they do we'll be upstairs we sleep in the same room in the bed we share we share a large bed upstairs we're just more comfortable that way it's middle it's just how it's always worked out girl at the end of the bed all right with that morning comes and you begin to set out Eldrick and River will journey with you towards amberwood village which is your next destination correct yes yeah got to make sure that the crows are okay top of carrot top and the rest of the redhead fans I'm assuming they are cuz it wasn't the Queen that said that it was either the knight commander of the Lord Commander had said what makes you think that they wouldn't go after your family which is really a freaky thing to hear yeah the Lieutenant Commander will take a few soldiers and the Queen back to the barracks as well yeah part of the Queen Lenore herself is extremely distraught and she has not said much since some of the revelations earlier about the fact that her daughters are still missing it at large but she's very quiet and she often has her hands against her head kind of you can hear her muttering under her breath I need to remember I need to remember do we still have the photos we still have all of the documents we still have the the sealed will the sealed will the family tree the photos we have a lot of like very important evidence out of a diary I know the wedding photo of her son I want to take that and give it to her and just say I remember milady there is always still hope for the future and hand it to her thank you the hell you can't see her face under the mask so it's difficult to see to read the expression but it seems like her voice breaks at the end of the sentence we're off to make sure that our next move is going to be the most beneficial for Dragon home do you have enough of the potion to sustain you I do okay we'll be off and I take a large bow good hunting or commander and idea do the salute which route are you gonna take back to ember wood village let's yeah so let's go out the the barracks gate and then your long mountain long way around yeah I think we might have to not trusting the I don't trust the other key unless you think we should go there we need to get there fast I would like to get there fast I'm pretty consistent we can skirt by the outside of the like stay along the wall and skirt by the outside the other gate to take a look we still own champions way yeah we could go through champions way follow the think sound falling fire or is that well we'll see people could we could well champions gate is still held by the followers the falling fire and you need to travel through the the crater oh right it was temple gate that we are yeah okay well we could try leaving through temple gate yeah that's our fastest way we'll see if they let us through they don't get a backtrack you head through the Miss riddled streets of Drakon hymen which are quieter than they ever have been before there are still once in a while you catch a glimpse of scattered Knoll and you can see through the streets that they oh as you lead the group through you catch more glimpses of rattling along the streets than you ever have before feasting on what corpses they can find from the carnage of the past couple days we got rid of one vermin and now another is overpopulating I mean at least we we know them look at one of the rats I'm like hello rattling no they don't seem as friendly as usual and I yeah okay very lordly there are many many of the rap folk or this Bracken Haim and probably many more than just the ones that follow the so called rad prints mmm good day welcome after it convert them expand his kingdom yeah well you be now better off as you head back through the city streets towards temple gate and a long Temple row from the market you can see as you approach temple gate that the banners of the silver order fly over the gates I'm not surprised by this our old pals I mean you know we're still friends right we're still on good terms so I put out on bad terms we're not on great terms we did pull our forces back though to the other gate so I mean hopefully the lettuce fruit let's give him a hi how are you don't worry guys I have a plan I step forward and I yell can we go through hello it's Sebastian Crowe coming up from the ramparts as you approach closer you can see that they've set up several like tents and whatnot in inside the city walls and from the from the towers of the gatehouse one of the paladin's looks down and says I recognized you three and the other friends you got with you you can come out this way you can't come back in why not is it an emergency exit orders are orders I mean that's just mean we have other ways into the city you're basically just saying that we can't use the front door and we have to go and use the back door inside don't make us walk even further you're fine to risk it however you want but then not not captain's orders say the silver order will let anyone out but nobody in oh okay so maybe it's not biased I mean we can get out the way it's just like it's like a blanket like I don't feel attacked is what I'm saying I don't feel personally yeah it's not personal it's a if it's in everybody statement then I suppose all right sounds great we'll test it later you come back as Cornelius Cornelius yes if they like where Neal is in we know something's afoot yeah well for now for now this is how it'll be we're not here to be enemies we're here to just get on our business I see you down there don't you worry we let your men go in peace they weren't harmed perfect I appreciate that was there another yeah thanks hey thanks thanks for not murdering a bunch of people who helped you anyway things seem a little confusing right now soldier what's your name my name is Marcus Durant I think we might have run afoul of each other once before were you in the the bottle of temple gate I was indeed excellent excellent fighting with you yeah brother in arms he's he's got his violet like the visor of their helmets they have the the salads out how much they were they keep he keeps them down and almost all the other paladin's are and Knights all have their visors down and regard you with almost faceless seriousness I just want everybody here to know that it was a pleasure fighting alongside you guys and you are always welcome here in Drakon hime as our guests bears like nudging you all right well move along now you know we will all the trees are over I guess it's I'll see you at the at the holiday the next holiday usually when somebody says you know was good to fight with you you respond it was good to fight with you two or something none of that no heavy heavy in the air right now civility is what we can expect air seems a little thick here barely civil easy yeah Hays is heavy by this gate hurt do you feel that paladin we do we have to cycle out every day hmm hmm I can't get a good night's sleep down over here oh that's a shame poor you we'll be on our way I walks out and they through the gate you leave you can see that they've taken the steps to fortify their holding here and you have they've they've doubled down they're putting up some new hoardings and making sure that they can the banners are flying quite prominently looks like we have an illusion problem yes for now hopefully and I say this actually really close to Pluto maybe we can rely on having a Caspian problem I thought I was the Caspian oh that's Jupiter you're not a problem oh thanks guys you know what yeah anyway really great I guess we need to find Jupiter at some point because he might have some people to join forces with he might also have one of the badges but at this point if we can get Jupiter on our side I mean I would love caspia on our side yeah I was kind of iffy about it at first but I'm I feel Caspi over Elyria for sure it's pretty easy I mean I have no beef with Jupiter Jones we just kill them and move on yeah I like the meat you did I say kill I meant murder sorry oh so many so cute we'll figure it out when we get there I know lots of people with bows now so don't worry I kid I kid I would never murder lamb but I mean accidents can happen and I won't stop them from happening with that the long journey back to ember wood village taking temple road out of the city and following along the Grand River for a safe crossing and then take it and then heading back across the hills and the roads that lead to that sleep a little hometown of Everwood village you're so at home here as we get close enough to amberwood village I start to run towards my home like like just as you see yeah yeah I want to see visuals like can you see in the distance as when you can read signs it's like you know Sebastian has a relative understanding on how far he can run before Keeling over and it's not that far so it's more like he's walking casually and once he kind of passes the welcome to Everwood Village sign and you're like by the first houses he kind of starts like jog and then he's like okay all right all right and then he picks up speed and he runs up to his house and bursts into the door I'm jogging at a slow jog beside jeeping like we're picking up the pace okay cool cool in the door to catch up there are there is Maire and the children just cleaning up after breakfast are you alive and she has a very shocked look on her face she's like Sebastian and your father's already gone to the blacksmith he's gone man it's past breakfast oh wait sorry say that again he's gone where he's already gone to the smithy to the shop oh he already had breakfast he's but he gets up at the crack of dawn to start work you're okay everything's fine nobody's been here no you haven't been no right and no no strange people about threatening you or there's been a lot of strange people about but that's pretty that's typical for this town at these days yeah maybe we should put a couple of lanterns here I start like investigating around the house just like looking frigging up things and like looking at me I'm like looking under them like kind of Pat down the kids you check behind their ears and they check in their hair being like I looking for like check in the pantry actually I I need a moment and I and I sit there in the house and I do the ritual detect magic aside from a few fragments of delirium that you left here a while ago there's not a lick of magic and what about the harpy egg so magic house the harpy idea we should check in on that have they been nursing it they have been they they've been keeping it in the chicken coop [Music] when that thing hatches oh boy no no it might think that they're its mother it's a good night for children well see oh please we're either gonna learn they're gonna learn some lessons the children are very puzzled by all of this that's going on you're your brother your sisters your brothers actually already at this Mateus as well but and they're very they're they kind of laugh at the situation but do you explain to Moya what do you what do you say oh yeah we distract the kids with magic and I and then we'll take more into the other room marks and I'll stand in the doorway listen we just had a really interesting conversation with a lot of really scary people and it just happened to come up that one of the people that is on our side suggested the idea that if they knew about me having family that my family could be in danger your thoughts her eyes go wide and she says if anyone would be so low to come after your family as long as you're standing out for what's right we'll stand by you and we'll protect this house but we'll do what's right to make sure that my children are safe but you need to tell your father about this so that we can be sure that we're we're gonna be okay they're not gonna come by and like that are they gonna is a house in danger what is the nature of the danger we don't know there's perhaps you've heard whisperings of the queen of Thieves of Drakon home well she's been she's caused all sorts of trouble here at ember wood village with all the gangs I may have pointed a wand at her and threatened her in public how Sebastian [Music] what are we gonna do if she comes around and you're not here I didn't think of that I was trying to do what was right in the moment I saw an opportunity to confront her she has been doing horrible things in Drakon home for a long time and I thought I could put her in her place turns out I didn't quite have the control of the situation I thought I did we're making some major moves right now to gain some power and reclaim as much of Dragon hime as we can but the queen of Thieves may be an enemy now she's always been an enemy but now that she's she's always been someone stirring up all kinds of trouble but if she's gonna come after us if she's gonna come after my daughter's my son your father I don't know if she would it was just a suggestion that was made it's a possibility it's something that I can't rule out what are we supposed to do do you have any way to protect this place I don't I don't want to I don't want to tell you to go somewhere else this is I mean this is your home you're not gonna not gonna make you leave I just feel like if you knew if you know about the danger then maybe there's something we can we don't have anywhere else to go [Music] Cluedo both your father's family and my family have lived here in number wood village for generations it's not like we can pack up and move somewhere else I'm scared it's the first time in my whole life that I've actually had a family to come home to I had my dad before but you have to understand that I was young and things were awkward things are better now it's it's it's this is what I always wanted I always wanted to come home to this and I don't want to lose that well sit down we'll fix some lunch lunch and your father will be back and then we can discuss what we can do okay my kids go chase the butterflies and I minor illusion them to chase the butterflies like I heard there was lunch did you just like pop into the kitchen at this like you didn't hear anything else you just heard the word lunch day I was caught up in Eldrick and River have as well and seeing this Eldrick speaks up and he says well Moyer is a very good cook and I think that it's only fair that if wherever and I can park our carriages here and have lunch we'll do our best to keep an eye on things would you do that for me yes we'll stay here for the time being Maire does that sound they're the most powerful mages I've ever met and more more and odds they've been company here before so it just means you got to deal with those two things don't we she points to the shield Guardian and I look up to the shield Guardian I'm like do you eat I don't think you have to worry about it looks down at you with its helmeted head I mean you don't have to feed them and I mean really they're some of the best protection you can ask for we'll be fine I think your force comes to worse that's great would we be willing to if things go really bad would caspia be a safe place for them yeah I guess anywhere far away at least until we deal with the threat whether it be from the queen of the user someone else now that would be a journey that would take the weeks but if this place ever became unsafe i would always offer refuge in caspia i don't think it's something that they need to endure right now but i think if this place becomes some more that is truly unsafe for them and we cannot guarantee their safety I think making the journey to Castilla might be the best option for making sure both the families are safe yeah totally I would never never scoff at that idea my family would welcome them at least I would hopefully write a letter and be like yo guests are coming it's Pluto sorry I don't write much 100 men still going strong yeah and your breathing's fine what do you want to send no do you want to send a message out to anyone in caspia wow I never even thought of that I really I'm really bad at sending letters you're waiting probably so worried about you you keep bringing up this like are you and yeah you know what's what do you have a wife it's uh maybe I should reach her to family back home so invasive we've been friends for like a month now yeah like I just I've just been so preoccupied with like not dying that writing letters just forgot all about the people in your past and your if you need to send your letter to someone in caspia I can relay it that'd be great I'll draft something up you have 25 words oh yes telegram I need to know who you'd be sending it to and I can make the arrangements that it is delivered okay I know so many I just I turn away in stir scribbling okay on some loose paper with that your father returns in the afternoon and you're able to explain the situation to him and as Eldrick makes the next preparations for your expedition to the tower you guys are going to have a couple days of downtime what would you like to do um well I'm sure I'll be busy relaying messages to the squads to let them know what the plans are okay I also want to just practice my archery okay I always get better at what you're good at you know yeah well you got you leveled up as well I think we went over this last time you've got another level of rope right another level of drogue sonam fourth level rogue and I actually put my foot my longbow and I start to really practice with my crossbow trying to like get faster it like putting in the bolts and like firing them so I use a couple target practice like blue you're working on your your message yes okay I'll come back to you Sebastian what are you gonna do Irie summon karoli finally and I begin flipping through my mom's spell book again trying to learn some of the ones that I've been practicing for a little bit as well as coming back constantly to that page that I didn't see before with the contact other plain spell and I start trying to figure that out okay and I imagine that I spent quite a bit of time in the evenings and mornings and if I'm up through the night and flipping through the book to that page practicing it in order for you to master the ritual and their other rituals that you want to scribe into your book yeah so I was hoping that I could take comprehend languages is one of the ones that I scribing them into the book and its hella Pathak bond okay those are all available for you too pop in the process of copying each spell you need fifty gold pieces and materials to copy each per level of the spell so for telepathic bond and contact on a plane you'll need 500 gold pieces of materials which Eldrick is able to provide you with at the cost but you need to pay for it yeah so it would be a total of 650 err sorry five hundred and fifty gold pieces to do all three and it will take you approximately three days to finish mastering Mol's rituals that's what I'm going to do with my downtime then is I I really think that contact with my mother is its the top priority for me cool so as you're working Eldrick does take notice of what you're of that you were working on arcane rituals and he explains do you remember some of your early lessons little yeah when you become a member of the Academy one of the things that we will teach you is how to practice circle magic that is magic that is performed in tandem with another caster show me the most powerful spell you are capable of casting I have been working on a but a few new ones do you want to see yeah I kind of I stared Eldrick for a few moments and transform both of our appearances so that he looks like Sebastian Crowe and I look like Eldrick well done well done boy it's funny voice coming from Sebastian well I'm aldrick we have a tradition amongst full members in the Academy and he holds up his hand and he shows the rings that he wears on each finger these are my rings and he holds up his second hand and you see that on one hand he has five rings and on the other hand he has two you own a ring in accordance with the greatest magic you have mastered and he points to River who holds up her hand that has four rings on it you have damn River well river petty I didn't see that one coming she smiles hold on Thanks it's it always amazes what the raw talent can master somehow even though you have not had the tutelage and the learning in the instruction there's some real talent in you thank you I've been working real hard trying to I don't know make sure that I I do okay with this like obviously you know my past with magic was not the most controlled no but you are the son of Lana the Eventide who wore ten rings Wow I have one ring right now it's pretty cool actually I think it was one of hers well you'll have to prove worthy of it thank you so much I I walk up to him like a bug can you do this and I like shower sparks in my prestidigitation hey hey you best be careful but with with that veil it is one thing to know minor tricks and con traps and show them around it's another to be cursed with sorcery as someone like Sebastian or the rest of us are for most people they can't tell the difference between the different forms of magic and well the things being as they are over the past couple days this situation in Drakon hime could cause problems that shake across the whole world if the silver order brings their news back to the high arc of the Church of the sacred fire they could open up the discussion of the edicts of lumen which protect us as those who have sorcery in our blood there were dark times in the days before the Academy and we rely on a very careful agreement between the church and the nations of the continent in order to protect ourselves we need to tread very carefully he still looks like Sebastian Crowe this one time so what you're saying is only invisible mage hand no I'm saying we'll see what happens in far-off places ok Pluto I I don't remember my dad's name is Saul perfect I don't say that out loud hmm I just sit there and I go and as I'm scribbling I'm like you know when you like the the word likely and you're like trying really hard and like salt this is called him dad he's always just been dad or father Bahji I run into the room and I'm just like I'm done and I and I am oh it can I do it privately yep I'm gonna go up to Eldrick and I want it like right now I look like L tray looks like Sebastian so I walk up to you and hello Pluto I am Eldrick I have a cold I'm ready to send my message and let's hear it I'm just looking at it with the most wide eyes like a magic cat eyes I have secured the documents Queen Lenore is alive but sick children missing need to possibly shelter refugees i also made new friends miss you excellent I will send this at once it's to my father salt ah yes here you go Sebastian wait why are you giving it to Sebastian he is the best mage here Sebastian Crowe greatest mage in the world could you have done this the whole time Sebastian Eldrick just kind of shakes his head i transform back what yeah alright who do I have to kill magic infuriates Sebastian when playing tricks on you oh you learned from the best I will relay this as quickly as I can thank you very good get some rest and your spell will be having you don't trust anything anymore sneaky the start of the new week will start on our expedition sounds good is there anything else you'd like to do with your downtime you spend - I'm gonna say that you spend about two weeks mm-hmm a vacation we're racking up them days so we've really earned them any health potions we can buy I can also make some potions yeah Sebastian can make them can you make me some potions how already I want to make myself more delirium potions okay and more health potions for the group okay so Sebastian you can now create over the course of your downtime you Eldrick will also instruct you on how to create aqua delirium on how to create aqua exper go and how to make potions of greater healing so you can do healing potions greater healing potions and the two different delirium potions does the aqua despair go still need to be injected into the chest or can I try to come up with an easier method of consumption yeah give me an hour count check [Music] fifteen well you spend a couple days planning with it with a suppository and that goes nowhere nowhere good at least test subject working with Albert and River and with a few more instructions that come in and materials they come in there's there's a runner that comes one day from the Academy that brings materials and there is now an aqua a exper go that can be taken orally that you can drink yes Pluto still bad effects is it still have the same side effects it does okay that's fair and it tastes really bad it's it's kind of like you know like the most vile shot you can imagine like it's like that combination of like absinthe and brine and that's what it tastes like but could I press this is like pickled right because that's how anxious you don't try to cry it's it might you know the the magical confluence means that when you press it educate it it changes its flavor randomly Pluto do you agree to be the test subject I do only because this way I can actually take my armor off and I can just lay in the bathtub so for three or four days I'm feeding Pluto these potions and he's until he gets it right mass yeah he's just I have I am strong this improved aqua ex ex Peugeot fortunately only results in vomiting unfortunately that's a great that's attacking you I'm like it only came at one end flute oh we're making bro as you develop it Eldrick explains it's better than the alternative yeah actually nowhere few places in Drakken Heim are thicker with the haze and perhaps greater quantities of delirium than the grounds near the Academy Tower so you will all need to imbibe it Oh to approach the house that's fair it will probably kill you otherwise okay and hopefully the tower is sealed enough that once you're inside you will be shielded from the effects we're really counting on that one well do you have anything to go on or is that just like a hopeful the towers are the amethyst academy have endured much magical disaster but it is entirely possible that there could still be problems because of course you have seen what happened to the tower when the meteor fell we really do not know what state it will be in we have long pondered this but we don't know for sure when you go the teleportation chamber is one of the most important objectives you can secure it is located on the first level below the main level in the main level is on the ground floor like proximately yeah like walking in off the streets or the circles on in the basement indeed do we also want to go up because this the circle is located in the basement because the rest of the tower is traditionally shielded against being entered or exited with magic okay it is incredibly likely that the Guardians that are kept in the tower and the various creatures that we use to maintain our towers will still be there but with 15 years of no maintenance the binding rituals that are typically performed on an annual basis who have expired leaving them wild and untamed everywhere that we go in Drakon time it's just wild and untamed is actually a great description for most of this city yeah yeah and that's why we're ready for it how many potions can I say how many one per day okay yeah one per day and you can then and then that also includes the days so you have to spend at least three days mastering the rituals and one day mastering the mastering the potions themselves and then after that so you can make 10 potions of any type that you'd like that's actually greater here I'm amazing I'm gonna make myself quite a few so a real roll call I have three potions of greater healing currently I have zero I make a zero I'm gonna make five potions of greater healing I take how many Henry how many do you have right now right now as long as we have a good spread because we can always change it up later yeah I have one potion of greater healing I think that makes sense we all have three it should be three four or five yeah let's do that that's actually yeah solid there is another objective that you will have once you are in the tower you will need to find at the top of the tower who is the Nexus so Nexus is the focusing lens which Orient's the ley lines around dragon hime and allows members of the amethyst Academy to tap in one of our most of into one of our most valuable resources the well of all spells whoa apart in order to secure the Nexus it is also what controls the other arcane defenses of the tower you will need to override whatever magic is in place in the Nexus and the only way that you will be able to do that is by finding the staff of power of the Archmage of the academy wherever that staff of power lies you will need it to reorient the Nexus and that's in the tower I hope to all the gods and all the winds of magic that it is so secure the basement find the staff of power override the Nexus correct and see gains against once you override the Nexus any of the defenders that have been gone haywire or any of our other servants or other spells that would be attuned to the former occupants of that tower will then recognize you and you will be able to specify their parameters Oh once you have done so you will return the staff of power to the council seems fair it seems fair yeah cuz he has a wand he doesn't need a snap for power dad one hour now you have to go to the council to do it or can you deliver the powered staff to the council I think our presence is best here no hopefully once you secure the teleportation circle the council will be able to come here don't do well with teleporting so afterwards Sebastian yes if you are interested in being considered for the stewardship of the tower that is something that may be considered once you demonstrate that you have attained your seventh ring okay right now I have one ring do I get more well judging by what I've seen of you over the past two days you were inducted you would earn your fifth ring higher in the river river can be my number two number three Thanks one are you ranking us right now one shall be my number two they're my number one you're my number one shall be my job finally like your friends Vale Pluto you are an exception we normally do not permit those who are of more mundane persuasions from even entering the upper reaches of the tower of the amethyst Academy with respected AO your talents are admirable but amateur I picture BeOS eating and I'm like gazing off in the distance well he's like basically making fun of us and I'm just staring I can't do it without them I understand that we don't expect you to listen as I've heard a halfling say before two magical people you can keep your secrets we appreciate you may see some things in that tower that you do not understand coffins are quite often the spatial dimensions inside the tower might not necessarily conform to what you expect said anything like where I went to school as you as you'll see apprentices typically keep to the lower reaches of the towers but the higher reaches are anyone's game okay we have a plethora of magical items and abilities how do they interact in a tower that is sort of protected spatially dimension yeah and it's got protections that are going wild in a normal normal functioning tower of the Academy they are augmented and even boosted many arcanists that were working together in one of the foundries of an academy tower the members of the academy can work amazing feats of magic that a single mage working on their own or even a mage group of mages working outside the tower could not even fathom it's the benefits of working together we understand this very well in the academy but the influence of the haze of delirium may have caused all these things to go haywire if the behavior of the teleportation circle is any indication you will want to exercise caution I'm just thinking for things like keep that dimension doors or yeah I don't think we can go out of the tower through teleportation once we're in so once we're in we're in we're in hmm no I know I'm here shoot at running also I'm not running I'm not comfortable with running it's too heavy my stuff's too heavy especially since you're carrying half of my stuff yeah do you have a new bag by the way I don't think I'm getting mine back we lost a bag of holding to the Queen we'll see what we can do about that I mean he was there I saw where I'm storing some stuff in your house during the week Elena shows backup that one of the barracks in with almost no memory of the past several weeks with an empty bag of holding and it makes it waits for the turned it over and all that's inside the bag of holding is an envelope and inside the envelope are is a pressed flower and a smiley face well she did say she was gonna give me my bag back that's true she did so your stuff back does that mean that she's like proving to be of her word no she lied to us so many times never mind she's still back do you have any questions about a tower before you proceed no it seems pretty straightforward kill our way through and when you say override the Nexus I'm assuming that I'll know how to do that when I get there there will be a point that you will the Nexus itself is a great arcane engine attached to a series of lenses okay the control point for it will be marked with runes that will conform to the staff of power when it's presented from there if I am understanding the instructions correctly as you grip that staff of power and adjust it you may be temporarily conscious of the entire universe all at the same time huh is that a good thing or is there possibility that my head explodes I really hope that your head does not explode we do if his head explodes is there a way for you to put it back together like this is his head exploding and then it comes back together I'm a wizard not a cleric do you know of any yeah I'm a Mason I need it if it's anything like masonry I've got this I don't think it is I feel so much safer hmm actually I do have one other question for Sebastian yes so you made three five potions of healing we need at least one each of the Iowa I took that into account so I had to aqua exper Gia so I made one more okay I had one aqua delirium so I made four more okay and then I so that's 5 and then a 5 I'll see you so we'll have at least one each to take before we get to the tower yes finally I noticed that you've mastered the ritual of a telepathic bond yeah I will take point and if you would like when we set out you myself and River will enact the ritual together which will increase the duration and distance by which we can maintain that telepathic bond so you will be able to be in contact with myself and River well you explore the tower should you have encounter any problems amazing is so fun yeah I never you know it didn't occur to me until this conversation that I could have friendship to enhance spells having other spell casters around is great what yeah the circle magic of the Academy allows some of what you do on your own this meta magic which is very brilliant technique that not many can master but circle magic allows several majors working together to manifest similar effects in shaping their spells wonderful mega magic mega magic it's done some terrible things throughout history I can imagine oh but it's also allowed us to talk yeah we need call signs I'm silver eagle oh I like that I'm Sebastian Crowe now you need it oh I'm Ellie mix velcro that was my first one you came up with call sign Shadowcat but that's like literally my name - shadow Crowe damn this isn't working guys Pluto call sign for me go oh wait I've got one I've got one way I don't know I'm gonna call you fire starter fire starter codename fire starter fire starter Silver Eagle like the family of crows and shadow cat yes shadow cat shadowcat Alley Cat Panther shadow Panther Panther shadow guy so I'm gonna forget all these I'm calling your Pluto in jail okay I'm just I just want to make elder regret you're having a telepathic box I already do just constantly I'm innocent all of your no indicate if you wish to have to talk telepathically we'll just Institute a rule that you need to put your fingers to your forehead sign that you were talking to about that the Mike Shanin Pluto's still gonna screw this up and he's just gonna be walking around like this for getting his hands are up there and just being like what did I have for breakfast if I do - yeah that's how I actually think a lot get off the line we'll see how that goes just static so of a static is is that it for the two two weeks yeah cool I guess yeah I don't have much to do on my down time so I'm just like I'm you have a because just constantly walking around like wondering what you guys are doing oh you're shooting at me yeah okay I'll try to practice yep and I'm just learning how to deflect with my shield mm-hmm it's against each other at long distances oh that's great yeah perfect great for me cool cool the only news from the wider world that you receive over the past two weeks is that a diet of the flame keepers has met in lumen and declared that Lucretia Matthias is an outlaw and a heretic and those that follow her are subject to church law mm-hmm like or like Church law or like Church law Church law all the above and so there have been rumors breaking out and reports from the scouts of the hooded lanterns of battles being fought between members of the silver order and the followers of the falling fire in the streets of Dragonite that's nuts that's chaos I mean maybe they'll take care of problems and kill each other that's horrible I like the silver order I mean this is a little order are good people but they're putting up their boundaries and they're not trusting enough people so if they lose people from all sides they've got obviously the Academy on one and with us they've got the falling fire on another they're not really putting themselves in a good position I also feel bad for all those people are chose to follow Lucretia they're just misguided they they're all digging their own graves I guess it could come in handy though if we ever need to leverage some support from the silver order if we can show that we also do not enjoy the falling fire thank you maybe we can get help get passage back into the city or maybe I know we have passage into the city I wouldn't worry too much about it the enemy of our enemy is our friend I don't think they're our enemy right now but they're not helping themselves they're creating more on each side then they can deal with but if that's what they choose that so they choose we all make our choices in Drakon home and let the cards fall where they may the fish bones make shapes what's the worst later - hey don't say that hey you never know it could be really bad at all I don't like you saying that makes me really uncomfortable man just you've been in my head all day should we head out tomorrow for the tower I want eggs for breakfast before we leave for the tower and toast and bacon and sausages you get all those things and that's where we'll take our break up and

ruins we are indeed after several weeks of rest and relaxation recuperation research potion brewing and training our heroes are venturing back into the ruins of dragon jaime we will take ourselves ahead now to the map of the city where we can plot our route for it is not a big stretch it's not a big journey but a perilous one at that for the academy tower lies at number 10 on the map which is actually in the direct line from market gate from Shepherds gate almost a straight shot from Sir Robert scheppers gate lies there so in fact every time you walked out from that tower as you had a long Sheppard's way you can see it looming straight in front of you in fact it slightly blocks the view of the castle from the barracks and so it is a pretty easy shot if you want to take the most direct route possible from I assume the barracks yeah that would make the most sense I say that we skirt around the outside to Shepards way and then head straight down tower um at this stage the the hooded lanterns have developed basically the pathway that they take when they try to send runners back to ember wood village and their methodology basically is they stay completely outside the ruins of the city they have a crossing a little ways down the drain river that they use instead it takes longer but it's way safer than cutting through the ruins if your interest is safety and not saving time and in fact in some cases it's both the safest and fastest route because going through the ruins can be an ordeal in itself our Eldrick and River more comfortable taking that route Eldrick and River are going to stay in ember wood village as you recall they are going to make sure that your your family is has anion kept on them and in the morning before you set out Eldrick in ax the ritual with you it takes an hour to perform with River instead of just an extra 10 minutes on top of the telepathic bond but the result is is that the telepathic bond that you build with eldritch River and I assume every these two will last for 24 hours so time is of the essence ultra can you hear me sorry I need loud and clear now I will say it is possible we might get a little bit of a shaky reception once we're in the tower into with the Nexus down you know the the proper channels aren't necessarily in place so we'll see what happens and we'll play it by mind instead of ear I see what you did there I'm laughing in my head and it is a party line the the telepathic bond or Jeep I need to decide what my ruling on that is going to be is the telepathic bond a party line or can you salmon tuna yeah I need to bring veo salmon all of us I have this creepy yeah so I'm gonna say because the spell doesn't specifically decide you are linked to each other but you can broadcast to everybody or to one person if you need to so you can broadcast amongst yourselves or everybody as a whole Pluto tuna I have a craving for tuna Pluto Sebastian Fortuna and as you said out Eldrick and River say and some other private thought Eldrick and river be before you head out one last time Elgar can River do have a few things to give each of you as a token to protect yourselves first they give each of you a potion of superior healing you know me and two and then they have three more potions that they can give you that you can use however you like a potion of invisibility a potion of invulnerability and a potion of flying a flying would be super which do you want I don't know who do you think would get them visibility me I was thinking invisibility and vulnerability and flying but I could do I could do flying I could do invulnerability I could go either way where do you want mm-hmm I've already had invisibility at one point do you want to fly oK we've divvied it up and with that as you travel back towards Drakon hime the city looming in the distance and head to work down Shepards way towards the gate and the barracks the soldiers of the hooded lanterns saluting Vale as Lord Commander as they pass through thank you Elias Drexel pax Petra and Ansem acknowledges as you do I assume over the past two weeks kind of Petra and Ansem have been checking in with you as well they oh so there's been hooded lanterns back in amberwood village and heading back again definitely you opened the gate and the gates from the barracks open up and you stare down Sheppard's way this time not looking towards the city but looking up at the tower of the amethyst Academy that looms before you before I leave the lanterns I go to an Sun and I say I need you to get some information on someone if you can you bet what's your command Jupiter Jones find him will do Juwanna shall we apprehend him arrest him beat him up what do you need to do not beat him up um I mean intimidate him for sure but that um tell him that the Lord Commander requires his presence yeah yeah yeah all right Lord Commander requires will seek him out I mean yeah yeah yeah he'll be Lord Commander he'll be waiting for you here when you return perfect guys are so good at your jobs now dismiss them dismiss them casually have a treat knife lick like a little cookie you're a very different ruler the bakery is will be operating at full capacity so the Lord Commander can give out her commendations things really change just in the past two weeks really put on a lot of weight I imagine that like that was one of your first orders as all the people who like aren't capable of going out into the field are now working in the kitchen to make sure that there's a steady supply of food for you we need to make sure that men are fed yeah with bellies they can't do anything I know from experience Jo Sonya's tenure as Lord Commander was remembered for her mastery of logistics and the culinary arts Wow an army marches on its stomach exactly guys we're going after that Tower yes and what a power indeed it is standing over 700 feet tall the great Tower of the amethyst Academy is a looming spire that Dwarfs the towering buildings of Drakon Heim itself standing taller than the clock tower and the Cathedral and though the castle castle dragon is atop a cliff and it is known for its tall towers and spires but even the tallest point of Castle Drakken it's not quite clear whether it reaches higher in the sky then the tower of the amethyst Academy the tower of the Academy is a great rectangular structure o one that is difficult to say whether the exterior is made of glass stone or metal it is almost like an obelisk reaching up into the sky although there are these buttress it flares out at the base with buttresses and then there are several arches that are carved into the side of it towards the bottom and also again at the along the top where it actually reaches up to what was sensibly where the Nexus gathered energy this kind of spire right up at the top of the building itself and of course the central section of the tower has been shattered burst apart in the middle with pieces of floating debris locked as a frozen in time the moment that the meteor struck it and with a keen eye it almost looks like there might be chunks of delirium and the meteor itself floating in amongst the debris that hovers there but the top of the tower stands in place as if completely unperturbed by the fact that the base of the tower was cut out from under it it's a gap in the rent gap probably about 75 not a hundred feet wide in the center and just floats with nothing holding it up except Dale you've seen this a few times over the past few weeks and it hasn't moved that you've seen there is a rope ladder that has been strung from the top to the bottom or from the bottom to the top and it's been sitting there now for several weeks so it's new edition it was not there before hmm before these game or before before these to be like when you in your early times in Drakon high it was not that it's not there yep so it's a fairly recent addition interesting so somebody's been in that tower where is movement mm-hmm well these we can climb it now well you are you guys ready to venture into some 80 paise I am not really totally prepared for this aqua exposure well I mean we improved it as much as we could it's still not going to be pleasant but it's gonna be more pleasant than when we tested it on Pluto earlier do we know if it's gonna work on me nope I would also recommend you do it on a light stomach we literally just stopped at the hooded Lantern barracks and we all ate four pies each yeah I know I'm gonna regret it mm-hmm all that meringue you guys ready Sean's wrong guy up I meet bikers then dessert like strawberry rhubarb it doesn't make sense that we drink them now before like well I imagine we're wandering up the street yep cheers Cheers cheers guys as the vile liquid heads down your throats you can feel it coursing through your veins which bulge out around you and you shudder and shake as you take the liquid I forgot to use press situation so I like open my mouth I'm like tastes disgusting let me get in there fireball what do you want me to fire bolt it out okay I am now going to roll secretly for the effects last one to six hours perfect guys are on a time crunch end of the felt you should be aware when the aquifer goes effect ends you will be incapacitated for 46 minutes for D 6 minutes as you vomit and you will make a constitution saving throw for each hour you were exposed you will make a constitution saving Stroh based on how many hours you were exposed that then determines the effects that you suffer afterwards so to remember you make one saving throw per hour for each failure you suffer a level of exhaustion but well you are under the effects of aqua exper go you have resistance to radiant damage and you automatically succeed on any constitution saving throws I ask you to make because of the haze cool Caribbean so once we stop like twitching and stuff I'm like okay guys these are only gonna work for a little bit so we need to get into that Tyler get in and find a place to throw up for now as a final option if you take a short rest you can perch and the effects of the Aqua Cooper go end and you suffer the bad stuff then in there if you wish to prematurely projectile vomit noted yeah it's good to be on top of it and no not just happen randomly well I don't know how long it's just gonna last this time I've never tested this formula so sorry oh stealthy or as fast as humanly possible let's get in wait do you want to be magically selfie angle fast yes let's do it cool I cast oh that's a little trace okay stay within 30 feet of me and as a group we start moving okay if you want to move with stealth but also be fast you will effectively be moving at normal pace and you'll make your style check with disadvantage even though you have the benefit of postulate race which will still give us a +10 on disadvantage which is fine yeah okay trust me it's fine everything disadvantages fine so you are going to sneak through I have many ruins of the Academy district towards directly towards the tower yeah yeah okay so effectively making a beeline through the streets beeline through the streets okay you can all give me a stealth check with disadvantage with disadvantage but a +10 bonus 24 okay 18:22 okay and all of you can roll me a d6 please one for two as you head through streets and the haze sets in around you you begin to see the cobblestone streets of the Academy district are thick with the haze in fact you can only ever see about maybe 60 to 70 feet ahead of you you can always look up and see the academy tower but the mist hangs heavy in the streets itself unveil as you make pace taking point I assume yep give me a perception check twenty-eight okay you see them but they don't detect the rest of your group lumbering through the haze our four hulking creatures they look like they might have once been odors but their flesh has been stripped and stitched apart and each of them has an extra pair of arms jutting out of their shoulder blades all of them look like someone that they looked dead you can see almost immediately these havoc are undead creatures hmm but someone has modified them deliberately for there are pieces of metal that are going up their spines and across their chests and clamping these extra arms sometimes there are only a human arm one of them has a horse leg as an extra arm and others they're the extra arms instead of ending in hands just end in like a mace and they're lumbering forward around around the streets almost as if on patrol you catch sight of them narrowly in in the mist and they do not detect your presence what will you do I immediately put my hand up to my head to telepathically say guys we got trouble and is there an alleyway near us at all there are several alley alleys and other passageways this is a narrow street here it's the it's the most direct street that leads to the academy and so as you come up to them they're here at this crossroads but there are several side streets and narrow alleys that you could take the group on I say we're taking the side streets the beeline wasn't working these guys are not will want to come across before we go into this Tower here's a question for you hmm who do we know in the city who likes to modify undead is he's shown his showing himself Oscar that makes me worried yep are you thinking that we should avoid this situation oh yeah let's avoid getting our butts kicked before you can get to the tower we got we gotta use this time that we have Pluto yeah let's go quick I don't want to I want to kill these things I'm just talking oh yeah sorry my radio is that on I whatever it is I want to murder it but I I believe that we need to make our way into the tower quickly we'll come back and find these things need to murder them I want to murder them so bad okay hey don't it's not use our resources we got bigger better things that we can kill them that's our yes sir you're gonna lead the group down one of the side streets yep pass through okay all of you can give me another stealth Jackie with disadvantage yep 31 20 28 okay like ghosts now we are by these mangled and horrific creatures down one of the side streets back towards the Academy I picture fair was able to give us like even like if like a loose stone you're like it would be like yeah there's a rod command like watch out for this thing this is what it's like to be me guys no Pathak bond makes us so much easier okay by the way Eldrick I'm sorry that you're listening in on all this it's okay Dave's right though you don't want to get into too much trouble before you actually get to the tower save your strength I wanted to show you what I could do all right red leader out okay taking that divergent roof you come into the plaza of the Academy tower the Academy tower itself is approximately 150 feet wide it's a square building and it stands surrounded by several buildings that are actually part of the Academy and surrounding the perimeter of the mall is a high wrought iron fence which surrounds the entire perimeter of the Academy grounds for in fact this wrought iron fence borders in the small garden and the yard that surrounds the immediate grounds of the Academy tower for down here for around the tower itself are the campus grounds the cobblestone streets break into this park the buildings surrounding the academy of the tower include a large three-story building that you recognize as the apprentices dormitory where the apprentices would live before being inducted to being full members it's a it's a longer kind of four-story building with very of better construction than most homes in Drakon Heim but compared to the other buildings around it it is this by far the simplest building and part of its roof has collapsed and then it collapses in on itself as a chunk of masonry from the tower above seems to have collided with it exposing and destroying the common room and the dining hall that was part of the residences nearby are a set of workshops and stables that would have been used by the apprentices as well and there is a large rotunda style building that is the public lecture hall and the pub and attach to that building is what is considered to be the public library of the amethyst academy you'll not find a single spell book here before it was open in fact to the public as a gift by the mages of the Academy thirst Academy and at one time it was probably the the greatest lie one of the greatest libraries in Drakon I'm for books of a more mundane nature on topics ranging from fiction all the way to history and engineering and the more mundane Sciences as well there is the remnants of a greenhouse and the overgrown botanical garden and leading through the yard and the gardens are several trees and rocks and a pathway that leads across all the buildings before winding gently past this large crescent-shaped lake and then up to a set at all set a 20-foot top it's a high set of stairs that lead into the double doors that lead into the Academy tower itself the destruction is clear many of the buildings are collapsed and impartial stays of ruin and there is a plethora of rubble that surrounds the field bits of built buildings the buildings that have broken off it seems like in fact the lake that was here wasn't originally crescent-shaped but in fact it has been dragged out by a large piece of debris that hauled across it the thing will that strikes you is not the destruction but the forest of massive delirium crystals that have grown up around the lake and all through around the band are in fact clinging onto the building you've never seen anything like this in the city before crystals of delirium the size of a person formed in perfect diamond like shapes cut up out of pieces of the of either media or the meteor itself or parts of the amethyst academy building they are reaching their way and growing up the sides of the buildings of the amethyst academy almost like a strange vine and they pulse with arcane energy almost like an overripe fruit and you can hear with the large crystals around here that they are actually resonating in dissonant tones around each other do you guys hear that do you feel that it's magical music there's feels like a storm feels like I don't know feels weird here the crystals shut up out of each other almost like flowers that are blooming if ever you needed proof of Oscar urines theory that the Delirium grows this is it Wow I want to let El jerk know about our findings describing the the the growing crystals and the size of them and the and he was I'm sorry you must not be thinking correctly you how large I take a little offense to you saying I don't think incorrectly but we're gonna pass through that they are the size of a normal person about 3/4 of the size of me and they are surrounding the lake near the tower I you can understand why now the haze is so heavy here absolutely incredible that crystals of that size worried impossible as unfathomable amazing that they should arrive on our doorstep it is important to be sure I'll check I'm feeling really weird right now I feel like I want to go up to them and touch them I feel like I want them I'm tell have they perhaps they had they hold in the ambient energy of the ley lines the towers built over so what's allowed them to grow to this size I feel hungry I mean that's how I always know it's normal I'm feeling more you actually just listening to veio too much yeah sorry sorry projecting maybe it's this whole telepathic thing I don't know no guys you feel the Delirium I feel the Delirium I don't I hear it but I don't I don't feel it as much as I see it it's affecting you soldier yeah it actually makes you sweat a little bit Sebastian like you can feel the tangible no more wet it's almost intoxicating we'll get someone for the way back we'll fill the bag I know that that's not why we're here I just it's weird thank you well we'll figure it out Eldrick here and your team will have lots to explore when we can finally get this thing locked down so we don't really have time to sit and look at these crystals these you get inside so thank you bye hangs up Shadowcat out I don't think you can hang up okay let's keep going guys are you gonna be okay I'll be I'll be fine why why what it's just some big crystals it's no big deal if you really want some delirium we have some in her bag I he wouldn't understand it's not I'm not addicted to delirium like everybody thinks I am I mean I do enjoy the power that it gives me but it's just like it Tunes into the magic that I have in me then and it's like a connection between me and the delirium it's really hard to explain and suddenly it just it feels like it's an extension of me like it's part of me that's a bit weird yeah that's that's that's not ominous at all let's just keep walking into this James and crunch I really don't want to vomit in the middle of I kidding let's keep going guys all right all right okay as you advance up so you're at the edge of the park essentially there you see all all of these crystals that have formed in the lake and the path that winds up from the Academy buildings along the lake and then the the lake itself kind of rests right almost beside the base of the tower itself the pathway light winding up around it to a set of stairs that lead to the tower proper is it still pretty hazy here incredibly but the glow of the delirium is like fog lights so you can see the and the lake itself is almost glittering and there's a faint sheen like in the fog here there are flecks of delirium in the air itself and there's the ozone of the energy that you can smell and feel in the air yeah this can't be good for my lungs yeah probably should probably put on and I pull my scarf yeah put my man can see approximately 90 feet ahead of you so that you had the glow of the crystals to kind of guide your path I stopped for a second and I I kind of look around kind of looking at the ground in front of me looking around I'm looking for signs of movement or signs of footsteps or footprints school make an investigation check 22 nice as you scan around the passage the the pathway you can see clear signs of recent passage coming through this way there are several large footprints and some of them leading away and some of them leading towards and surmising what you look at some of these footprints might have belonged to those creatures that you saw earlier but there's at least judging by what you see there's signs that there could be as many as eight of such these creatures and the boot steps of too much smaller ones as well and a few other there there's two other prominence sets of footprints and the other shuffling footprints as well leading through the mud and the dust of the pathway going forward guys I think somebody's here and I think I have a guess who it might be I think Oscars here I think there's a good chance that we might run into our old friend again lemurs face I mean if he wanted to go after them and apprehend him like a good Lord commander would do we're past apprehending him right yes he doesn't get away another time just tell me which way to point my bow I know one way neck you know you know follow your heart I normally try to follow my stomach you know that's how we got through the Cathedral well guys I can't think of a more vile treacherous place for Oscar yarn to hang his hat than in a sea of giant delirium crystals I'm worried what he's seen here though the amethyst academy has many secrets and he knows his way around here well there's one way to make sure he doesn't tell those secrets stepheson stop talking Pluto after all this time I'm sure you want to put yourself what a cube yeah you've been training for weeks and weeks just to murder Oscar yo I'm ready I'm ready to help I mean it could be somebody else but there's Undead about there's footprints this all looks very reminiscent of one we tracked him does it look reminiscent of when we tracked them last there's no kart tracks yeah just the boot prints of these large creatures and and they are you examining them with Sebastian these are definitely undead creatures mm-hmm several the the shuffling of the feet zombify people yeah um yeah these are definitely shall we press on let's go yeah let's do it do you follow the tracks or the path to the tracks go a different direction they go along the path well then I'll follow yes the tracks and the path and luckily with passo trace we don't leave tracks ourselves did you come along the pathway you come to the last Bend by the by the lake the humming of the delirium fresh ringing in your ears the smell of ozone and your nostrils and the swirling mist and fog all around you but you can still look up and even here though it's hard to this close to the tower it's hard to look up and see through the fog to see the tower as imposing as it is and as you come up close veil you notice this first at the banks of the river are several pieces of broken glass and several scuff marks and bits of broken stone and a deep gash leading from one of the crystal clusters in the dirt groove carved that goes back from one of the crystals towards the pathway and then up again as if one of the large crystals is no longer there and has been taken into the tower follow that crystal there's definitely been some work in here we should follow the path okay give me a perception check bail 30 okay as you look over towards where the crystal was dragged out you see something in the water it's a set of eyeballs almost looks like a bubble floating up on the surface of the water and they look at you and they blink and you can hear just barely over the audible sound of the Delirium this low gurgling noise we have company where the lake can you not hear it thank you here's the Delirium the eyes their eyes in the delirium well in the lake well in the lake Sebastian forget the delirium why what is it something's coming there is a rushing of waves in the water and this is bad the water the surface of the water breaks with a loud splash and a thrashing noise as these this trio of eyeballs in the shape of a carbuncle rise up out of the water on the back of a titanic mound of flesh as it rises up these long spindly green tentacles rise up out of the river with it around this creature that is just this mat of this mound of mottled green flesh with spines of delirium growing up out of its back and these long lashing tentacles and this these three little eyes on the top of its head and then you see it this massive toothless ma from which a long pink tongue extends this creature is the size of an elephant roar initiative it's just a big frog at the little area it's a delivery guy nine nine four vo 1915 okay do you do [Music] and [Applause] all right as it rises up out of the water vales quick warning means that Sebastian you are the first to act [Music] all right Sebastian sees the giant monster appear in front of them and he is going to oh boy I'm gonna pull out yeah all right Sebastian grabs his wand in his hand and runs forward a few feet and okay um kind of lines the wand across where the monster is and I'm going to so you see like kind of winds start blowing through my cape and my hair as I kind of lift a few inches in the ground and swing my wand across and a line casting wall of fire fire wha does the Delirium do anything from podcasting indeed in this case it does Sebastian roll to d6 fire know that I was actually gonna say that shoot the Delirium crystal just to see what happens [Music] Academy wants to keep it 3 what did you get out what were the numbers on the dice two and one okay roll it D 100 please I don't like where this is going I really like where this is going 69 okay as the magic of the spell Kol Esther's around you there is a surge of wild magic that resonates out from all the Delirium around you and what did you get for the 69 okay and all of a sudden as you look around you Sebastian and veil and Pluto have disappeared and veo and Pluto Sebastian has disappeared too you're still standing there because everybody is now invisible look like they've gone yeah it just looks like everyone vanishes but everyone's just become invisible I'm right here where are you guys everybody reach out your hands oh I don't I can hear you I can smell you so it's all good all right okay anything else Sebastian I'm gonna after that I move behind just back towards that wall okay there yeah okay so here's what happens you see this massive smooth run through the wall of fire so something has charged directly through the wall of fire and come out and so I need you to roll damage for the water fire Oh cuz it's invisible - yes I'm oh it's the Delirium lake yep [Music] I'm gonna use my meta magic get your reroll two of those there we go so that is [Music] 29 nice yeah as it rushes through the fire there's there's these licking flames that outline the shape of it as it rushes through the fire and you can see it goes like this massive frog like creature going and it's clearly enraged and hungry and so these instead of front limbs it just has these four tentacles and this massive tongue and very confusedly it sweeps the tentacles out in a wide arc around it because it doesn't really know where any of you are so it's gonna make attacks with disadvantage against veo and pollute oh because they're still within its reach as it jumps out because it's going towards the last thing and it's still invisible right it's still invisible and so you can't see it doing this either so technically the disadvantage negates itself at least on its first attack okay so I'm gonna see whether Pluto or veo is hit first 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 so veil gets hit first so it has no disadvantage on this one it's just Eve even so so it goes to hit veil with the tentacle and it gets a 27 oh my gosh they oh they'll you take 24 points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled the other tentacle sweeps towards polute Oh with disadvantage now because you can see it and it gets a 15 to hit miss cool it sweeps around and then the the tentacle that's grasping the invisible veil it like starts to grasp and grab like it's trying to figure out what it's got in front of it and so it doesn't really seem like it's grabbing you and it looks it looks towards you very puzzled like it wants to bite down on something but it can't quite see what's there mm-hmm all righty so it is now visible we now go to pollute oh it hears from the darkness the nothing Bergner yes and there's a feeling of more fire in front of it but it can't see it as I slice down on this tentacle that's reaching out towards an invisible creature and I'm a mama i'ma do my thing yeah I get a 19-2 hit that is a hit looks like hitting the broadside of a barn it's got thick flesh but it's not hard ahead and I'm going to how big is it such a huge creature yep gosh fire fire fire doing four fire damage and thirteen regular damage nice as the flames of ignatius rip into it you can see that the water or that it's covered in and the hydration and skin it seems to make it resistant to the fire damage darn it oh well keep hitting it um I've committed and I'm gonna swing again for 23 to hit that is a hit for better oh my god to fire damage thankfully okay and 14 regular damage nice so you cleave into this massive hulking creature renting out pieces of flesh and sending flecks of delirium flying off of it but it continues unrelentingly and i want to try using maneuvering attack and i want to see if i can allow veo to be able to escape its grass feed is zero so she needs to spend an action to break out of its ground oh then I will use distracting string okay so take another 8 damage nice and the next attack against it is with advantage all right veo all right I'm gonna stay in its grasp and I take my hand crossbow okay and is just Evangel mana TAC one TAC okay okay I'm gonna take it 1111 yeah the bolt collides with it and does not penetrate its skin mmm that's one of the four keep shooting uh 21 that the second shot goes through did you do okay one two actually certain one it's different different now 22 damaged nice gross no Kansai third and 13 does not penetrate so with the flurry of shots that you fractured you try it as you become visible it lashes lashes you around and you're not able to make a shot in on it and I'm trying to cleave like the tentacle arm and you're just shooting it with the tentacle arm is as thick as a tree trunk yeah we go to the top of the round with Sebastian Croley go curly flies is curly invisible - yeah so is my invisible bird flies into the invisible frog the frog is no longer invisible once you attack you become visible okay so are we all visible now you are the only one that remains invisible could you have intact you yeah cool yeah when you attack or cast a spell you become visible so invisible curly flies into the beasts eyes and starts plucking at them and then I I'm just going to cast a scorching ray upon it okay roll to d6 with super @o to d6 because magic wrap a 6 & a 4 okay because you roll the six you can tap into the magic here and if you want to you can roll twice on the wild magic surge shape table and choose yep all right first oh no it's gonna be 49 49 okay well you can't speak for the next minute and when you try pink bubbles float out of your mouth easy choice 67 67 you are frightened of the nearest creature - until the end of your next turn I'll take four bubbles so because you can't speak this means you can't cast spells with verbal components oh so the the scorching ray goes off but now you can't cast spells with verbal but I still get the scorching ray oh yeah so as I'm screaming out the verbal components of scorching ray my voice just disappears and and the the frog a moth has a moment of recognition it's like oh you speak bubbles we understand it's a thread and now I blossom in the face I'm gonna roll my yeah elven accuracy Oh 26 to hit that is a hit so the first one oh sure eight damage becomes four damage [Music] eighteen that hits but you don't have advantage anymore remember oh right that was only right it's only on the one okay in the last shot sixteen all of them hit all right five more okay eight more okay BAM I need something other than fire sports alrighty anything else Sebastian cruelly flies back to me okay and I duck behind the wall okay yeah I'm Pluto push them into the fire it does nothing okay the froggy moth lumbers forward and it extends two tentacles one towards pollute oh and one towards Sebastian no it's gonna capture all of us Sebastian I get a 25 and Pluto I get a 29 it's not to hit yeah yeah I mean you got me so you are both grappled by the frog amah and Pluto you take 26 damage cool and Sebastian you take 21 damage as the tentacles lash around my wrists a oh you held in its hand it's tight and it's tentacle its tongue reaches out towards OH begins to wrap around you as it relaxes it's gripped on the other tentacle make his strength saving throw 20 you miss - the tongue wraps around you and starts pulling at you and you grab onto its own tentacle and hold on so it can't pull you close to the - to it so it's like it's trying to use its tongue to pull you close to its mouth so it can chomp down on you but you're grabbing on to its other tentacle and so you're being held between its two tentacle tongue and its arm tentacle that's trying to eat you and you can just see as you narrowly like pull yourself back it goes chop can I take a swing at it for Sentinel because it's attacking my my right beside me and I take a swing and I crit do I get two reroll the fire damage - yeah the fire damage is doubled oh my gosh it's only the base damage that doesn't get added again so 11 regular damage 8 fire damage and another six regular damage and 11 fire damage so what's the total oh my god that was 11 fire damage twice wasn't it 11 regular at the 11 17 regular damage and when I say what I say fire I think was 11 fire total yeah I rolled 11 on the second one Oh what was the first one was it was like low it was like it was seven so it was 18 fire and 17 nice regular damage that leaves the frogmouth bloodied owls out and so lumbering backward from the crickets actually still its turn it used its uh it hole tightens its grip around you pollute oh so you're grabbed by it Vail's grab by it Sebastian's grabbed by it you're all grabbed it's got you it's got you got you oh no Pluto and it is your turn I seeing the weakness in its tentacle arm I keep swinging and I bring I yell out ignatius will reveal the truth of what's inside you I get like a 24 to hit Wow for 12 regular damage and seven fire damage and I just keep on and I'm just hacking at like now that the tentacle that's holding me as it's swinging me okay and I get a 22 to hit I think we're 15 regular damage and five fire damage so you've dealt 30 damage in total do you want to cut off the tentacle that's holding me yeah yes okay you do so and then I run at it and I do this the shield slam into it to try to push it back into can I shove a huge you can't because you're too small it's so big I just run into it yeah at full speed and my my shields to side a little bit and then I bounce oh yeah you're up alright I'm still in this part um coming at me and yeah it's like you you look like a tasty tasty snack to it yeah with some bite I get a 20 to hit that hits 20 damage 14 hit that hits just gets it in oh and do I get this think you saw you guys think it's that cuz I'm standing right there and I cuz I pushed it with my shield so I give it a Boop twenty-eight damaged okay so here's what happened it's pulling you into its mouth and chomps down and you lower your crossbow and you shoot directly into its mouth and at one point it's just it just yawns openly enough that the crossbow bolt goes right down its throat and inside its stomach and clearly something Rufford ruptures inside it and it starts to like shake and it just wretches forth this pile of gore as it flips back over onto its back and dies in the fire in the fire in the fire so my wall of fire did one more shot just for good measure and I go man you're yeah the load I did I end up stopped putting in bolts and I'm just like and it wretches up what looks like to be the remains of about three or four zombified humans oh that were slightly aesthetically dissolved so it's hard to tell whether they were actually zombies but it looks like they were they were dead before they were eaten they were dead then Undead and then eaten and then digest oh no just keep kicking its corpse back into the water don't throw up we still need the expert geo in our system good good guys I'm not gonna lie I thought that fire wall would hold it back it didn't it didn't mind it it didn't mind it at all hind ignatius either it just kept taking the swings I killed it turns out the best method was to just shoot at a bunch yeah I mean I mean I chopped off an arm I you helped I helped you turned everyone invisible that was kind of interesting yeah yeah I can still talk telepathically guys you want to see my new magic trick I'm popping bubbles as they come out oh you don't know where those have been no exactly they're from me they're from inside him a bit sore that hurt a little bit was it getting grabbed by a tentacle um yeah checks checks HP oh yeah it squeezed me a bit hey do you want to take just a quick health potion do we have a regular health potion not the greater weight how much is a greater again twenty you know what I will take that greater I will yeah we can use one yeah pink bubbles float out of your mouth yeah it's cool it's neat I'm just glad you're not so caught up in the Delirium anymore one of them bursts in your I feel an invisible poke in your eye my guy spoke of me we should go in go inside we should stop scurrying around yes alright let's go ahead I think my firewall goes away okay maybe the steps of the amethyst Academy room before you the door is marked with the sigil of the Academy the all-seeing eye the over an inverted pyramid as you head up the steps it's the sloping ramp that leads up to that doorway but Sebastian as you approach the ring that you wear from your mother resonates and the ramp just goes in two steps Wow I was gonna say that's really interesting but I keep forgetting well Guys looks like somebody already has claim to this tower and it's me well let's go let's count the steps I start carefully steps and head up the steps alpha to the golden cross the door of the Academy a set of double doors what do you do it's been about a minute right I think so if we have to wait we wait the 30 seconds or so it's this kind of a like knock and like hey we just go in that's okay i from my memories I know I didn't come to this tower I went to a different tower for school now the towers generally like magically locked yes and usually they open to those who bear the Rings don't worry guys I've got this should wipe your feet on the mat first we're not animals yeah are we just gonna we're just gonna walk in right or just yeah yeah it's gonna be fine all right Thomas push on the doors place your hand a ring of runes appear where you where your hands go and you can feel them shift and there's like this little clicking sound of like cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat and you can see the ring on your finger is actually rotating with runes as well and there is a flash of light and that's kind of this keening wail of a sound and the doors slide open all right no I want to do a quick check behind us as we open the doors is there anything else in the in the water by the crystals and in the courtyard make a perception check we probably should have put the Frog back in the pond is burning in the remnants of the wall of fire I have a passive perception of 20 but I only rolled a okay five-six looking out the areas quiet behind you I should close the door behind us yeah cuz I just figure like if if this requires this to get in maybe Oscar couldn't get in and he might be waiting for us in the shadows waiting for us to give him his like key but does it look like the crystal has been dragged up into the tower mmm he's probably already in here yeah you mean used to have a ring to probably like lock the door from the inside yes see what you can do if again I have one thought of how we could rod We Trust oh wow well leave a here not to burst your bubbles the door slid no well then you're off the hook this time put it down like really low so that if he comes through any trips and he's not watching it's just like it's like mmm then you'll have the rod I mean and he'll trip inside your head in there is a grand hallway with that is lit by spectral candles floating in the air the inside the Academy is a marble stone floor that glistens even through the ages shining the spectral lights floating above some of them are orbs some of them are the shape of candles some are in the shape of lanterns and they all hang in the air and gently Bob upwards and downwards the thing that strikes you immediately as you enter into the room is that the walls are glass and you can see out through them inside the tower like a one-way mirror yeah so when you step into this large Lobby like room and look out it's like the external walls are not even there there's the ceiling there and there's internal walls as well but the external walls just disappear entirely so somebody could there's a structure you can see that there are pillars on the corners that hold the whole tower together but whatever is and there are internal walls as well before there are four great chimneys that reach up on the opposite end of this room each of which which is Oh has a door before it and two of the doors are smashed open and blown off their hinges and you can see this column of rubble spills out from the doors that we're there the third door is closed completely it's another set of these metallic double doors the fourth one the sliding doors are slowly sliding open and then one slides back into place and then the other like slaps and then slam slam slam into the other so it keeps opening and closing and opening and closing and you can see as it opens up that once in a while you can hear this crackling energy coming from the column that resonates a puppet the rest of this large room you can see that there is a final chimney on the corner that has a spiral staircase going up and down as well it's a large spiral staircase and in one of the corners it goes down one level and back up it appears that those four chimneys might go along the higher length of the tower itself and the rest of the room has in the center there is a large circular fountain and garden with this dead tree in the center of it that is floating on a pedestal of floating rock it looks like it was once like the rock and the roots were floating in the air but the tree is dead now and it's fallen down and collapsed and the water has mostly evaporated and then all surrounding the rest of this room are well upholstered couches and a few tables and desks and what looked like to be several side areas where one could fix a drink or something like that and then in front of the four chimneys with the doors in front of them there's what looks like to be a very large Bureau style desk that's in a semicircle with a chair at it as well and there are papers strewn all about and you can see in many of the walls and here and there are robes and dust about three pairs of robes of them at this Academy rows and then they're just dust surrounding them welcome to the amethyst Academy this is where we're going to infer tonight we made it we made it in no problems zero issues other than a giant rock Arthur can I ask about the the walls the walls in the outside like it's glass but what about the internal walls are they also like see-through there they're made of marble oak on the inside yep so the the internal walls that are around kind of and it's very tastefully constructed like that where the four chimneys are there is this internal wall that picks up and then on the corners of the building itself there is internal walls and then you'll see that there are very thin columns along the outside but they wouldn't be supportive there's the main pillars on the corners that support it and that and the ceiling itself is vaulted up to a height of 40 feet okay new new house it's it's a fixer-upper you got a full of delirium right now so we'll see we'll see cool well a big thank you as always to our
