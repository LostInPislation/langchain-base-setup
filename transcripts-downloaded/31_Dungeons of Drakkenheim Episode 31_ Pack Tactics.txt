new stuff out there in the future we've already got a few ideas there so keep an eye out pretty nice up in the future with that now finally we can return to the ruins of dragon hein some time has passed since the Battle of temple gate the embers and the wild chaos of battles between the hooded lanterns the Noles and the silver order still scream out across the streets of Dragon I'm both in the sprawl outside the city walls and throughout the temple district of the inner city of Dragon high me in the midst of this chaos our heroes have most recently ventured to a alchemists shop to recover ingredients that they will use to co-opt the research of Oscar urine in the hopes of sustaining Queen Lenore's condition we go now to the barracks where Sebastian Crowe is working away with these all chemical ingredients on this concoction as the three of you continue to train veo practicing your magic and pollute opor ACTA saying how to kill people that use magic in the wake of that of those ingredients recovered every time you think I you've gotten close to it I just like sparks fine we'll try again in a couple of minutes I have lost my eyebrows three times so far I just draw them on they're not like orange completing mm-hmm they working all right man following my own instructions I should have taken better notes Green hey what do you agree try it you try you try it I lose my eyebrows okay I draw them back after a few days of laborious work you think you might have something that's usable guys I think I might have something that's usable that's the most confident you've been in the last three days yeah I just for me mm-hmm I don't know how to test this though how much we just had I have made one vial which sustains the Queen for how long that's a great question if you like this is a negative like if it takes you three days to make one vial now that I got it I can make them faster because I wrote down mixed green and blue the Queen under ideal circumstances through Oscar yarns notes she needs to be administered this daily so there's like this one vial gets Thursday so how is she doing since it's been like a few days of me trying to figure this out well over the days of you working on this you haven't been in too much contact with her although veil you probably have been visiting her every day yeah she has become extremely irritable at times throwing out the food that has been brought to her screaming and rage almost out of nowhere and many people have been afraid to approach her in her room so they over the past couple days it has just been pretty much just you that has been able to approach her with how angry she is and it really feels like probably it's gonna have to be you that administers it to her yeah I want to try it we haven't done human testing yet so I mean worst case she dies I mean she's gonna die anyways without it right that's kind of what I'm figuring this is the closest I've come to being the same as the Oscar your notes that I have here so okay I think I've got it I'm like 98% sure mmm whatever get like invisible major because I don't want her throwing things in my head again luckily I'm fast enough or I can dodge them but just animal make her better than the shoe she might be into that area I'll wait here all right Pluto what do you think I can come with you I can use my shield as some sort of shield against weaponized objects in her room okay maybe maybe you can convince her to eat and we can like sneak it into her food or something I think she can know about it she wants it it's an injection it has to be delivered to her heart yeah oh yeah then there yeah I'll just been having some times there so I'll give her the old razzle that distract her with with my jingling keys not a baby Sebastian okay with a couple days of work you'll be if this works you'll be able to synthesize enough off of this concoction that with about three days of work you'll probably be able to make about 2d6 days worth of doses for this so it is sustainable especially if you skip her on every other day because it takes her about a week to degenerate to this state but from what Oscar yarn has said the way that he designed this was that she would be given it daily every three days she can get will spread them out a veritable one try to wean her off you know yeah it's not clear what might happen by skipping days if that will cause any sort of condition to advance or not hmm anything in the notes here do not skip days don't skip leg day every day so it's all good I mean good jump around the city a lot I don't think you're skipping in two days all right well me and micro are gonna stay down here and make more of these you go tell me how this works out okay Bluto you comin yeah I'll come all right I go up to the Queen's chambers you head up through the the barracks where the Queen's chambers are passing the law Elena Krueger who winks you a knowing nod from the queen of Thieves to the chamber before the Queen's private apartment where the Lord Commander is pacing back and forth impatiently and he turns to you and he says is it ready got it it's here I mean we haven't tested it so we don't know what's gonna happen but this is the best that we can do do we have any other choice I don't think so let her die but that's not really a choice exactly all right I can do it go ahead it's not gonna be pretty we're gonna go in okay and I knock on the door there's a voice within it says what is it it's today oh my Your Majesty I've come with good tidings for your health come in i tiptoe in what's what's the room look like is it light is dark there is still some broken glass in the room from the last bit of Rage that the Queen suffered and she has turned most of the lights down in in here keeping only a few candles lit and as you come in you can see that the candle light shows that that just glints off the hint of the Queen's mask on the ground oh and you see her hand reach out and she turns from you because you can see through with your dark vision that she grabs it and hastily pulls it towards her face as you come into the room yeah thank you for putting that on because I don't personally feel like getting my fur singed today your majesty um so we've done some work we got some of the goods that are gonna sustain you for now each ad grump that you're in she breathes a heavy sigh of either relief or regret perhaps oh and she says finally let's get it over with so from what I've been told this has to go directly into your heart it's not gonna be comfortable but it's gonna keep you alive she the mask gaze turns towards Pluto Lord Jackson please a lady must have her honesty or modesty and I am going to close the door as I leave but I'm gonna stay right at the door and listen yeah there's a gasp of pain that you can hear on the other side Pluto as Vayu administers the solution and a few moments later they'll you come out sorry that was a little bit hard next time I'll try to be more gentle oh she seems woozy and confused in the moment as you injected it into her heart you saw the surge of almost power come out of it as it poured through her veins washed over her and she is immediately filled with a fatigue should take some time to rest and know that there is more on the way to keep you sustained for as long as we can have the ingredients she says thank you give my respects to the two is it crow yeah Sebastian he might make a good doctor pass it on he's been working very hard and singed a bit of his eyebrows off for you but he would do anything to keep tracking hi it was much gentler than what Oscar yarn had made I hope it works as well I hope so too if there's anything that comes up we would like to know because really this is all chance and circumstance of what we're doing we're trying to go based on what Oscar says but if you notice anything that is different please let us know so that way we can adjust the formula she knots and with that she takes to her bed it sneak quietly out of the room a few moments later Sebastian you come up as well to the chamber outside with the Lord Commander you've done an excellent job you three thank you try you're welcome I watch I'm gonna need detailed notes on any sort of strange behaviors it might seem like it's working but we don't know for sure we're gonna have to watch her the next few days you bet if everything goes according to plan I'll make more can you show Elena and Petra how to use the solution I think so Petra yes I think this is something that should be kept maybe to one person I wish I could spare them I trust Elena and Etra more than anyone else that they're the best women on my force there's a few other the other men that I would give that offering that I would certainly trust to do it but there's not enough women and if we need to respect our queen can you show them both and I make it like I yond at the same time but there's a clearly a discomfort in my oh man yeah hey yeah yeah we'll well teacher had a stab at thing into the Queen's heart that's totally cool well what's the worst that could happen it's it's enough it's bad enough that I have to keep them from the front lines mm-hmm but you've had a bit of a rest now I trust even though even working hard but it's time to move on the Cathedral or hardly working you know bad joke okay people are dying Sebastian yeah I'm trying to lighten the mood it's very stuffy in here you've been inhaling a lot of potions yeah not well-ventilated I didn't see you once wear your goggles your eyes are probably yeah that would have stopped the high stinging thing like days ago they really pointed at it twice and I just let it happen I was wearing his goggles I was like good good buddy smart you protest 81st your shadowy form that doesn't get affected anyway yeah we'll sounds yeah I'm well rested thank you thanks for a solution or a little but I think there's so much to be done right boys it yeah we've housed temple gate does it hold it does it's a slaughterhouse out there not we have to keep rotating our soldiers and we're running out of ammunition I mean we've got to be whittling down the Noles by this point we are there's bodies of them piled high it's time to break them we've had a couple attacks led by the Lord of the feast when they whenever that's happened we've retreated back to temple gate and the Beast does as well we have to decide now how we're going to handle this situation if we want to draw him out and slay him or seek him out in his lair and take him there oh I think I mean he's at more of an advantage if we're gonna go Adam that's true he is at an advantage in the Cathedral but there he has nowhere to run yeah but also the damage that could be done to the Cathedral are we not trying to preserve as much as possible indeed yeah I'm gonna probably be blowing some things up so I don't know if I want to set off too much fire inside the Cathedral yeah if that's if that's what our next goal is to take out the Lord of the feast destroy the Noles once as long as the Lord of the feast still draws breath the Noles will continue to be relentless in their attacks if we break him destroy him their power in this part of the city will be broken there will still be many of them but they won't be able to put up the or the resistance in the numbers or with the theory that they have so far we'll actually be able to secure a part of the city the inner city in a way that we've never been able to do before there will still be monsters there will still be beasts it will still be dangerous in the city but far less so we'll actually be able to mount more expeditions as someone who plans to add killing the Lord of the feast to his yeah resume tally what have you my suggestion is we set up a trap give them that lure them out with some sort of like really appetizing sort of situation why are you pointing at me why are you smiling why is everyone smiling pointing at me such a good distraction I am loud fun user strengths and you got taken him head-on and then when he comes out we we we am with everything that we need to take him down for example you guys and this and maybe some fire and my sort so you're proposing drawing him into a trap yes give him if the nulls are attacking the gate to try to take it back give them give them something so juicy give them that that that free kill that that little in a group of antelope that one with the little weird leg that can't run as fast but then when he gets close Papa's here is that a good analogy yes it's but there is one bait that draws the lord of the feast more than any other carnage battle no he's driven by bloodlust and slaughter we're facing off against the greatest monster hunter from caspia I don't even think he understands what caspia is that's fair for us to present that we would need to strike into the city with force so far we haven't we've just had skirmishes but whenever we've assembled enough power in one area when it looks like we're starting to make a foothold somewhere that's when he attacks is there a nolle encampment or base that is not at the cathedral but is somewhere value there are dozens of camps but the Noles value nothing the only place that they seem to gather and congregate is at the cathedral itself there are many places where we can find bands of them to slaughter but they're nomadic they'll just as soon as live as in a hovel as they will in a temple but they've made that their nest they have maybe that's or why I don't understand maybe we go around just keep killing the bands of nulls until he comes and finds us hmm I think bringing him in for a big big show the best way to what where is the Cathedral yeah if we pull up our map of Drakon Haim so you can see that on the map we have the middle word and the temple ward and on your map at the spot marked 11 is the Cathedral of Saint the Truvia it is a massive structure it is one of the buildings that you can see like the mage tower the clock tower the cat and the castle you can see the dome of the cathedral of st. Matt review from almost anywhere in the city in the cathedrals spires itself rise up hundreds of feet and it has two very prominent landmarks that you can see throughout the city which is both its massive dome top the top to the cathedral itself and then also the massive bell tower that is beside it that is a bell tower that was active so it's not quite as tall as the clock tower itself but it's almost is as and it was the active clock tower through the time that you lived in the city you would have remembered the seven bells of Saint retrieve you ringing basically every day is it above the haze the the bell tower itself is not quite as tall as the clock tower the clock tower itself is over 300 feet tall whereas the bell tower itself is not quite as high as that in fact the bell tower is not as tall as the top of the dome of the cathedral okay so the very top of the dome of the cathedral rises up to this little small spire that that part the topmost chimney of that is almost as tall as the clock tower that's yep so it's about 275 feet or so on and that's about the height of the bell tower as well so it is a tall structure the bell tower itself is not quite built into the structure of the Cathedral it is just slightly off the cathedrals main structure and then it rises up on its own again it's not as large as building as the the old clock tower but it is still a significant one okay yeah and then the only other building that is in that plaza there's a there's a huge plaza surrounding the the Cathedral that is filled with public fountains and then there was one other building that was the the basically the worshipers of the sacred fire often have a sacred building that the water that they used to anoint themselves sometimes this is built into the churches as like the first building that you walk through but in the case of the Cathedral st. attribute it's actually an outbuilding that is an opposite on the other side of the street and it's this massive beautiful building opposite but from what you seem to recall of the times that you've pastored this area people that have come through it so that it actually might be totally destroyed which would be tragic because it was one of the oldest buildings in Drakon huh okay a little bit of ruin there might be a plan it's half of a plan but it's a plan what if we march on the cathedral draw the lord of the feast out and then fall back to Market Square and try to lure the Lord of the feast towards slaughter corpse cut it up square try to get them to follow us leading the pack of nulls do you think they know about it though hey if we can we know where to avoid if they also avoid it then we fight them in the open at Market Square we could also potentially call upon the aid of the fish people yeah you think though the Lord Commander nods at the the notion of chain of luring Lord of the feast out in this way he's a hunter he loves a chase we still put up a fight outside the cathedral we start the fight there we march on it we attack outside the gates until he comes out then we start backing on we set up most of our forces in Market Square watching and waiting and then when we draw him in and then we have the corpse collector it's going to be difficult to move a large number of people towards a Market Square or towards slaughter stone Square without causing the without inciting the Noles anyways will be difficult we'll have to move them in position and use an attack on the Cathedral to give ourselves the time to move into position so the distraction and then bring them towards Market Square we can set up some forces at the clock tower and move them across as well the clock towers right out so the silver order still has horses we could go to the night commander and propose a cavalry charge through the streets to attack the cathedral directly draw the lord of the feast out into battle and then you with the night captain lure the lord of the feast towards slaughter stone square we will bring nets and explosives and we will bomb off the entry with the exit ways to slaughter stone square so I'm in the access to the square things up to what are they called like the death trap like the kill zone we create like a kill zone where he can't escape and the executioner will do half of the work for us and then you us three teleport onto one of the buildings so we want to make sure we just didn't get caught up in that I can ride a car selector you could ride a horse ride a horse I lost my horse when I got here the dead subtract no that was your I would have known that horse that was a different horse um I can run this fast you're going to have to make the lord of the feast feel like he's on a hunt give him that primal chase if you get too far ahead of him he might give up but if he feels like he's chasing you if he feels like you're worthy enough prize it just might work that's fast now we can we can we can make him feel like he wants to battle uh oh I'll tie a bunch of pots and pans to pray me with like Noll pheromones Thank You NOLs what have we coded me with like like a scent we can't even make it to the cathedral if you're smelling like no that's it's Oh buddy we're bringing if you show your strength to Pluto as a worthy prize for the knoll to take he'll come after you I'll kill a bunch of noise right in front of them I think together if we show we're a band that's worth killing he'll go after us we start telling him well give him one defeat us a prize that he can't refuse just start talking about all the prizes you've killed trolls I've killed one bridge of minotaurs you know one of them got away yeah only one with my biggest regret I've killed one less than a full so once we draw him out you will then we're going to talk to the night captain you will go forth from temple gate with the silver order assault the Cathedral directly once the Lord of the feast joins The Fray lead him through the streets of Dragon haim through Market Square to slaughter stone square there we will trap him and the execution will serve his sentence it was all me came up with that all by myself thank you I will be sneaking in the shadows and I get to be allowed I don't finally I get to be loud I get to blow things up I think this benefits all of us I mean you did come I just pointed at it but I'm glad you put it together you're pointed at Market Square and the rest of it fell into place it like I think this is too funny when are we doing this when the clock tower reaches I'm wondering do we how far away is amberwood Village only a few miles you could travel back think we need to maybe do some shopping what kind of supplies do you need Deb potions we have a few Sebastian's probably they able to make a couple as well I can make us a few minor aldor has anything that's worth checking yeah we haven't spoken to old or in a while I got I have a lot of gold hey guys I'm like what can we buy two plus we have a bunch of stuff that we need to pawn off like we could it wouldn't hurt I'm I'm I'm feeling those vibes we could use especially fighting what I assume is a very dangerous opponent with another very dangerous opponent like there's a couple of wild cards that work yeah we're words leading a wild card into another wild card and hoping that they destroy each other like they could team up and just fight us we don't know that that would be bad so that's why we read worse no please guys I was also I was flipping through my mother's spell book you know when you'd like tuck things somewhere and then like years later you find them yes it turns out I have three Scrolls tucked in the back of this book but I forgot about now so if we need a lightning bolt greater invisibility or gaseous form I have a potion of invisibility well I do those snacks a lot actually I took them away years later sometimes I eat them I feel like yeah I was about to say like I think you have the best I'm like the handle those snacks you find several days later what if we lead him into slaughter stone square and then I'll turn invisible and disappear it's hilarious that is hilarious I mean I can turn invisible because I have a potion you can turn invisible I have greater invisibility potion or scroll what does that do multiple no greater invisibility doesn't break when you attack or cast a spell right but is still just on me I you can use the scrolls magic on anybody any one person I think it would go really well with our video well I already have one of them visibility we're not greater but not great and then you could just keep shooting people for tons of damage and all the advantage and they don't know where the ants are coming from scary for them so I could be invisible in in shadows and light yes oh my god so we might be able to turn you into an invisible killing machine just for backup to the executioner and then I will teleport with you can you can climb really well yes so I can or you can use your teleportation to get us somewhere safe I can climb it but I kind of want to murder him with my hands then do it well why are we bringing him in to slaughter some square if you want to murder him with your hands I feel like we can kill both of them I'm kind of getting greedy right now I want to kill both of them we you never know where we need the executioner if I didn't if I like times like these you know what's going on Jax I want to kill a whole slaughter stone full of monsters that's my new goal Pluto hey my I think you go for it thank you I have a potion of heroism that's all I need oh so you'll feel heroic you know I can get you out I can get you out yeah I will be fine yeah what's what what's the worst thing about that's nothing bad will come of you fighting both of them in slaughter stone square will me and Vale hide yeah we ever all cast me insane chaos comes in threes that why it's always and then when it's me and them like if it was just me and him it would be bad but if there's three of us it's a good lay shall I call for the night captain I think so yes yeah we've got like 48 percent of a plan now yeah very well well we can probably have him here for the afternoon is there anything that you three would like to do in the meantime time's it no still early in the day how many potions can I brew one he worked on one for the rest of the day could we do could we call all door can we do not to you say there's a couple miles right yeah if you would like to arrange a meeting with if you'd like to get this in order later you could ask the Lord Commander to delay the meeting so that you can go back to ember wood village and and do any shopping or if there's any other supplies or things that you think you might want could be good to see what magic items he might still have potentially your body's took something that you wanted Sebastian correct I don't even remember about my bracers from him I mean I recently got a pearl of power which is pretty cool this delirium or makes me more magical so mating so I don't know what else I could buy from him or the trip do you want to make the potion while we take a trip no I want to come along that's where I live I want your dad I'm gonna see my paw all right well we can say have your dad just in case we die in this whole endeavor the logic it makes sense but it's like I need you okay in case we die I should say bye to my dad and see how does that make you feel I mean this this will be like what the third or fourth time I say bye to my dad and I'm like dad I'm going back into the city you might not see me again I feel like I've said he's got a bored of it now he's like come on you just be dramatic okay so you would like to arrange at least a day for you to go back to amberwood village before the plan the plan before you set a meeting with the night captain and put the plan in action yeah okay so with that you are able to set out for pack up your things and set out for amberwood village again with the routes clear through the outskirts of the city to get to the outskirts of the city but with the chaos around the spokes it's a bit of a longer journey than normal to get to Everwood village because it's just it's there's too much fighting that's occurring in the sprawl to make it to Styx's Ferry if you do want to risk that journey you certainly can but there's a lot more danger in that area right now okay the the silver order has set up another ferry of their own across the river further down so it's outside the city putting him out of business for sticks these are inner city but the reason being is that the the silver order has taken up has contacts with the clergy in the chapel in Emerald village and they've also been using that as a staging point as well so they've been traveling back and forth to there and instead of going through the city they use that route instead as you come into amber wood village after you it takes the bulk of the day so you arrive in amber wood village later in the evening and as the Sun is going down you can see that there is another group of pilgrims of the falling fire that are making their way in towards the city and as you look over the group of people there's a larger number of locals in the group and you can see that the folks from the bark and Buzzard tavern have closed the tavern and they are going with the people of the following fire into the city I'm just gonna serve me beer are you guys sure your heart is in the right place you guys closing down the shop they they turn to you and they say times are changing friendly and the word of Lucretia Mathias she speaks the truth of the flame it's our purpose to go and help her you had a pretty good purpose before then okay they kept me fed yeah maybe we can show you a different light you sure you're okay jamming rocks on your chest like literally into your heart they look at you very confused and the preacher that is leading them says you know nothing of their destiny ahead of them don't cloud their thoughts with your deceptions do you have much gem in your heart the falling fire burns within my heart indeed can you show them that your heart is burning he says is not yet for them to know what comes beyond silence get away from my flock who has the book do you have the book I have the book we've read the book yeah read it we're like we're pretty up to date on the current customs and weirdly two owners have a buckin buzzer the family that runs the Barkin Buzzard and yeah I have Karen and Karen and I believe it's Karen and Holger Karen Holger just want to be fully transparent he's gonna eventually have you walk through a misty forest or misty like city noises like poison poison and danger and you had a jam a rock of delirium into your chest so full disclosure that's what's ahead of you or you can serve us drinks we made that journey it's make a persuasion check eat the the preacher responds there will be many trials ahead for you the road ahead is difficult but the flame will preserve you through faith well just know that if it seems too tough you can always come back here because we love you just the way you are before we loved you before you put rocks in your chest yeah we had faith in you this whole time here try it out now and I'm gonna pick up a rock and we like just try putting this in your chest just as like a trial thing don't do people then then we'll know what they're ready for it it's just the Delirium is a lot more volatile than a piece of stone the preacher slaps your hand and he says you make a mockery of our faith i you have done that yourself I I do good sir I do and back in caspia we we are informed when we make our decisions and the truth lets us sets us free you have not been truthful with your followers if they were true followers you would tell them what they're in store for so that they may prepare you are misleading your followers I've read your book I'm informed I've done the trial and sometimes you guys feel like charlatans the preacher turns from you and he says see how darkness corrupts even heroes see how lies and deceit and those that would turn you against your faith take even the guise of the valiant an Age of Heroes is coming but these are deceivers listen not to them and he opens up his his book and begins reading Psalms from it as loud as his voice can go and he cries out come those of you that have faith in destiny follow forward those of you that will be cowardly those of you that we will allow yourselves to be deceived you may stay here with this film and he begins walking forward and as he goes I tried to stealthily snap my fingers and torch his robe with prestidigitation okay what's your spell safety c11 uh he successfully saves the the brush of flame comes up the bit of his robes and he pushes it push it it pushes it away as it as it ignites and he says enough of your tricks let us pass in peace and do nothing for that we're in amberwood village if things get set on fire I get blamed Sebastian let's not light everything on fire oh my gosh that's right I was going to say God I'm Karen I am a hero I've done so many hero days I'm not a hero I'm mad about it so no I know it was everybody else at us a few people stop and look look back as they walk forward but the group moves on yeah you know we I I said my piece I did I got off what I wanted to I got it off my chest yeah and guys there's no point there is a point they've got there they're up to something yeah obviously what but what are we gonna do right now we're gonna I don't know we we're gonna be point of view maybe we want that delirium not in people's chests but in our pockets yeah those were those were our old friends though and they they would they didn't listen to us though I don't know if we were very convincing I bought alcohol from them for years they probably are just like and by years I mean actually not because I was too young but I went in there for food sometimes I just think we got it we may have to revisit the followers of the flame yeah they're gaining traction and it's freaking me out of it and like what if they're making glass people or something what they're doing I think that's what the stuff in the chest does hmm what if that's how they convert people and they want to destroy it all they want to keep it all it's scary man just just mark that down under problems added to the list Jesus right underneath like the clockwork people what to do with the rat brains we came here yeah we're here for shopping this is a fun day this is a treat yourself day yeah so let's stop worrying about the fact that several of our friends or acquaintances just wandered off yeah I need to talk to my fans any culture that they're not joining the cops where would you like to go first oh I need to make sure my family is okay oh good you want to go shopping and you know I'm going I'm going to my my new home breakfast first it's like nighttime is it it's the evening yeah breakfast for dinner breakfast lunch and dinner at your parents yeah because we missed a few meals well I had some rations I eat all the time the whole a meal would be nice and I can make it taste really good now I mean it would you're taking a whole half I could do magic now yeah you know I'd be more careful with that sorry so where are you guys gonna go let's go to and we'll find out where aisle door is and if he's in town we can visit them just blame it on it's new for me you arrive at the crow family's house and are welcomed warmly by Tobias Mora Peter Emma and civil we're very excited and relieved to see you all and Moyer is a little flustered because she wasn't expecting you but she manages to pull some more food out and put on and put on some extras as well she's bubbling a big pot of mutton stew so she throws in a few more potatoes and carrots and an extra hock of meat and sends Peter out to down the street and says go get it get an extra hock of lamb and bring it back and they make a lovely a lovely dinner for you all to enjoy and Tobias Crowe is very pleased to see that you're not dead hey I'm not dead yeah I also had a bash about a week ago look dad I'm not dead mm-hmm this food tastes very good how have you guys been you overcome you had any issues with the what do they called the followers of the falling fire yeah what's the word around town we've seen some businesses closing we've we saw it yes leaving well the the read of Everwood village Kosta Stavros he converted and at the chapel of st. our Dana there's been a row between two of the flame keepers because one of them is also converting as well they're all having arguments in the streets about it and everyone in the village is trying to say what's right and what's not I don't even even an argument there were two of the bills paladin's from the silver order earlier this week there are a few of them that were in the bark and Buzzard I was having a beer and two of them got into an argument with each other over the whole thing and one of them stormed off with a bunch of the followers of the falling fire saying that that the silver order that the hierarch didn't know what they were talking about anymore this is probably happening more and more than we're hearing yeah there's all sorts of word no vacuum in Illyria they're calling in all the flame keepers and they're going to have a diet to decide what to do about Lucretia Matthias whether she's already been excommunicated but everyone's all arguing about what's gonna be going on with this meeting that's gonna be happening there word is the silver order isn't here for what they say they are they're here to kill a croatian mathias i don't really see that as a huge negative just throwing that out there that takes care of some problems that actually would free up our big chunk of our list not really it would probably they're gonna ask us to help Mike or a murder about it right that's the problem is you don't want to talk very excited there's a lot of people all over are saying that this these followers of the falling fire there's a lot of them all across the the rest of the country and more it's not just the ones that are coming to Drakon Haim they're the ones that are the most faithful but everywhere else people like what they hear from her dad you got to keep our family safe i we made the trip to meet Lucretia and it got weirder than what you've heard like it's like it's weird it's weird like it's dangerous it's a problem and I need I need you to promise me that you're not going that way and that you're gonna make sure this family I've heard all sorts of things about those them saying that they're the Delirium is some sort of sacred coal that they breathe it in that they stab themselves with it that rumor it's all over people know about it the people that go up they know that that's what's coming they think it's gonna save them it's gonna poison them it's what its gonna do and we've seen what happens but that's what everyone else is saying back to them they're tired of being called crazy every time you call them crazy they think that they believe it even more we are they think the world is against them and for them it's just more proof that times are changing they are you're right we can't kill her no we have to pull the curtain back and show everyone who she really is because once they once we destroy her reputation and destroy everything that she stands for then she can disappear or die that doesn't show what Delirium really is right they think it's some healing stone it's not it's we've seen what it does to the Queen we've seen what it does to people yeah would we need to bring these people we need to show them or clean that could work because the Queen stands for everything that was dragging it could we show the people to clean and show them what actually happens when someone is exposed what's this about the Queen the Queen of Hearts nothing of a deck of cards we're just talking about a gambling we're like gambling your sons into gambling is a gambling problem gambling problem you've been going off in gambling and then those dens run by that queen of Thieves just terrible we met her but she's also kind of got very useful information maybe a spot of the old religion might do a bit of good boy oh I tried then they wanted me to Jamrock some a charity this close this close to jamming rocks in my chest this food is actually super delicious so good so good so good but you're going back into that city again aren't you have to yep listen you know those Noel's yep yeah we're gonna take care of them we're gonna fight the biggest one can't believe it you all are making the difference aren't you we try we're doing our best this armor really helps honestly thank you yeah not everybody sees it that way though unfortunately we're kind of fighting against the tides and hopefully eventually people will see all the great work that we're doing for the city I think they will the truth has a way of getting out oh god what happens it could be the villains if people want to see us that way but we'll do what we think is right with that the rest of the evening passes with good food some meat I may have more stories like fish flavor as I go but try to do it under the table hmm impressing the children with some magic sparks and in the morning you set off well we go to L door / outdoor I described with the children how you murder a mage they're very fascinated by it what's our coolest story to tell the kids they hang on to every word as you recall the battle oh yeah yes I think - a cat a group of hags grow becoming a giant ape yeah it was cool cool and as you tell the story I hope you don't tear that Lord of the feasts to pieces I hear his height as pure white would make a very nice cloak I would like to wear it ears perk up do you do leather work as well no but I got some friends I will bring you back the high of the Lord of the feast for you to make a cloak out of I don't know which one of us will wear the cloak I want to wear for my first it's like a hat on a hat they say a white cut they say fur is murder and this proves it I'm into it cool so in the morning you depart and say another good goodbye your father always gives you a little bit of a longer hug than is comfortable Sebastian and push you away it says come back alive I always do so far and that you had do all doors encampment which coming back this time you can see that he's got quite a lot more heavily armed guards this time and they've kind of put a little bit of a palisade around his campement but as you come into the camp you can see he is sitting in front of a big fire that they have knocking back a big meaty piece of ham still on the bone with there's a plate in front of him with like a pile of eggs and a mug that is overflowing with coffee and he swings it back takes a smoke of his cigar takes a bite of the ham and says ah business the only thing I like better than the smell of food really I thought food would have been top of a last outdoor business coin brings the next meal doesn't it so what can I do for you today you acquired any more interesting items yes well the mages guild has been in the area a bit more recently I've been able to make some nice purchases that I have been thinking I might be able to turn the savings around to you you always think of us yeah I hope you do always think of us are we your best customers we have to be your best customers we're still alive today gotta be like a huge thing well that Jupiter Jones has been through a few times where's Jupiter Jones when was the last time you saw him a few days ago he's been apparently exploring the north end of the city with all the chaos up in the south oh that's not good right well that's the North Castle where the castle is he we need to find him what if he has a badge we have no idea what Jupiter's even up to do we even if I know him [Laughter] Jupiter Jones where are you if I know him I hate him that is all we've saved each other's lives so we're like I think we have like I have a few things though that you might be interested in I have acquired a rather lovely piece several arrows imbued with magic to some weaponry potion hmm as well as some other trinkets what are you looking for I mean definitely magic arrows I'd be really interested in magic arrows cool he has the selection of magical arrows they're +1 arrows and he's selling them for 50 gold pieces of ease or just there are various designs but they all all amount to +1 arrows how many does he he has 20 he also says I've also acquired a bit of a restricted item it's a hot piece literally this was the wand of a mage known as it Ignatius and it contains the magic of the fireball spell I do but passing it from a wand means I don't use a spell slots how much 5,000 gold bases how much can we get for I have three turquoise animal figures I'll give you 250 gold pieces for them yeah just collect it all think you argue with Aldo I mean he's our best person to buy stuff we are also wired some very useful potions for the Explorer I have one of each available potions that will protect you from the fire poison frost and even electricity and the touch of the dead I have one of each available a 250 per piece the poison might actually come in handy because I don't know about the about about the lord of the feast but I would consider it if you're worried about death as well I hope this relic whole gestures to it it was a chain that was worn by a rather paranoid flame keeper is a parry opt of wound closure whoever wears it your you automatically succeed death saving froze the most and that is 750 gold pieces [Music] ludo you're about to go toe-to-toe with an executioner and I just throw that out there you mentioned weapons though as well indeed I have available a halberd that has been fashioned by the majors of the amethyst Academy as well as a longbow indeed what does it do there's been imbued with the magic of the Academy it is made of a wood known as sappy and pear wood very valuable indeed I can only part with it for two thousand gold pieces the halberd stock is made of the same material and shot through with mithril the price is the same there do you want to wicked longbow I'll chip in for your long but absolutely actually think I might have enough but I was hoping to get some magical arrows as well but I I have to say if there's one thing I've learned it's that I want you to do more damn it we also have five pearls with a turtle shell casing 100 gold pieces each my maths honestly spending all that money on arrows and the bow the halbridge doesn't really interest me I mean I'm not gonna use it I can't even lift the thing yeah how about soft drinks sodium's how many do you evidence they're delicious let me try one door here you go this one one free grape he drinks it this is incredible would you like to buy life stock of now where did you find this beverage I invented them you did sure and we're gonna make do you have a distributor now we're talking we have a me feat that me fit that can produces of them on the regular for from zero you'll just do it he's just down this may be more this is down there mate well the Balkan Buzzard has been closed I wonder if we could set up shop you move into the Barkin Buzzard those guys are gone like I mean gone they're not kind you have they have delirium already in their chest they're dead you open up the barking Buzzard call it the sodium shop and we start selling this stuff it's good for kids of all ages everybody well of course I'm not sure the Barkin Buzzard in this place is a very good venue for such a business anymore it seems that more and more people are packing things up and moving back into the city then maybe we'll just open the sodium shop when dragon hime is reclaimed I'm intrigued let's talk in the future okay I I would like to buy the bow well you must have some coin weighing you down darling I'd be happy to ease that burden for you are you good on cash flow if you sell the the pearls and the statues will that cover the bow in theirs will cover the bow and four arrows how many more arrows do you want let's just clean them out twenty let's clean them out I'm gonna be a thousand for all the arrows I'm gonna take the wound closing one because that seems important okay 750 and then veil I'm gonna just give you another for Honda which is enough to cover 20 years right no that's arrows another fifty each right yeah so I'll give you another four hundred for at least eight arrows yes you get eight more on top of the ones you got I'm gonna spend 250 on the potion of poison resistance okay and I will also give how much did how many arrows those potions of greater healing available for 100 gold pieces each I have nine gold yeah I'll buy two of those appointments so I should be fine there and you can at least use that for everyone especially if we get like what poison sorry cure any diseases and poison so I'm I don't need the poison potion what is the bow the bow he produces it out for you it is a beautiful beautifully engraved bow made of this gorgeous white wooden wrapped with a soft leather grip and the string is the silvery looking material and as you turn around though you can see that around the grip are several glass beads that have very small pieces of delirium in them what is it it is a it is a plus one Bo and he says I bought it from the Academy they didn't give it a name yet perhaps one day it will earn one from you cat scratch no that's not it Moonbeam no it'll come to I picture I was very impressed that the Halbert is the same they have taken these small pieces of delirium and infuse them into the weapon it secures the magical energies very fascinating damage other I do appreciate the halberd I just one-handed weapons are my specialty perhaps in time perhaps in time but I will take three greater healing potions certainly were they greater is superior greater their greater progress do you want any more arrows there's so money did we clean the matter with aerogel fourteen I think he is 26 left three hundred gold that's three hundred I had to and I fourteen so we took twelve so we he has eight left 400 gold yep I'll give you 400 gold so that you can buy them oh yeah and I give you four hundred so that was so much goodness you know we we're gonna you're you're doing something that doesn't they're gonna kill the Lord of the face when stuff as magic like when you're gonna tell me what I'm gonna so stab that thing I want to make a bet you know what you are the Slayer of the manticore technically that's true with your help I was like a team effort we should team at killing we're a team effort Pluto has learned that to kill a bridge of trolls or minotaurs sometimes you need your friends sometimes many hands make light work we're gonna kill a lot of things they're gonna die by all sorts of fire and sword and arrow I think I'm ready already yeah good luck I would hate to have to buy these back from someone who pawned them off your corpses yeah that that would be unfortunate but we will see you again and maybe you should think about a discount next time for your best friends and family I swear to you on my life that I would not give my own mother a better price you say that every time you have I've written down as I'm sure go to friends that your mantra is that you're a no you should you know what give them another sodium there's an orange one for the road thank you he's such a good guy I think that's where we're gonna take a break before we delve into the ruins again a big THANK YOU to accent shield for providing us with the awesome gaming

we'll have links down below check that out and thank you so much to our friends over there they got a really awesome set of terrain we got to check out actually one other their books they send the to us before and yeah I've used it a few times I'm yea able it's just a good thing to pull out and be like what do I need today and then you flip to the page and there you go we love using terrain in our games we use a lot of 3d terrain but it's really hard to understate how useful portable 2d terrain can actually be especially if you're someone that runs that venturers league in stores or you just don't have a permanent game setup at all but even then that they have so much in that book there's things that you would just never find in actual terrain unless you made it yourself yeah yeah with that let's return to the ruins our heroes after venturing to ember wood village for a pit stop to visit there friends family and vendors had now returned back to the barracks of the hooded lanterns where they are to meet with Lord Commander Elias Drexel and night captain Theodore marshal for the assault on the Cathedral of st. petrulio in the Lord commanders planning room you've gathered with Petra Ansem Virgil the flame keeper Ophelia Reid and several of the other captains and commanders and lieutenants of the two factions to discuss the upcoming plan the Lord Commander defers to you he says we've been fighting now for over a week in the city it's time for something to change we have to move forward to our final goal at least for this phase we're going to retake the Cathedral we're going to have a place in the middle of the city we're gonna change things and we've done it by working together and now we're gonna work together again what's the plan so do we have a map yep all right pointing at the map cuz I'm super serious about this I leaned over the table and look at everybody in the eyes so here's the plan ladies and gentlemen we're gonna move down this street that I'm pointing at right now temple Road temple Road that's the one series down temple Road we are going to stage an attack at the gates of the Cathedral but while we do that a larger force is going to move into Market Square and get in position near slaughter stone square see the attack against the Cathedral is a diversion that's going to draw out the Lord of the feast we're going to take a select group of skilled individuals to aid us in this attack and then we will hole the Lord of the feast back into slaughter stone square where we will blow up all the exits trapping him in there with the executioner at that point the three of us will get out and attack him from afar except Pluto who will stay in slaughter stone square and all that Pluto go from here I'm a guide kill him now if you don't mind me asking what do you all plan on doing about that crazy machine that you got living in the middle of slaughter stone square after this is all over oh that's the wild card I'll leave it there and the hope is is that the in my head and this is important that the Lord of a feast and the slaughter stone golem thing kill each other at the same time and they fall to their deaths and I stand victorious on both of their bodies claiming victory in Jack and I'm and I don't see it pretty much going any other way well I mean if the Lord of the beasts kills the thing then great then we'll just kill him but if not we will leave the scary corpse collector for other times that we could use him yeah cuz I'm confident and he might just be more interested in corpses than us last time I seem that maybe because there wasn't an accord we're kind of now you know it doesn't leave the square it doesn't we ran away from it and we stopped just outside the square and so did it so from our one test we know it will never leave the square ever the Lord Commander speaks we're going to see what we can do about gathering is much debris explosives whatever we can muster netting to just cut off any routes of escape of course it's still possible that they might go into the buildings or anything else like that so we're going to need to draw him right into the center the square and hopefully the executioner can make short work of the Lord of the feast hopefully I've heard some pretty nasty things about Lord of the feast and I know that the corpse collector is nasty so we'll do our best the enemy of our enemy is our friend our frenemies and the executioner is everybody's enemy and the Lord of the feast is also our enemy so they will attack each other and we'll be small and not important to it well then the plan is for you three says the night captain for you three to be the bait yes I see well I'll get you about three fast horses and how do you ride a horse how about are you kidding me boy he can ride on my horse you can write on my horse suit around the o source I got fast horses but it would probably be best then if the two of you wrote together and you and lighter than Pluto Jackson wrote on your own I never took horse riding lessons I was hauled off to school before I got a chance to alright so I'm gonna get together some of my nuts and we'll ride out from temple gate along temple road towards the Cathedral Square and the plan then is to cause a big ol ruckus right outside the Cathedral not in it and then as soon as the Lord of a feast appears we we lure him in to slaughter stone square and while we're creating this distraction it'll give you guys time to move your forces in to slaughter storm Square to prepare the explosives the traps and be ready to take the surrounding Knowles to cut off their escape we're kind of the bait twice here were the bait first to draw the note and all the Noles to the cathedral so that they're not in your way then we draw the lord of the feast back to where you guys are so it's a double all right so we need to cause a bit of a ruckus but just the right amount of ruckus is what I'm hearing we're gonna cause as big of a ruckus as we can outside the cathedral to draw all the nose towards us we ain't going in or we ain't going in to draw the Lord the feast us because once the feasts is there the nose is all crazy they burn our way so wherever he is if he's in the Cathedral if he's in the city as soon as he shows up the plan is to run yes and get to the but make the trace yeah we gotta we want to make it tempting yeah we got a tempting we got a tempting we'll be laying down some basic fire on him literally well we draw him towards so we're always going to try you're gonna get him nice and angry yes cuz he's fast is he faster than a horse is he faster than a cow he's run down some folks on the horses that's not great to hear he's got a real nasty beastie with him too he's not a pet of his own so what I'm hearing is we don't need to actually like stall we can just run full we should are you saying that we should go as fast as possible Oh philia read speaks up I hope that you're gonna be able to from what I can tell the Lord of the feast has been blessed by that well there's a dark power that the Noles swear to and they descent him a terrible gift it's a great beast known as the chuva it's a massive wolf with the tail of a scorpion this why this was not email never even came up once in a dark power has blessed orbitals it was a scary name we've only we've only just started to get a sense of it because we've had people survive coming in to battle with him and until now none of them were able to really describe what it is that they were seeing all Qaeda but once I listened to them and meditated and thought on what I've been told there's many dark and terrible powers that haunt the gnats demons and Lords of Darkness that stole all man or a blessings of on those that worship them and this creature the shuva well the lord of the feast has grown fat big and whatever power they pray to is impressed with him and it sent him one of these creatures from beyond well that same dark power has blessed me too and I have my own beast are you saying you're blessed by some kind of demon that's he didn't mean to say that but it's exactly what he kinda just said that's not turned out like is that is that a no-go you know what maybe in front of the priests lady we're gonna handle this with our light and holy power missus flame keeper I don't wanna fight this she spritzes you with holy water and you like I have a I have an equally impressive beast made of lights and I like what about your what about your shadow dog you mean my light dog if you mean absence let's rewind we got this beast if you wanted to take like maybe like a 12 minute meditation what do you see in our future probably hopefully not would you like me to contemplate on that I what I want to know is when we came with this plan we thought we nailed it you know that there was a new shuva yeah you brought in some really important points we would love your blessing but we want to know what where where do you what advice do you have for us I'm no prophet but way I see it I hope you can run fast I can I can run fast like yes because if you can you're gonna have to fight that thing I can disappear when needed the the night captain speaks up but you're not gonna fight it alone I'm gonna ride with you you are we've had success with that in the past are you sure I will you do realize that in this battle you are more important than we are okay you command an entire army were your strike team the Lord Commander requires not captain with respect you are more valuable than least if no if he stays alive he commands the whole army if he dies the silver order somebody else would know when you lose your general it's not a good thing it takes time to regroup it's true yeah are you I'm not one to lead from the back I know you're not you were in there with us during that temple gate attack you were leading the charge we need you to make sure that your men are ready when that beast shows up in Market Square or slaughter stone square make a persuasion jackin oh why am i falling with advantage just cuz I felt like it done are you trying to convince him not to come yeah I don't think it's a good idea I don't want him to die I think that said more towards we can send some of his best men but I don't think he should go it's a persuasion right 24 he looks down at his sword at his Warhammer he looks locks eyes with Ophelia Reed and backing it looks at his med your rot I just feel I feel like I'm not putting up enough huh tell you what this is gonna sound horrible because I just told you how valuable your life is send Virgil with us and some of your best men I will and maybe Petra Nansen wait what's that what's that laser should stay what about the two gotta give this up the Queen yeah we can we can another one Evelyn yeah totally come or I may have got her name wrong Sutter this a thorough name the other Elena I'm not I was thinking of slain and we need Elena Elena should come with us we need we need good arch I need Elena beside me the whole time no there's no question I need to keep Petra and Elena back yeah bring anthem anthem even says you couldn't keep me from this if you tried good lord commander you did good in the other battle so I'll take you on our side doing like handsome on me all right we set out at dawn cool do you have any snacks what's now y'all should know says if you read it the next step of what we're going to need to do once we're once we've defeated the Lord of the feast we're gonna need to actually take that Cathedral and I have a bit of a plan for what we might be able to do in our faith from the most humble chapter Chapel to the great temple of the first flame we mark each holy side with a great brazier that hosts a manifestation of the sacred fire each is concentrated with the ash and relics of a saint or a martyr or a hero who gave their life to the warning claim that so many vile creatures inhabit our Cathedral means that the flame that burned in Drakon home is long gone it's the same story that we see with every other Chapel or Church throughout the city there's many of them and they've all been put out and extinguished but it's a grave cursed within each Creek crypt below are chapels are the spirits bound to that flame and without that beacon to light their way they grow restless we're gonna need to light that flame again and it will make the cathedral a safe place a bright place a holy place you need something lit on fire the next step hopefully in the crypts below that Cathedral are still there are two great heroes in the history of Dragon hime that were buried below there one of the remains of the martyr but Rubio who the cathedral is named for that might not be left much left of at Rubio his bones were keeping the flame burning in Drakon home for generations but if there's anything of the bones a saint for Trujillo left he would give them winningly there's also the modern silver dragon argh on us his skull and bones are in the crypt as well and if there's anything of either of them left we could use those to reignite the brazier so we get the bones of a hero and a dragon from the crypts we put them in the brazier in the middle of the cathedral set it ablaze and it will help us defeat the Noles no it will keep any monsters or evil from ever coming back to the cathedral again okay why didn't it stop them before well because the fire went out so we're gonna reignite the sacred flame okay but after it taking the Cathedral yes we'll need to do it quickly normally when we do these things the rituals of sanctification take weeks to do properly but we won't have weeks once we ever taken it it will be me and my priests we will have to come to the cathedral for were they only ones that are going to be able to do this and that's going to make for a really stressful couple of hours do you need protection during those hours we will we can do that hopefully we will have dealt with you can do that most of the Noles and Orient Lord of the peas Lord Commander Knight Commander all of the men that we have laughed can hold the cathedral and we will fight until that flame is real it now the question is do you want us to find the bones first and then come to get you or do you want us to bring you and we'll find the bones the night captain speaks up a philia just wants to let you know what's coming we're gonna have to take this one step at a time the first thing first we need to get rid of the biggest threat in the game then we can take the Cathedral and hopefully once we do that we get rid of the Lord of the feast we just hang his head right over the gates of the cathedral and no nose will even dare approach us we want to leave his Pelt in good condition and we'll have to recover his corpse from the corpse collector oh man this is super mission yeah that's your job one health of that what is it called that monster his monster the shoe botch the top of the shoe bow with the scorpion tail might be cool maybe I'll tame the chuva and make it my new mount uh-huh probably not I feel like it's gonna try to stab me multiple times with that scorpion tail and I'm not prepared for it you just gotta break it I have that poison I have a potion of I had an idea that he was gonna be poisonous but I was like maybe the Knoll isn't poisonous but 100% this scorpion tail super poisonous we'll see we'll see we'll see if we need it enough we'll see if we need it oh my gosh okay well take one step at a time kill the Lord of the feast see what happens afterwards and then we'll see what happens just another day in Drakon hein that is the list okay oh boy it's a tense evening as once again everyone mobilizes and the decision is made to send you down to temple gate so that you can rest there for the first thing in the morning did the plan begins at daybreak the Lord Commander already begins assembling his men to take up advanced positions along the way and he gives one last message and says I'm gonna set up a few of my soldiers in Market Square if the Lord of the feast is fast you might need to call in a favor if you do use this and it gives you a flare gun yeah it's basically a big metal almost crossbow like device with a big tube on it and then there's three satchels with it he says you can fire these and we'll see them across the city I've green red and black if you need us if you're being pursued once you're being pursued by the Lord of the feast fire the green flare if you need help while you're being pursued fire the red flare and if you need to abort the mission fire the black clary office do I do I want it or do you guys want it okay that's a big responsibility green red red if we're not doing good black we need to stop green when we're on mission red if we need help during black if it's a bore pork chops if it's a pork chop yeah black is pork chops because they're blackened blackened pork chops chops green means go red means if you're setting up in Market Square you do have access to the clock tower if you want to station some archers and good vantage points we will just don't touch the morons yeah no don't go to the higher floors there's mo Jones and they're busy and if you mean you don't know what those creatures are all right very strange I stay clear of any rats yeah well the rats should all be I hope I hope they done yeah any rats don't they're not a problem don't worry okay how's the mood as your arrived at temple gate as you arrive at temple gate in the evening you can see that there are bodies of Knolls that have been stacked by the sides of the gates that the the nights are burning and you can smell the smell of charred no corpses it's thick in the air they lead you to a chamber in temple gate one of the rooms that you cleared out previously and send you to some comfortable cots where you can get a night's sleep I imagine on Sebastian's looking out the window and he's seeing all of these burning NOLA bodies he turns to you guys he's like you know all in all I'm actually pretty optimistic that's a lot of nulls out there that are being burned it can't be that many left we have probably killed more than half I can't listen I'm trying to be optimistic my confidence is in our skills and I feel like with you guys beside me and except when we leave you and slaughters don't square by yourself by yourself but I myself am yeah I'm not I'm not leaving you by yourself don't worry I won't be within range to get you out of there I appreciate that but you want to kill this thing and I know you do the it's it's what I find is that am I gonna murder it and and I'm gonna do it protecting you guys do you remember the first thing you said to me when we met I said hi that's correct and how it was right after your entire crew had been killed and I came in and helped you out and we were deciding that maybe it was good to work together I mean I had already decided that you had just said hi and I said hello my name is Sebastian Crowe and I have just rescued you okay all right you said my name is Pluto Jackson and there's nothing I can't kill except these rats that just killed all my friends and I took those words to heart Pluto Jackson and I believe you that there's nothing you can't kill you've inspired me that was the point I feel 100% you know what there's nobody else that could do this right you're the only one am I gonna kill so many things good I'm gonna kill one or stone a square full of things our job is to keep him alive I mean I want to keep myself alive too well we're gonna be fine he's the one who's just gonna hang out in the middle of slaughter stone square so yeah question yeah do I fire at the null or do i fire at the clips collector yeah that's actually I think we assess when they when they attack each other we assess which one looks like it's losing and we attack the one that's winning okay can you do you have like a wall even Walt flaming you put up this oh yes I was even thinking of encircling cage match we don't want to let the corpse collector beat on the knoll no we do okay we're gonna cage match the two of them the null and the corpse collector yes good match I'd pay to see that you do we're going for free I'd if I'm strong enough I'm on the VIP list that's my little Jackson you're not asked at all but you are strong so strong my shirt your makeup and my slow please be good on a horse well let's go to bed sleep time that you get one light night's rest and in the morning after taking your breakfast virgil underwood gets you up with his other nights this is all right y'all ready to go virgil it's good to see your mustache can I get likewise can I get some more javelins sure thing you got a few more he need any ammunition let's saddle up the lower command the Lord Commander is gonna be waiting and then that captain sent some fast horses for ya it's Ansem with us he's gonna what I understand he's gonna be following clothes waiting for you to fire that red flare if he needs some help let's go serve up some humble guy well let's go set things on fire so here's the plan we've got about we've got the cavalry all assembled about 40 of us all said we're gonna all charge together down temple road till we get to the the street that leads to the main plaza of the cathedral itself once we get there we're gonna break into two groups splitting off one come from the west the other come from the east caused a bit of a ruckus caused a fight that we can and as soon as we catch sat of the Lord of the feast most of us are going to retreat to leave you to bait them out sound good sounds great the rest of us then are gonna reassemble it temple road and make our way towards slaughter stone square so while you're on the run run through the Market Square it's not gonna be the silver order support yeah it's gonna be the hooded lanterns so you use that flair when you need their help you got it got it got it all right saddle up let's go you know can you help me I pull you up I like the back of their coat onto like the back of the worse how strong are you not very strong and it's a struggle I'm gonna push I push you I think I've done it because I don't see you help push him up like oh my god I'm so strong push push my butt and then I was like oh oh maybe I'm not strong you're so strong did you just one hand me onto a horse I did it mostly with my like my thumb and forefinger actually because I'm holding something in that end too so I can hold something in that in and push you it's fine you're not that heavy well thank you all right okay so there's the pair of horses for you guys and then I've got the cavalry of the Calvary the silver order coming in from there so you're gonna ride so valiantly the gates of temple gate when you get up in the morning you assemble outside temple gate on the city on the outskirts of this on the side that's outside the city gates and so they have this column of the knights that are all lined up two abreast to ride through the gates and then the plan is once they're all through the gates they're going to form up into a formation three wide with the three of you with the two of you well because you're two units two sets of horses basically protected in the middle by all the Knights so they're gonna charge forward and Virgil says all of us together we're just going to trample or anybody in our path you got it got it we're not gonna stop to fat we're just gonna run go through them if anybody goes down they do well we're not gonna make it very far if we stop we have to get to the cathedral gate understood all righty you're already up there this is Virgil and with that the gates the doors of temple gate swing open and the portcullis raises up on both sides here Virgil take out a horn and he blows it go forth follow the flame and there is once again the galloping hooves as they trot as you rush through temple gate along the main temple road which is actually an area of the city that you've never been into before on this side I stop and take not rushing past the ravages of this battle of the battles have been fought in this area you run down temple road towards the center of the temple ward ironically in its time this part of the city was known for having a lot of bars they used to people would call it the temple bars and there was a lot of good drinking to be had in this area although an equally large amount of cloisters monasteries Abbey's and various other smaller churches where people would congregate youth under a long temple road towards the heart of the temple ward before breaking off of temple road itself which actually the temple road goes straight to slaughter stone square if you follow it directly there you actually have to turn off on one of the saw on one of the other main streets to get to the cathedral that heads towards the the cathedral plaza properly and so as you do so there's your group splits off about half of the group splits off towards the side street and another group goes towards another one of the secondary streets so that one group will come from the west and one from the east you're the group that's going to be approaching from the west side of the cathedral plaza you Thunder through the streets and as you do so you can hear the yelps and howls of the Deaf dogs and the Noles alerting the other Knolls in the area to your presence once in a while you can hear the sound of an arrow bouncing off the armor of the armored column of the knights as you charge towards it's not very long because with this many groups going down the roads it's rough terrain and sometimes they have to compress or open up depending on how much debris is in the street but they make you make a very good time and it is only about ten minutes of charging on horseback before you begin coming up on the cathedral plaza the great Cathedral of Saint a trivial looms large as you enter into the massive plaza and before you you can see in the heyday of Drakon hein this was one of the busiest areas of the city not because it was a market but because it was a major attraction of worshippers and people that would come from miles around and there was still a lot of business to be done here there is a massive open plaza where the city buildings form this rough shape around the cathedral itself which is a massive basilica style building it is made of marbled stone which has been stained by soot blood and dust covering over the painted frescoes which decorate the outside of the grand Cathedral the cathedral itself used to glitter in the daylight from all of the marble and mosaic and the stained glass and in fact when the flame burned brightly in it it was almost like the building itself glowed with light through the stained-glass windows that are high and around it the rooftop of the building is it's this long building that then goes out that encompasses the nave the building itself is about a hundred feet high throughout the nave which is the where most of the worshipers would stand and then it connects to this massive bulbous chancel which is where the dome itself is so there's the big high roofs that go back and then meet the dome which is that almost itself 270 feet high the tops of it are decorated in broken statues gargoyles depicting the Saints and the martyrs of the sacred fire and many chimneys because of course burning flames and candles were very common so the rooftops have all these chimneys to ventilate all the heat that would come out of it there are three doorways that lead into the front of the Cathedral the center most one was often sometimes nicknamed the door of paradise because it is this large square door embossed with gold which is which cut which depicts the various scenes that tell the story of the creation of the world as those of the the sacred fire believe it across from the doorways of the Cathedral there is a ruined circular building this used to be a home to a font a sacred font of water but the whole thing has been collapsed and you can see that it looks like a piece of the meteor might have crashed and hit into it and destroy the building beside the the cathedral itself is that another square bell tower that stretches up about 250 feet in height known for the seven bells of Saint patru the which used to ring out throughout the city and start the chorus of bells for the churches in the city itself the whole plaza though is a scene of carnage for various camps of desperate Knowles have formed around here creating their own pyres where they are smoking the meat of their most recent victims four throughout the battles that have been fought over the coming weeks the Noles have taken their share of prisoners and you can see the slaughtered remains of hooded lanterns and silver order paladins caught up and strung up butchered for meat as the Noles feast over them and smoke the remains of them there are several large pyres in this area and collected in the plaza at the steps of the cathedral itself are at least two dozen Knowles with many more in this area the thunder of the cavalry meets from both sides and the Knowles howl grab rush for their weapons and turn to attack will furnish no it's all up to you it's a lot of goals we're just gonna charge through kill as many as we can and stay on your horse stay on my horse stay on your horse and then as soon as the big bad boy comes out we run away run away we not so good on our airstrikes attached to my horse sale 10 Pluto 16 Sebastian 4 okay yes it is the day sir we're wrong always it's always the TASIS for the dyes fault oh I'm not sure it's the sound of your craft whose name by the way is now Crowley okay so I've rolled initiative for the chuva and the Lord of the feast and I will roll randomly to determine if they are aroused each round I don't know if the Shiva shows up and the Lord of the feast doesn't we don't we don't run no no okay you may choose which direction you want to approach from are we placing ourselves at the edge of a OH I can decide I'm just clinging to you for dear life this is this will represent Virgil and this will represent this is Virgil's friend flame keeper Hannah who is written with you and then these are the other knights as you enter the square flame keeper Hana Cass bless on the three of you yay you were good to roll an extra d4 for pretty much everything not damage this is the tax the tax and ability checks and saving time saving for us oh okay yeah true not names like not weapon you got it ready and if you guys can place these two yep and are we still writing in formation yep you are all still right the formation is kind of fanned out as you come in now and it is go time we start at the very top with Pluto Jackson so your mouth the axe on your initiative and you can have your mount take the Dodge disengage or - actions so it's it's initiative matches yours ok my mount will take the dodge action ok I'm gonna stay in formation ok and I'm gonna Huck a javelin at the first one of my spare javelins nice grub am and I get an 11 the javelin goes completely wide and lands on the ground beside the knoll and I go ha ha and I throw another one and I get a 14 that collides with the knoll there it is there's the money and for a big old 7 damage that leaves the knoll bloodied as then as the javelin pierces through its side and lands on the ground beside it or pardon 8 damage pardon ok 8 damage yeah anything else Pluto no okay next up Shuba is the Shuba roused by the one chaplain it is not I'll throw my J next up is Vail yeah I'm not writing I mean okay so vo controller passenger yep and that it can still move of course yeah it has a speed of 60 feet I think 60 years at 40 let me check like I wanted to stay in formation yeah like so can I stay with the pack on my turn like I don't want to move like 60 feet ahead and then everyone catch up is that okay yeah yeah the warhorse has a speed of 60 feet and all these war horses normally a war horse has an armor class of 11 but these are barded steeds they're wearing the equivalent of chainmail so they've in a sea of 60 oh nice um yeah we're gonna we're gonna dodge okay with the horse and also stay where we are information because I feel like that's the best kind of piece going forward and then I'm gonna take some attacks I got three tacks in my first action and as my bonus action I am going to sucker strike it's an advantage nice with my new longbow and I twirl this now - yeah okay oh yeah I didn't roll that even should've and I'm gonna show our snow as well okay right 22 hits him right in the gut for how much damage can it be less than 20 I want her to roll it okay technically it's been a while plus he's definitely dead but roll to find out by how much to get sneak attack because you got advantage and don't forget to add your extra one for not a dice but just our plus one for your bow oh it already okay what did we what did we create a good team 8:32 not even so the null is still of negative 18 [Laughter] yeah as it is shot through the stomach which the force of the arrow rips out the lower part of its spine sending bone fragments all over the street that's my first okay I'll go for the next one who's closest don't forget your Oh 21 is a hit 20 damage the next arrow I can actually say that the next arrow carries through the path of the previous one catching the next null in the neck and he spins around and collapses to the ground and then third yep that's 24 24 also a hit three for three they are rides forth and deftly from horseback shoots down three of the Noel's schools okay the Noles intern they'd be seeing you approach several of the Noles move forward around this around the square and begin their approach not that far there yeah thank you thank you thank you every deadline they are arrows and oh the Noles are coming and with that they respond by taking up their ranged weapons and firing back towards the armored column and I've got eleven Noel's down there so everybody gets shot once basically and then they get disadvantage on us because we dodged they get disadvantage against your medal but they're shooting the riders I get a fifteen against Sebastian a 23 against Pluto and a seven against Vale so cast shield and hit on me okay that is gonna be six points of piercing damage there are several more arrows fly towards the crowd of the assembled Knights oh my god and four of the Knights are shot leaving them bloodied Oh guys do all the all the brown ones yeah yeah they don't have great yep Virgil is not hit and flame keeper Hannah is not hit however so next up is Sebastian you think you're all cool with your bow let me show you how it's really done and I her chup a little bit on the horse and I point my wand out towards this group of Noel's and I'm gonna fireball them nice the fireball templates in the door behind you hit second one down you got cuz we gotta use the right one yep yeah so that's five Noel's under the template yes cool one succeeds in save but the remainder do not borrowing thank you okay here we go fireball I like that I'm happy with that I don't think I need to reroll any of those so that's 30 damage to all of them so one survives but the rest all died he oh the the one that survives is very badly burned okay and anything else Sebastian nice variable I know that's it okay with that the silver order musters forward and charges forward I think the only one that's gonna be able to get up to anybody is Virgil so Virgil's gonna move up to the closest Knowles which is the one yeah bye yep and he charges in with his Lance running through the Knoll the burn Knoll all the others the whole cavalry column moves up to measure Utley with with Virgil as well does that include us moving in the form if you guys wanted to stay in formation then yes go pony they're probably done good so I'm naming him Pony on the other side of the plaza you can hear that the other group of cavalry has engaged the Knowles and you can see that there's two that many of the other Knowles in this area are still trying to figure out what is going on with the lightning strike that has struck them in this in the square next the Lord of the feast how many Knowles have been killed so far eight and you did cast firewall yes okay trying to make a spectacle here oh nice thought I'd start with the big go so make it flash the Lord of the feast has not been roused guys I think I found a name for my bow no skewer no sorry no said it out loud didn't peel right I'll get it I can't clears out keep exploring please keep exploring your other options we go to the top of the round with pollute Oh Jackson I I want to write a little bit ahead and get and catch one of them with my sword nice and give it the old razzle-dazzle swinging from that swinging for the fences getting a 18 to hit that is a hit for 15 no 14 damage 14 damage it Cleaves through the skull of the null and he collapses to the ground yeah and and I'm gonna kind of keep riding kind of towards Virgil and hit that next one trying to swing again like a 22 to hit 411 damage cool that leaves him bloodied and then my horsey is gonna take the Dodge action cool and can I on a bonus action blow the horn they gave me further for the temple the the horn not the flare not the flare remember the horn sure you blow the horn I'm gonna give that a horn like okay a good blow I'm gonna add that to the rousing cherry the Shuba oh just in time for the Shuba just in time for the chuva the gates the the the front doors of the grand temple of saint retrouve Oh crash open and from it comes for Noel's bigger dramatic and a massive snarling white-furred beast a billowing fetid cloud of smoke pours out from the cathedrals doors as a massive creature something like the cross of a wolf and a scorpion walks out the gate it has a ma that as it opens its mouth glows with flame inside an eyes a burning pitch as these spines and armored plates and bits and Tufts of white fur cover its back and its spines across it except you can see that two of the spines in the middle of its back have been shorn off in a very awkward fashion behind it instead of this furry wolf's tail it has this massive armor scorpion-like tail that rises over its back like the cross between a tentacle and a scorpions stinger it bursts forth out of the room out of the the cathedral and charges towards pollute oh it does so it breathes out this billowing smoke that surrounds all of it in the area around it and you can feel the frenzy rising in the Noles okay i taunt at it and now i want to untie it it comes up to bite you hello getting a 12-2 hit whew missing as it bites I'll put you its tail stinger Rises back up with a low puncture getting a 15 hit I deflect it with my shield okay epically in my back the other nulls leap forward and two of them leap off the steps towards Sebastian and veo attacking with their swords Sebastian I get a 15 to hit you in a critical hit and Vale another leaps towards you I get a 12 and a 9 nope I'm gonna I'm gonna cast shield again to block the non crit and the crit deals 10 points of slashing damage is one of the Noles races up and stabs you in the side and Sebastian you can give me an athletics check to stay in the shot saddle oh wait athletics yes zero Sebastian your ascent you're flung off the horse and two of the Noel's surround you on on the ground as two of the others one of them leaps towards flame keeper Hannah hitting her and she is sent flung off her horse on the ground beside you and another the final null leaps onto one of the soldiers and who manages to push him off with it with his shield next up is bail all right I take a look at this shoe of AX I say shuva out of the way and I'm focused on your name in your bow don't worry yeah yeah oh nine to hit it bounces off it's our word plate I take it again Oh 24 oh wait we have the last right yeah 20 that it hit 21 damage ouch the Shuba howls in rage as as the arrow punctures its side and turns its gaze right towards you locking eyes with you like a hungry dog that sees a mangy cat and I'm not based with it correct no I'm going to run the horse 60 feet around to the other side near the red cart okay I'm like come over here chuva alrighty next up are the Noles so two of so some of the Noles acted on the shoe of this turn but they're still too active on the ground that that Letty their attacks against pollute oh the highest of the first is only a 16 one blow manages to penetrate for 5 / language there's also those three guys over there those three guys over there they turn their bows towards veil Virgil and pollute oh so one shot against each did you do Virgil is missed pollute oh is missed veil I get an 18 yep one of the arrows strikes you for ten points of piercing damage next up is Sebastian you are on the ground by the abandoned by veo she ran away from you you don't have a horse that I'm trying to fight yeah there's no I'm going to okay are they like base with me right now yeah do i I can stand up though yeah yeah okay I stand up I have a crow I grab my crow and I throw it I don't even let him fly in the face curly go and I throw them at the closest nolé and i am going to then cast scorching ray that no yes okay so I get advantage which is negates the disadvantage because it's base with you oh yes okay 20 20 is a hit alright so first shot is gonna do five damage okay second one nineteen that hits ten more damage he's destroyed yeah crowed in his face micro one more shot left which is no longer based yet right could the control he fly into his face too or no trollee can only give you a grant to advantage once okay yeah all right 27 against the next Knoll yeah 11 damage he is slain and so I stand up throw my crow in their faces and when the what both of them look at the car I'm just like there's an explosion of flame and too charred anole bodies fall to the ground and then hop on my horse you're based with two more Knowles I'm gonna hop on this guy's horse okay he scoops you up a cost um she you have to spend half your movement to do so and you spent half your movement to get up from prone so you actually won't be able to get onto someone's horse this turn because you don't have enough movement to do it I turn back to the charging guys and I'm like pick me up and that's what I do the silver order [Music] two of the one of the Knights of the silver order scoops you up Sebastian two of the others charge forward towards the Noles in front of them Krita one yeah and running him through completely my man I got actually Virgil comes up to help flame keeper Hannah and charges one of the Noles their slang it nice and two of the other silver order members charged over to the Knowles over here over here yeah yeah they have to spend all their movement to get over there but they're good now they're anywhere Knowles over there for them to attack there's one more a yes this one here they hit and slay it woo silver order pulling their weight cool Virgil turn turns and helps flame keeper Hannah back to her horse and she rushes over to the other side no towards the ruins yep yep they're great this is bad okay the Lord of the feast do we got him do we got them stepping from the smoke inside comes a hulking No standing almost eight and a half feet tall is a massive null carrying with him dragging behind the sound of clinking chains as coming forward from the the Gateway is this massive animate chain swinging around on the tops of which are tipped three ayran balls that spikes of delirium shards have been embedded inside them as this Knoll steps out of the gates in his other hand he carries a huge shield and across his spiked armor are just heads have been just embedded on the spikes of his of his armor and the the face plate itself is the skull of a chimera that he is wearing over his helm as he does so he howls and several more Noel's come around the corner from either side filled with bloodlust there's so much stuff that we have to take after an aura of blood thirst fills the Noles and the chuva as almost a supernatural connection rises up between the two of them as the lord of the feast comes out he attacks with his flails which swing forward he has a reach of twenty feet so he moves forward one sends a flail attack one against virgil and one against pluto getting a natural one against pollute oh I appreciate that and a 22 against Virgil and then he'll do another one against Pluto hello for a 25 there it is a hit so Pluto you are hit with the flail of pain sound good name you know what it seems appropriate I like my first time you know you take six points of bludgeoning damage and then now you're gonna take forty ten psychic damage as the Delirium shards rushed through your body twenty-two psychic damage ow run away I say the flail and virgil is hit by the flail of paralysis and he takes fifteen points of bludgeoning damage and has to make a constitution saving throw which he fails and was paralyzed and he falls from his horse with that the lord of the feast leaps off the steps and lands on the back of the Shuba and is riding it what happened well we got him out technically we did the thing we were supposed to but now that one has run what about Virgil Ron the plan is to run we I'm on a stranger's horse Virgil said we can't don't worry about a plan I got a plan all right Sebastian that oh no it's not special its Pluto it's your turn or if you wall me generalize um you go to the top of the round there's delirium in my brain and I go I've been here before I got delirium on the mind am I gonna hook my javelin of lightning at chuva nice suck it up princess dog and I go this dog's about I don't see anything cool cuz I got so much to learn him in my head um I get a 23 to hit and I didn't activate it lightning thing and I want to maneuver just a little bit closer to that vert to the flame keeper so I want like the lightning thing to go right through that Avenel that anole him and hit the yep jazz mmm with the savings row for the I think it's a 1313 the NOLA fails the shuva fails and the Lord of the feast fails so 13 lightning damage okay vaporizes the null the Shuba appears to not really mind getting shocked electrically and I want to and then damage on her for 10 damage okay and I'm gonna do trip attack on the shuva yeah okay it's a strength saving true uh yeah I get a 21 you are so strong um and she's gonna take another five damage okay and then I can call back the yep javelin and I got a Huck it at her again okay yes because we got a getting a 826 to hit to hit for eight damage nice and roll another strength save I get a 14 she is prone she is not prone and the Lord of the feast falls prone as well yeah and now we ride and I'm gonna ride towards I'm gonna yell run and get Virgil and so I'm gonna start making my way walking fast that's the piano riff the shuva writes itself from prone oh and is one extra seven more damage and trip attack it just rushes right to her it's just Russia's rate at Vail because she because it she it was the last more I'd wanted and Virgil's on the ground paralyzed so it goes rate for veo on the on the horse leaps forward fee I'm sorry getting a 16-2 hit with its bite yes okay that is going to be 15 points of piercing damage and then it launches its tail Stinger at you getting a 13 it no [Laughter] [Music] we don't get okay an opportunity attack from the yeah and so because it's disengaged you if you move with it you'll be fine as well yeah you won't provoke because you're not moving your mount is with it and your mounts disengagement okay then as a bonus section I am going to we're gonna move away at least a couple of feet towards Pluto towards Pluto yeah okay um but I want still want to keep it because as we go to run away I'm gonna take my two shots at it because I might kill the shuh-shuh-gah and with Zephyr strike as I cast it I get my advantage 21 two hits two hits nice okay whoa way better less time shooter shuva I wanted to yell like veo bring that down thirty-nine damage I doing it oh my god thirty-nine damage Shuba Slayer and the Lord of the feast dies from so the shuva is bloodied oh boy I take a second shot at it no no sorry okay and I continue to run away the rest of my movement okay I'm like all righty I'm like gearing up to teleport on to your horse and you just like leave and I'm like more of the Knowles file into the square in overwhelming numbers two of them attacking this member of the silver order don't give me more three times and he is pulled from his horse and slain two more Knowles rushed forward one shooting at Sebastian once shooting at the one at his rider Sebastian I get a 15 against you and a 20 against your rider so the night that's with you is shot in the neck and dies and falls off his horse and now I'm on his horse yes and you're you're hit for seven damaged and several more Knowles come out of the front of the Cathedral and leap upon Virgil who's paralyzed and they crit him uh-oh and crit him three times four times five times and Virgil is torn to shreds by the pack of Knowles as he lays paralyzed in front of the Cathedral he got maced like real hard oh man all my support has just gone away and I'm just on a horse yeah and flame keeper Hannah screams out we have to move now there's too many of them go go go okay Sebastian it's your turn I attempt okay I got this I grabbed the reins of the horse and with a look of pure panic genuine authentic panic in my eyes I ride into this null and then I grab the horse by the mane and I Thunder stepped me in the horse nice yeah killing Virgil yeah I should get this home yeah Rose I think one succeeds all right under step 3 D 10 yeah not to come yeah he would have probably been Virgil yeah sorry Virg 14 damage to all of them many of them are bloodied one of them is slain but actually there that it's not enough to kill all them no my dramatic exit didn't work guys let's get out of here I'm riding a horse the lord of the feast stands up from prone walks forward towards the and fires his flail out at these three paladin's hitting all three of them and hitting flame keeper Hannah and that's the first one gets the flail of pain and it just ripped apart by the flail the second one gets the flail of madness and fails his wisdom saving throw and has to and basically with the flail of madness he goes crazy and starts stabbing his own horse that's insane and flame keeper Hannah gets hit by the flail of paralysis oh no and she fails her saving throw against the flame of paralysis and falls from her horse he's good I mean he's alive he's stabbing his horse but he's alive so what you're saying is we don't have bless anymore yes okay flame keeper Hannah well she's alive right um did we are we winning I don't know the plan is working whatever we're doing is working I don't know if we're winning but the plan is working Virgil's dead I think Steve the shuva is that he's bloodied man is dead those know she's dead let's get out of here do you want to start running now yes I do look back to try to see if he's following okay pollute Oh what are you gonna do I want to sound a retreat horn okay you do so and and are you gonna fire the flare does he is I don't know if he's gonna pursue us yet that's the only thing like do you think he's coming I can still continue to shoot him in the face and see if he gets annoyed at it yeah like that's what I'm thinking too like this just keep sucking javelins like my effective range on javelins thirty feet so I'm gonna Huck another javelin at at shuva okay eighteen that's a hit for nine damage okay Huck another one crit oh my god for twelve damage and I want to [Music] I want to distract things straight okay on chuva so on the crit so you roll the damage twice yeah damage so is 13 plus 6 9 9 twice oh I roll that twice - 19 20 21 in total that kills the shuva what happens I get one of the javelins gets like in one of its paws and it kind of like as it looks down I catch it right in the eye with the next one so it looks down to kind of deal with it and then the next just comes in and it just goes straight into its brain as the chuva falls to the ground and begin smoldering the lord of the feast looks up and it says in infernal you are my madelung and I yell back and infernal cuz I speak infernal I yelled come get me cob get me and he looks at the Shuba and says crayons what that means who knows Dale what are you gonna do oh and then I'm gonna ride I'm gonna ride but again I I turn around backwards saddle on the horse trusting that it's not gonna run me into anything and I take two more shots at the Lord of the feast nice and you guys are we're moving right 17 did it that is a Miss nope okay missed and then I'm just like just like annoying more by shooting arrows I don't guys are pretty much off the screen at that yeah we're gonna - Sebastian what are you gonna do I'm gonna - with my horse and I'm gonna fling a fire bolt at the lord of the feast go for it this will get them it's sales past his head and hits one of the gargoyles outside the Cathedral and I yell that was a warning shot and then I fly away as you ride off you see a small life knoll in robes come out the front of the Cathedral she carries a shard of delirium in her hand a large piece and the lord of the feast regards her as she comes out she stabs the shard of delirium into the shuva and kasra vivify and as she then turns to cast another healing spell on it the lord of the feast regards his raised mount hops on back and begins his pursuit we got a move and that's where we're gonna end and he mad now we made a mad what a great way to start back after I'm sweating I'm sweating like I was so nervous we lost Virgil yeah we lost a lot of people and flame keeper Hannah flame keeper Hannah she had a name but you talked you talked the loge commander out of dying yeah he could have died he probably would have died oh man we did that was good I had I was fully gonna use my Thunder step to get Virgil out of there but he was ripped apart imagine imagine Sebastian like gets knocked off the horse kills the tune Knowles reaches to teleport onto your horse and you're like leaving he turns to Virgil and he's like don't worry and then he sees Virgil get ripped apart and he's like alright I'm on a horse now and then the guy you're gonna get shot the neck like
