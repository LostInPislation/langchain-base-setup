we're gonna be rolling with them tonight and with that we will return to the ruins when last we left our heroes after a series of tense infiltrations negotiations misadventures and near disasters bloodied and beaten with very few hit points remaining and low on spell slots after slogging all the way across the city over the walls and into the hooded lanterns barracks they have finally come to an accord yay yay our heroes have broken their deals with Oscar urine and he has fled in disgrace Queen Lenore the former mana one of the former monarchs of Drakon Heim is now secure in the Shepherd's gate barracks with the hooded lanterns and our heroes seemed to have mended the broken relationship that they had with the hooded lanterns as the day winds down after all the chaos has been wrought the GUP to up ruins of Sten are wiped up from the street night falls and you are able to take your well-deserved rest reflecting back on your adventures of the day now level 7 and what have you all picked up with your new level okay so veo has taken another road level and now she has cunning action yes how are you going to decide what to do with all your bonus actions there's so many options now between Zephyr strike now - disengage and hide I'm gonna see how it goes in the moment yeah yeah I'm excited for that yeah Sebastian has gained a fourth level spell and it's decided to take Holly more for more so Kelly has decided that Sebastian will take polymorph Sebastian doesn't know what powers he has yet but he feels more powerful and he will maybe turn into some animals or turn other people in animals we'll find out yeah I really like this idea that sorcerers don't really know what spells are gonna manifest I wanted to play into that more that like a certain emotion is gonna come out and I spell that he's never cast before we'll just happen and he's like oh I can do this now so we'll see how that works in yeah I'm looking forward to seeing how that plays out Pluto Jackson got smarter no my enemy I can I'm gonna size everyone up and down and determine if they are stronger or weaker than me in multiple different categories and also I took to new maneuvers as a battle master maneuvering strike and a maneuvering attack and distracting strike so I hope to give Vale all types of advantage look over here over here and and let her run around and just keep murdering the whole team dynamic is to let Vale murder it's to see how much damage veo can do on one attack and every every attack is about beating the record from the last attack we can get that's why I attack myself when I can help veo attack more so we're excited for that unsurprisingly Sebastian Pluto and veo you have been permitted by the Lord Commander Elias Drexel of the hooded lanterns to stay in the key of the hooded Lantern's barracks where the upper apartments have been converted over from their former offices many of which have not been used since the heyday of the city into a set of apartments for Leonor and those who will be protecting her the as the day dies down the Lord Commander offhandedly says I never thought we'd see the return of the Royal Guard in my lifetime but all those who know the queen is here Ansem and Petra I'm reassigning them formally to the dragon I'm Royal Guard though I think we have a couple of their old old blue and purple Greenline cloaks down in in storage so we'll have to get those ones out it's a good step forward for the city I gotta say my my plan going forward for all of you the Lord Commander says is you're welcome to take a shift on guard duty I don't expect Vale will be able to get too too far away from the Queen at this rate anyways at least until I am summoned a way for other business to help put Drakon home the way it was I haven't been on guard duty in a really long time I've never been on guard duty I sounds boring it's exceptionally boring but the first night you're so exhausted anyways that I imagine beyond veo no the two of you will take up the I I am sleeping straight through the night good long sleep having a nice nappy nap I'm staying up and thinking about my actions that caused a certain face to melt and I have to own that I have to live with that and I'm over it Oh over it as long as you don't melt anybody else's amazing yeah yes I've already scraped stand-up nobody remembers him anymore like it's in the morning you are awoken to the sound of revelry from a bugle as they are playing the last rites for Sten down sit down in the courtyard below Pluto they do still remember they remember you were trying to kill me I'm like nobody will remember the more can come and oh boy Petra says as she heads out Anselm's taking guard duty if you want to come out to the courtyard and pay your respects to stand we couldn't really scrape up everything we managed to get a little bit of him we think it might be some bone so at least his family has something okay is it an open casket no but it's at least one of the other hooded lanterns we'll take it back to his wife and children in amberwood village just think of it like he's been cremated oh yes you helped speed up the cremation process was alive perfectly down in the courtyard many of the hooded lanterns are are assembled in in a rough block as the you can already over here that the distance the Lord Commander is just saying a few words the last right of the of the hooded lanterns it seems to be a ceremony that perhaps in its heyday would have been a way of remembering one of the city watch who died in the service of the city but it gives you an idea of just how few hooded lanterns there are many of them are arrayed in the courtyard which there's a couple dozen of them maybe no more than a hundred based on the group of them that are all lined up here and the others that are still tending to their guard posts this is not a lot of people but they all show that kind of grim determination on their faces as the Lord Commander speaks Petra leads you forward and says as the the Lord Commander speaks up and says with that we'll take our breakfast together and if any one of you would like to come up here to the platform and say your last words instead zhannar say some words instead is honor please do so he served our city well should I open with a joke do you want me to like Herald you in maybe yeah ladies and gentlemen I present the gracious humble handsome murdering very kind Pluto Jackson he's never laid a finger on any innocent people on purpose there is not much applause from the Assembly of the great and mighty troll killer himself you head up to the platform where the hooded lanterns are standing before and on a small pedestal in a metal bucket our what our abstence idli stands remains you stand in front of the assembled hooded lanterns Pluto and they all I you up to Sten his curiosity was only matched by his inability to survive the goo we will remember euston for your your your childlike wonder in poking things with your hand I didn't know you long and I don't really know you now but what I would say is I'm sorry thank you I see a kelp Academy right make a performance check one Sebastian at this point he like turns to face the hooded lanterns any sir I'm nobody solid one weight without the Lord Commander you see get off the stage you didn't know him I walk away so I I walk away proud but like knowing that I don't know what I shouldn't have been there I realized a little bit of regret no I shouldn't have said anything there's a few others that speak and as you as you come down Petra says that was a little uncalled for Pluto I I think I'm just a little nervous well at least you said you were sorry thanks for whatever it's worth oh yeah no problem did I say I'm sorry few others get up and Petra says we're gonna take some time this morning to have breakfast and remember Stan take whatever time you need I think the commander wants to meet with you all in the afternoon though deal sounds good I'm uh I'm gonna give Petra fifty gold pieces and it's a it's a college fund for stends son or daughter she looks down to the bag of gold and she says this is a lot of money I hope he gets into college or she or whatever they want to do maybe they want to be a bard I didn't have anything against that I didn't say there's anything wrong with that you can't buy back his life but at least his family will have comfort for the time being I'll take it to them Thank You Petra and you could have bought so many things with ever money it's a it's it's the least I can do there's less that you could do but I see what I see your point good gesture but I mean not there and the group would have been a better judge sir all right thank you I spilled it that's what happened we'll go with that it was like a it's like a like a oil crisis thing well I'm taking responsibility but like a kind of spilled on its own so like all the tape but it's like we're really not my fault I else tend to poke it anyway my important question how's my hair situation your hair is starting to grow back like it does it grow back quickly or at a normal rate it's growing back at an accelerated rate good by the end of the day right now weird yep minor illusion nice hair so you receive word that in a few hours the Lord Commander plans to meet with the three of you again and Lenore to discuss next steps how do you want to pass the afternoon I want to sit down with both of you and just kind of reflect on what we could what we've done so far we've done a lot since we've been here you walking out on the wall and I kick our legs over the edge yeah yeah I'll come but I I had very important plans this morning okay all right I was gonna look for a nice lounge chair and read in my mum's spell book you can read your mom spell book while we're on the wall kicking our legs yeah that sounds like a nice place to lounge wouldn't you it I would love to see if there's anything I can learn from your own spell book too yeah I have no idea how to read spells I only was in school for a little bit we put our heads together we can figure it out yeah we'll figure something out yeah cool so you head up to the battlements of Shepherds gate kind of sit up on the crenellations themselves overlooking the city one of the high towers of the of the fortification it's not quite the same as the view from the clock tower but it gives you a pretty good perspective of both the surrounding area outside the city and this part of town and a clear view towards both the Cathedral of st. Petruchio and towards Queens Park and the Tower of the amethyst Academy the castle of dragon hide looms in the distance as does the other towers of the abbey of Saint Selina across the river as well and there's always still that glow from the crater even in the daylight we've been through a lot so far since being here and I'm interested to see where this all leads I don't know how dragon is gonna end up are you worried about the big fight a little I'm more worried about what happens after the fight and if something happens where you know a faction gets hold of the city yeah it's you know when the monsters leave someone's gotta take space you know so it's we get to kind of I guess decide I think so far a little bit I mean as long as the paladins have to have said they're not going to burn down all of dragon hime they seem actually like decent people the hooded lanterns although a little aggressive are fighting for the right cause the amethyst Academy I mean I I grew up with them I don't quite know what their goals are yet but they had a place on the city before they taught me to harness my powers and I respect them for that they've they've done a lot for me so I we don't know much about the cult of the falling fire though they seem like nice people we hope they seem nice a little crazy but they kept talking about heroes coming back to track and hime and I mean you're here we're here that's true mm-hmm you're a hero too and what if what if they like they they could be guided yeah like maybe they just maybe they just need a little bit of a nudge in the right direction and they can be a great thing for track so what we've decided is we're on the side of all of the factions except the Queen's men and the Noles are the Noles of faction no there are more monsters but oh these can be factions yeah I think I'd be worried about you know yeah I could do without Knowles and minotaurs and stuff but Bratz the rat links they gotta stay got a make sure we make it house home for them here you think anybody in dragon hime any leader is going to let us keep the ratlines around I mean sometimes you don't have a choice when rats stick around like a lot of the time you just don't get to choose rats just kind of sewers like I've had rats and caspia for years we try to get rid of them they just don't go away talking rats no regular rats so I could assume talking cats are much more difficult to upend and relocate I also kill more people mm-hmm but they can reason with I mean such scared em if we let the rats take the sewers is the new dragon hi I'm going to have occasional rat murders merchants you just have to balance how many rat murders are we okay with I'm up to like a dozen a year I'm probably good with a dozen you that's like one a month that's like pretty good numbers more adventures died two trolls every day then rattling it's just you should just know not to go near the sewers that should just be don't go in the sewers don't go in near the sewer grates after dark but what if they need maintenance should the rattling be the main this is a very deep conversation I think we need you have this deep conversations now the rattling may impact the future economics of the city of Drakon hi one of the hooded lanterns pages comes and says it's time for your meeting with the Lord Commander oh wow we spent this whole time talking about rattling they're very important to the future city of Dragon haim but I guess we should talk about the now city of Dragon home with the commander and we have an ol problem actually we have many problems let's go discuss yeah we have a lot of baggage in the main keep one of the upper floor offices has been converted into a meeting room that the page leads you to where Ansem Petra several of the other new newly minted royal guards who are wearing kind of these blue sea green cloaks with gold trim are all speaking and seated at the head of the table is Leonor she has found a rather striking dark purple gown that she is now wearing that complements the porcelain mask that she wears over her face and it has this very wide brimmed purple hat that she's wearing on top where these clothes came from but she rocks it lady you look amazing thank you veil she says behind the porcelain mask the Lord Commander is at her side and he has a bunch of papers in front of her it seems like as you came into the room he was trying to tell her what's happened over the past 15 years and even though you can't see the expression on her face seems like she might be terribly bored by the whole thing as you come into the room the Lord Commander turns to you all and says show your proper honours for our queen I kneel your majesty and I bow and I say milady your majesty and I do a deeper bow sebastian thank you she says i plank i plank on the ground the Lord Commander has done a very good job of trying to explain to me the situation of our city but I must say the haze in my mind makes it difficult to really fully understand the gravity of what's gone on nevertheless I thank you 3 and I thank you Lord Commander it seems that there have been some disagreements but you've all had the interests of the city at heart I worry it seems that the doctor fled and the Lord Commander tells me he is not to be trusted but he was treating me and he has brought clarity to my mind I want you to know that that despite any misgivings you might have had with that man he did what you asked him to do my queen if I may say he may have given clarity to your mind but he actually was using you for his own his own terrible deeds to try to experiment on you of that I have no doubt when you find him I want him taken alive so that I may issue the stay of execution the sentence of execution myself gonna change my to-do list your murder oscar's now okay I can work the Lord Commander speaks and says our Queen may need continued treatment the first question is do we ask the silver order for help yes we did already tell them that we have the Queen so that's not a secret and we did already suggest bringing the healers in to look at the Queen so that's that has been laid out so it seems like a valid option Lenore speaks up I don't recall asking for your opinion on the matter Lord Commander nor do I ever think I need the opinion of you three with respect I would like to see the flame keeper hmm as you wish milady apologies milady I beg pardon madam the Lord Commander says yes I have a question if the flame keepers cannot do what you wish them we have a secondary option to go with we do we do potentially the amethyst Academy might I see you but I don't know what your opinion is of them milady they're strange and they often want much in the way of money for their services money that I suspect we do not have access to right now through the Treasury the Lord Commander shakes his head no this is a shame they were a good resource years ago when you we could be count on being able to afford their sight I would like very much if they would be willing to find out where my children are something I think we can look into potentially but I'd like to keep them as a backup just in case these flame keepers don't I'd like to have a plan B because I think your health is of the utmost importance indeed I am to understand that you are planning some sort of military engagement Lord Commander to retake the outer reaches of the city and you three plan to be involved in this yeah we're gonna help we're probably the crux of it all but yeah well brick I will leave matters of security and military to you and the Lord Commander you Pluto Jackson we have a matter of state to discuss when your meeting with the Lord Commander is complete please see me privately yes your majesty with Pluto privately that is correct he is a prince of caspia is he not yes then we will convene only as heads of state and their representatives may guys it's just it's like I'll probably like get a ceremonial dagger I will probably write some some signatures on a piece of paper you know like like political stuff it's boring I'm not what no one for politics but that what business no it I can't really ask the Queen that that's her she's not gonna answer me okay Your Majesty I think coming us together as a group we should know what our next plans of action are together no no they oh I will confer with Pluto Jackson privately as you wish in the meantime do you have any of my flowers I think we gave Oscar they're all gone at this point but we can get more you could get more one of those crystals that I have heard about they're very pretty I'd like a few we can find some for you know what delirious well we don't have any now but it is hard to come by but we'll do our best I think we can work on the flowers we need somewhere for the flowers yes wait you know the crystals were so beautiful I must say they sing don't they I can hear them it's like a little chorus all across the city they kind of do yeah it's very sight drank a bunch of it yeah they do but when I drink one of the potions I hear singing they also turn rats mutant and monsters and apparently humans are so I would caution you my lady based on our experience with them yeah we just be cautious because they can do more harm than good I know my self and my own caution and I thank you for your counsel avail me I would like to have some of the flowers and crystals please the sooner you can bring some to me the better we will put it on our checklist right at the top you may discuss your matters with the Lord Commander and I will see you shortly Prince Jackson yes my lady thank you I bow again well that she stands up and leaves hey whit taking a gait that almost seems to float as she leaves the room so poised so beautiful she leaves the room the Lord Commander says I'm glad to have her but she's going to complicate things greatly commander we can't give her any delirium crystals that's that's a no-go how can we lie to her other crystals she knows was it if we bring her delirium the last time we gave it to her it sank into her hand and then her eyes started glowing again yep but she has the cool visor now and we didn't say that we we said we would try well do our best you have any of those flowers we know where they are they're in Queens Park hardly I think we got we ran out but good luck getting them back it's a bit nasty in there so she's making a lot of demands and I am very conscious of keeping up with him because if she gets angry and opens up that mask oh yeah but yay Queens back we have to understand that she fan the pissed cats needs to understand that she's still in a mind of yes functioning mind but she's still not herself and I think we still need to realize that as much as she demands as much as she is the queen we have to make sure that the safety of the city goes first and if she's busting out lasers out of her eyes that's not safe for anyone I think we children yes I would say that would be a primary and it's a goal that she gave us it's this yeah technically that takes precedence over flowers and crystals give us that first and the flowers might buy some time I feel like they're less dangerous maybe we've gone through Oscar urines lab and it does seem like he has a few more of the left behind a few more of these doses of whatever he was giving the Queen should we continue giving her this or not no yes yeah I think so what do you think I think that remember what he said he was trying to turn her into something and I think those doses were changing her he was keeping her head clear though but that's why we want to get the falling the flame keepers and to assess the situation I think first before giving her what if her situation gets worse because she doesn't have the medicine in the time being what if we all I could recall was that he Oscar urine said that she needed these doses daily so if we stop if we stop this whatever happens is gonna start happening again listen I think if if you see her getting worse then maybe give her one of those because at least it keeps her somewhat her size the half dose we're meeting at the silver ordered in two days maybe half doses until we can find a replacement for Oscar I feel like we don't have the knowledge to make that assessment so just can because I understand your concern Vail we also need to keep her alive and I'm worried about her going the other way if we don't give it to her that is true I mean I took some notes from Oscar's notes you go over those notes see if there's anything that you can figure out Sebastian delirium bad you can take the next couple days to figure it out it's fine that's literally all the notes I have a few more we should be conscious of giving her more I would say at this point in terms of not the serum that he's created but solarium crystals I would say goes too far and will morph her into something that she is not regardless of what she is now in light of this I'm considering inviting the silver order here directly to meet with us I think that makes sense rather than the mill she's safe and secure here this seems like a good meeting place yeah agreed having a few paladin's walking around too might not be the worst for morale no that would be terrible I can't invite too many of them here in the fortress the many of my men don't trust the silver order nothing but we're going to we're very quickly creating more problems for ourselves because of the Queen if we go ahead with assaulting temple gate our forces are going to be depleted by that attack even if it goes well we're going to lose people and then we're going to be stretched thin because we're going to need to hold here to protect the Queen where we're holding her in the keep and hold on to whatever ground we gain in the city even with the silver order there's less than 400 soldiers between the two between our two organizations defending whatever we hold is going to be really difficult yes we can strike deeply we can attack we can slay things we can get anywhere in the city but to hold ground in the city is another matter entirely because it in addition to all that we have people under our care we have non-combatants that stay here and they keep and help keep misil supplied we need to have supplies we need to find equipment we needed scavenge everything else we need to get messages out outside the city and see if we can garner some more support from the other nobles and just keeping security here with Leonor so do you have a solution in mind or something that we could take care of I have two problems that I'm worried about well three maybe four there's lists of problems we can't trust this over order but there are known quantity if the amethyst Academy wants to do anything we probably can't do anything about it but the Queen's men the followers of the falling fire they're unknown quantities and we don't know if the Queen's men know that Lenore is here with Oscar running around it wouldn't surprise me if that's where he went first I think we can assume that they probably know by now there is also the cell that I may or may not have unlocked during the kerfuffle with Oscar that apparently some Queen's men may have gotten out did they know was was no word was kept pretty tight-lipped as tightly as possible but I did and I want the risk that our enemies don't know we have to assume that they do this means the queen of thieves claims that she is the queen of Dragonite she's not going to stand for there to be a real queen I've worked as a bounty hunter for a long time is this what you're asking are you asking us to take out the queen of Thieves if I was the queen of Thieves I would be biding my time until our attack on temple gate and that's the moment that I would strike and try to kill the Queen who knows okay we don't know if she's going to if the queen of Thieves will try to kill an ore kidnapper he might not even go for that she might try to sabotage the entire operation on temple gate she could pull off any sort of distractions lure any sort of monsters yes a gang of thieves isn't gonna do much in a fight directly not against us but there's a lot of damage that they can do just by working in the shadows that's what I'm worried about we have two days before we meet with the paladins and then probably a couple more days to prep for the battle a temple gate during that time we could try to infiltrate the is this are you are you aiming more for infiltration and information or are you aiming for us to strike and try to take them down from within and cure the city of the Queen's men infiltration or as far as I'm concerned the three of you managed to infiltrate my barracks cause a bunch of chaos here in my own garrison and almost got out of this with Leonor in hand yeah we did and that's when we were being nice if there's anyone that's capable of causing chaos and someone else's organization it's you three and I'd rather see the three of you directed against Oh my enemies then back against me again that's totally fair that's what weekend I'm really sorry about Sten stop bringing it up I'm sorry people will forget it I don't know what you're going to be able to do about her but I leave it up to you to make sure that she doesn't get involved in our attack now what about the falling fire I don't know what to make of them to be honest I don't they seem like a bunch of normal folks following a bunch of gobbledygook to me so far they seem pretty passive they believe in Heroes that between the two of them oh yeah you guys do I can count on the Queen's men being up to something I don't know what to make of those folks at all so you would say the Queen's men are the priority I'm saying the Queen's men are definitely gonna be a problem for us okay other than that will benefit do we have avoiding is there any other reason why you'd want to wait for this battle unless you're growing fond of guard duty as much as I love hanging out with the Queen I think I'm more set for the field then the guardroom hmm adventure alright I'm going to extend an invitation to night captain Theodore Marshall and that flame keeper philia Reed to come to the barracks with their Elite Guard I'll push back the meeting by a day if you need it let me know how things are going we'll need time to prepare anyways if you're not back I'm going to let the flame keeper see the Queen I mean if we're not back that either means that something horrible has happened and we've caused a disaster or it means we're dead or we saved Dragonite or we've saved rocket time but you all know that you'll be part of that together hopefully you can how will we get a message back how would we get if we do send a messenger regardless of what form promise you won't kill them are they happy to send one of your pigeons maybe what if they know the safe word what's our city what's our we will whatever the messenger we send petunia will say petunia yes we will say petunia and we'll try to send some candied salmon with them in the midst of all this oscar you aren't still at large - the Queen wants him brought back alive what are your thoughts on that well hopefully he doesn't put up a fight then yep yeah it's really hard cuz he can teleport and stuff well this time I'm not going to be nice about it like last time I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt I thought we were gonna talk it out and then he kind of just poofed out of there next time we won't let him listen hmm I don't know exactly where the Queen's men and the queen of thieves are hiding in the city but I have a pretty good idea oh really that's helpful because we were just gonna go wandering for a few days well I heard that I used to command the city watch yes we do also have this map I don't know if that helps but it has some points marked we found it on one of the Queen's men maybe we can compare it to yours takes it says yeah that's a buckle down row that's where they've always been years things don't change meteor can strike this city and the thieves still come back so let me show you laughs a couple years ago a couple decades ago sold thief guy called Ryan pain comes out of the L survey laughter there's a whole war down there with a bunch of hobgoblins sets up shop here now used to be that the watch captains would go down to buckle down row and they break up the gangs every couple years someone would get into it but they kept finding a honeycomb of tunnels under the sewers and every couple years we'd go down break up the gangs and break up whatever we could find but they're like wasps if you don't get rid of a wasps nests properly the wasps they all just come right back and if the Queen wasp is still there then they're gonna there's gonna be more wasps so what I'm hearing is fire and I'm the insecticide oh yeah once in a while years and years ago aldrick von castles father gave the city watch the funds to pay the amethyst Academy to try to scry where they were hiding and they couldn't do it either amethyst Academy couldn't scry them we're gonna find them well who knows who might have paid the Academy off see imagine we can do it in the Academy couldn't put then rivers please let's go it's revenue raised there used to be our we the external times used to be that there used to be times used to be that there were well a bunch of old warehouses stables taverns and broken-down businesses round buckle down row that you might want to check out first we've been round there a few times mind you and the years since we come up with nothing but once in a while I sent some scouts down there and they don't come back and we've seen the gangs congregating around there since then so we know that's where the nest must be but where exactly it is this is getting some predatorial instinct in me really excited we gonna queens views hunting when the wasp killin wasp killing wasp killing that would say rat hunting but that would be disrespectful to the rats yeah these know they're wasps wasps and were the exterminators or the insecticide where's the fire we need cool lines to say when we yeah we're trying to we're just spitballing we want to sound confident and and intimidating like when we murder someone we need to have a cool line you say yeah it's important if there's any supplies that you need you need a couple potions we can spare a few ammunition maybe some more magic arrows for bayo if you haven't gotten on the holes but ok potions would be great just in case you know we we tend to over stretch our our time before we rest so we can do it in one switch swing we try to do it yeah I don't have any potions well I mean not of healing all right Oh Petra use go get go prepare the stock we'll see what we can spare for you thank you sir thank you you go talk to Queen I don't want to hear any of it okay I do I do Pluto guys it's honestly it's gonna be like she's probably just gonna ask me like about how things are in caspia because I gotta fill her in on 15 years I'm more surprised that it wasn't Vail like I know it wouldn't be me me and the queen of like nothing going on and they used to live in that castle it's true well yeah there I'm sure you can catch her up on dragon hime it's just a lot has changed in 15 years caspia is kind of like a shifting sands of of political turmoil when she was last in power before the meteor fell I was quite young and things have changed quite dramatically the wrestles of power failure do you want to go learn some magic how would be cool can how do you teach magic when it just comes to you I don't know I'm just gonna show you what a mage hand looks like and see if you can make one too that's how I figured it out I just went oh my hand there was another hand so try that hopefully I'm not too distracted about thinking about your meeting we'll get food I'll let you guys know what we will get food I'll show you some cool magic trick for lunch all righty with that I'm gonna let Pluto go have this meeting with Lenore yet tell us what you talked about after yeah you already friends don't keep secrets see you two later enjoy your food Denton Denton done I'm gonna head up as they walk away I head upstairs to okay Queen Lenore is a private chambers you head up aunt some standing guard and he lets you in there's another guard that's standing watch in the chamber and as you come in Lenore turns says little Jackson is that you yes my queen be idea God and leave us close the door tightly and then take off my helmet go over to her you'll forgive me Prince Jackson for the mask I mean but I am to understand it keeps others safe a necessary requirement I must say it's very good to see that things are the way they've always been in caspia the men out running errands and the women back home running the nation as it's always been my queen we we casts pians we have a duty to the to the to our people and we go out and we do we we do what we got to do how are your mother and sister doing they're great thank you for asking I recall your mother and I and we're playing quite the game of chess by post before all this happened I wonder if all the pieces of our old game are still on the board my hope is is that we can pick up where we left off try to hit the ground running you must forgive me the haze of 15 years makes things very difficult to recall I'm also to understand that my nephew is here in the city yes Jupiter is a little bit of a headstrong young one if I recall correctly yes we still have our boyhood disagreements but he is a strong and capable fighter tell me your sister is still doing well yes eros she she lives she stays in caspia and you'll be happy to know that my nephew is doing well too your nephew I'm really proud we're proud uncle what's the young boy's name named him my George and is George of von castle or a Jackson von Castle milady we'll need to prove it won't we that is my hope my queen this is why I'm here really so you've come all this way hoping to find the proof we need to pick up where we left off it's true it's our only chance to stabilize dragon high yes rather unfortunate timing wasn't it my son Leonard and your sister really hit it off and it's a shame that they had to get things going before the marriage could be finished Eris was always a little how would you say spontaneous but what is what is the the love of two young romantics so young George then was born after the this whole thing happened yes I don't think he understands the gravity that's he no he know we've kept him slightly in the dark all of the documentation everything that my husband signed with his seal me as witness the seals of your mother and father all of it is kept in the vaughn castle vaults in the cathedral of st. fort rubio i was trying to make my way there and I got distracted and I had a bit of a rat problem you've met my new comrades they don't know but they can help me get there and once you have this what about the Queen Mother yourself the the rule of Drakon Heim falls to you milady mmm and eventually if we don't find my son or my daughter's a tragedy it will pass to your nephew young George and if the cat and if your family can secure control in caspia then we have a mighty empire a new dawn the meteor is just a hiccup in the greater scheme of things this city is a beautiful place now different than it was before I have heard the Lord Commander say this is a cursed city but I have trouble believing that it's like a and the bones and the structure the foundation is strong we just need to do a little cleaning up that's all and with the help of these hooded lanterns the paladin's if we can drive the monsters out and take back the city we can establish a great and powerful alliance between dragon hime and cassia what was supposed to happen this has been a fifteen year long mission and it's this might be our last chance very true and very true we hope you're doing well enough to aid me in this I hope so myself too it would be very lovely if next time you see me please bring me some flowers I will try just like just like old times indeed well I'm very glad we could catch up over this it's good to see you I think you were only a boy when I saw you last little troublemaker indeed it's nice to see family and I I feel a very fish out of water in this city and so it's it is refreshing to see a familiar face well we will just have to see that you make are the one to bring that paperwork back instead of your instead of my my nephew because indeed I could very much see it that if any of my daughters are still alive maybe I could marry them off to Jupiter Jones and he could be next in line instead I believe we can make the original Accord work and I will show you that later Jackson isn't afraid to go into the depths of the city to find what is rightfully ours and to return it certainly we'll see you soon thank you thank you and with that what next shall we go get the other two yeah yeah yeah they've been they've been edited looped long enough really great meal good food in the cafeteria there's friendly cooks so I cast me H and did you like it it was cool but I still I'm not very good at it try no that's how I was eating it was delicious but I'm now curious rubbing crumbs off my face so what did you learn from the Queen so I have to be honest with you guys she needs us to get into the Cathedral yeah have to do with our kids yeah yeah then that's our number one mission yeah you have it's yeah it's yeah she didn't want to be too secretive about it but I think she wants to keep the Lord Commander kind of in the in the dark on this one why why us as well though it's because she has limited trust with certain members that are not in a distinguished place I have yes I have it's you see my ears go down and I'm just like it's not to say that you guys this is strictly a political mishmash it's all about you know like courts and wearing ceremonies and robes and stuff you get your dagger no but what I do know is that there is really important documentation that could save Drakon time and it's in the cathedral and we have to get it that was always the goal yeah was we wanted to get into the cathedral first because we're looking is it like more than the last will I was thought what we're talking about that's pretty much but what's even scarier is that I think Jupiter Jones might be making a play for it first when I don't know so we have to decide whether or not the the Queen's meant the Queen's been or the will I think like I don't want to say that they're unequal but this is the most important thing no no and yeah we do have to kind of keep a lookout for her kids too because they could be important although I don't disagree with the commander's idea that having an enemy who might know Oscar urine has escaped and he used to have friends with the Queen's men so if he goes to them and tells them that the queen is here that's a really big threat so it's it is a tough decision I think what if I think the Queen's Minh is like alarmingly now because I think the gate needs to go well but I think we don't necessarily have to be part of the battle of the gate I think we need to get to the cathedral before everybody well we we told the hooded lanterns and the paladins when we first laid out the plans that we would be the strike team to go in secretly into the cathedral and kind of like clear that out while they draw the attention out of there and I think with the Queen being more on our side of getting that she will tell the Lord Commander that that's what we need to do do you think that's something we can manage I'm I'm also worried that if Jupiter Jones gets there first or finds one of her heirs Jupiter Jones doesn't have an army of paladins and hood at lanterns he has like a handful of men one of them is Islam it slows them down a little bit and what is he going to take on the Lord of the feast and an army of Noel's with just his little squad of men I don't I don't think so is there do we know where Jupiter is right now I don't know let's put up a big sign that says you know Jupiter we want to fight IRL in amberwood village and leave him hanging and yeah just like that we don't know where he is I think well also could maybe the maybe some of the scouts of the hooded lanterns could figure it out as well we could also try to play him again maybe we can use him to try to get to it faster yeah do you think we can use him with the the thieves maybe because even if we can keep the thieves distracted with something that might be enough to prevent them bothering us during the attack I think we need to know where he is first yeah I think that's number one priority because it's only a priority to get there if Jupiter Jones is going after it I could use the amethyst Academy to try to find ship here or we could easy amethyst Academy because we could say that he's really a disruption to it so if we can use some of their resources to distract Jupiter then we can go for the thieves then go for the Cathedral even while we're in the city messaging the commander that that's all we need to do I think the thieves we've got days before our meeting nothing's gonna happen with the Cathedral or at least us even getting close to the Cathedral until that battle is gonna happen I also think that without the battle Jupiter doesn't stand a chance against the Lord of the feast and he's hanging out in that Cathedral we've already seen how he takes on trolls nothing compared to Pluto so maybe we got a troll we could do like an infiltration on the queen of Thieves I was thinking first thought was one of us like pretend to be captured we just get really deep in there and then we set off because if you want to kill a wasp nests like they think he's growing back but how concerned are we with the fact that the Queen wants Oscar alive I mean not too concerned I mean if he dies the only thing I worry about is maybe her changing her mind to help get more delirium he was helping her with that oh yeah also I kind of want to bring her flowers Queens Park Garden she it's just to buy some time maybe number one mission find her kids if it happens to go by queen Park out say yes I know she wants her kids but did we give her some delirium powder to like tide her over yeah like her kids are important but she's the current ruler and caspia would recognize it we just need to find this documentation okay so when are we gonna fit the flowers into this because that's that's the opposite direction it's just that we should just keep it in the back of our head next time we're bringing the Queen she's gonna 100% ask for flowers delirium or both and we need one of those to give did she specify exactly which flowers she wants or did she just she wanting me more of those flowers she wants she wants the special Elise did she say that she I'm just trying to say like can we bring her you don't want to seem incompetent yes that's a great way of putting it and come we know a middle name you know we know what she wants she's been feeding those flowers now where is in terms of on the map where's yeah where is the buckle buckle down row buckle down row down wait who's that on the map cool let's take a look together pull up the map okay it's real being strategic about locations if we're already close to the cathedral we could not be in the battle so as you know looking at looking at our map point 11 is the cathedral of saint rich rubio it's in the center of a large monastery complex in the in the temple ward of the city and temple gate is at 0.4 on on the map and that entire area the whole temple ward is strongly in control of the vicious packs of nulls so what you do know from this is that the silver orders goal is to take the cathedral as well and to this end given the number of nulls in that area that's why they want to attack in a large group some discussion has been floated that perhaps the attack on temple gate might draw away enough Knolls that you could possibly slip into the cathedral as well it's going to depend on whether your ultimate objective is to capture the cathedral or simply get in and get what you're looking for so what your approach will be is going to be up to you to decide now the shackle down row our sorry buckle down row shackle buckle buckle down row is off champions way outside the city walls yeah yeah it's outside the city walls proper so kind of heading towards amberwood yep in the spokes or no in the spokes yeah yep so it's on the other side of town mm-hm do the sewers lead from the spokes into the city yes veil as as you can somewhat recall much like in the sprawl there are parts of the sewers that lis lead in but there were always rumors back in the day that there were smugglers tunnels going from the spokes into the southward because that's predominantly or most of the the various criminal organizations operated it up in the heyday of Dragan Haim and those smugglers tunnels were how they got past the gate taxes and brought in contraband so if the Queen's men are operating in that area that would explain how they're able to get into the city makes sense so if we can take out the thieves at least we have another way into the city it could provide yeah especially on that south in because it's gonna be careful the crater we've never been that close to the crater before nope nope I think that we should move outside the city if we're going over there yeah definitely go visit um sticks sticks I have a great distraction for Jupiter market square Oh senator markets were not a distraction is that murder depends on if he tries to run away or so what is your what is your plan are are are you three thinking you want to because I I think I heard that you were floating the idea of even going right for the throat at the Cathedral or going and dealing with the Queen's men we could sneak in and go to the Cathedral or we could do it the Queen's men or we could go visit the cult of the fire there's gonna be a lot more action around the cathedral thinking about our sneaking abilities Bluto if we didn't bring some Knowles away I think that'll be more beneficial for us trying to sneak into the Cathedral so wait till the attack and then we can go yeah cuz Jupiter is not gonna be able to get in without that either yeah I think it'll be a race to the if we can infiltrate the hooded Lantern's then we can infiltrate the Queen's men I have more disguises up my sleeve yeah maybe as long as the Guinean of the cathedral is also priority during during the attack I think that's our main priority I said we can bail on the attack and go I think it's number one priority but in order to set events into motion in order for that to be successful I think we need to go to the thieves first okay I'm with you that makes sense yeah that sounds good I'm on more strategic planning okay so would you like to set out now or stay with the hooded lanterns a little while longer I say we go um after we get our ya potions and yes here okay a big THANK YOU

ammunition any other minor supplies that you might need for the journey ahead by the hooded lanterns and for you leave petra gives you from the hooded Lantern stores a potion of greater healing each and she says these aren't too much used to us because we haven't had a major for a few years and she produces some spell scrolls that the hooded Landers have been keeping one is a scroll of lightning bolt one is a scroll of greater invisibility and one and the the last one is a scroll of gaseous form we're going to need to write those down so that was Thunder ball lightning bolt lightning bolt greater invisibility or invisibility gaseous form awesome I think this ability one [Music] can you read scrolls okay okay I can do magic okay does that count if this spell is on your class spell list I'll probably not and you're a high enough level to cast a spell and yes otherwise you have to make a like if it's not on your spell list you have to make a check to use it or if you're not high enough level and it's on your list you have to make a check to use it I think so my list is probably all you knowing me with Scrolls those will come into play near the end of the campaign when I remember I have them you're like panicking in some last-minute busting oh yeah I have like nice girls read them all at once my bottle Scrolls I but I will try to make good use of them thank you I don't tell the commander these in the bag and they'll sink to the bottom and we'll come back to them yikes so with that Petra Ansem and the hooded lanterns bid you farewell and you are off into the ruins once again which route will you take and we're so you decided that you're going to head over to the spokes and investigate buckle down row in search of where the Queen's men keep their operation correct yeah so I think we should go around the outside yeah I think with it would be easier to do in the inside fit was closer but it's so far away like either way we're either cutting through the entire city or we're going around the outside around the outside is going to take longer but it's it's definitely like no Knowles yeah slaughter stone square you've also gone there pretty quickly and I can lead us on a pretty fresh we know the way like we're just basically going the same way we would go to amberwood village but then further yeah so as you travel the way I'm gonna have all of you roll me to d6 and tell me the higher of the two numbers you got five three four okay so remarkably it's not raining today is this the first time perhaps first time in a long time in fact the clouds are noticeably thinner than they've been in quite a while I'm freaked out and Humphrey as you pass through the city across the sprawl the embers of the silver orders battles with the Knowles in this part of the city have left the city as you head south eerily quiet and the streets bizarrely empty Drakken Heim has always been a ghost town but today it feels like one and not in the haunted ruins but in the abandoned like the outskirts of the city feel abandoned today whispies kind of go across yeah yeah it's like oh yeah especially with the light this much brighter it's just bizarre I feel like I can almost like hear more because I'm so used to there being like a pitter-patter of rain that when there isn't I'm like is this what a regular place is sound like when there's no noise it's too quiet and also way too bright yeah before long you cross temple road and emerge at Styx's ferry Styx the undead ferryman as always still there on his boat where you left him last time and paying the toll he rose you across the dran river to the spokes I've never paid the toll I just give him rocks every day every time I give him a little like like a pinch of my rations cuz you never know he might be hungry even asked him if he eats things IIIi did ask him did you yeah on the south side of Dragon high and make your way through the spokes towards buckle down row how are you going to approach from here buckle down rows sounds so inviting it actually sounds like a really nice place like it sounds very welcoming and warm so umm I don't know if I'm projecting a lot onto it but I walk right no no you walk right no I say we approach with confidence yeah I I feel like should we disguise ourselves if you like the best I could think of as they are you hiding off to the side and me and Sebastian during the old walk in because they all hate us and know us and have seen us and we've murdered some of them and some of them got away each time so they know who we are but the bandanas on just for like that three seconds where they're like wait are you uh oh wait no yeah let's do it I'm thinking that I have well they're kind of weird I'm even thinking if I have hide off in the shadows if I off in the shadows and I can always come in it's the wrong arm have it wrapped around my arm with a disguised self and pretend to be human veil I could be human veil how are you guys human veil is uh catches us me can human veil like if they start to see who you are I could come and be like there you guys are maybe that's our human stock right yes I don't know obviously you're nailing it huit yeah I mean I'm a half-elf so I don't talk I just oh my god like less intelligently I feel like that's out don't hurt just don't purr at all and I think you'll be fine I mean oh I said I love money [Laughter] I saw planets you in Vail but wait what if you guys need me to come in and act like a distraction as a thief I could cuz I can kind of change myself over I won't okay so if we are found out we'll be like oh we're actually captives and our copter is taking a leak and then you can walk out and be like glad you didn't run away on me so you're gonna use this guy self to disguise yourself as a human me if they get into trouble or because I don't want to just come in as maybe myself I'll gauge the situation they buckle down row is marked on the map that you recovered from the hooded lanterns or not the hooded lanterns the Queen's men that you slayed several weeks ago in this campaign and so sing it out through these can't you can see that there are several markings on it that you realize indicate the names of three taverns that used to be in this area one called the snake and Mongoose another called the slaughtered lamb and a third called the split skull well guys I think it's obvious that each of us goes to one of the bars that's it that's a good idea it worked for you before yeah yeah it can't not work twice I mean I'm not a hundred percent success rate on splitting the party so I feel like Pluto doesn't do well on his own you have a loss of instead I mean if you want to do that to the Queen's man that wouldn't be terrible yeah soft spot because he's goo [Laughter] but you get a little panicked I I don't like being alone so don't don't leave me don't leave we're in this together bad things yeah but I can like all opere I can always come in and be a distraction if we need to okay look uh snare changer I've got a bandana just so it stayed close before clothes before I quilt a bandana on and literally changed nothing else about myself but I do have a buzzed head are my eyes done glowing yeah they're yeah what about I wear a bandana will it help cuz I'm wearing like giant armor yeah put it around the armor just yo I'm a Queen's Minh see bandana they're not smart okay it's do it I'm gonna put on my band a I'm just making assumptions I yeah it probably won't work but I mean you from afar approach buckle down row you can see that there are it's now the afternoon and you can see here's some hoots and hollers in the distance and smell in the air a combination of sweat booze and desperation smells like my house oh wait don't they have the fighting pits close by remember the remember that's what the the old man said pulling fire guy did he he was like they have fighting pits what you notice Vale as you come into this area you can see and pollute Oh after a while you know certain us at to several of the second storey buildings in this area it's a district that is mostly workshops warehouses stables and broken-down businesses as a spillover of the industrial district that was in the South Ward of the city and many of the second storey buildings or warehouses you can see there cleverly disguised in the rubble rubble but there are very clear hidey-holes nests and kind of lookout spots that have been constructed it's like looking up at that window you can see that oh yeah someone's pulled some netting across the window so they can hide better making a sniper's nest or someone has added or that boarded over window across the street just has a perfect little arrow slit poking out of it you start to notice that there are clear signs that this whole area of buckle down row has been managed slightly that's why we're wearing a bit Deanna's oh they won't know if from far fit like if they're trying to snipe us they're gonna see purple bandanas and strangers mm-hmm aren't that fair you're staying in the I think I'm gonna get up on the rooftops we like looking at cyber nest and this is vo oh she's up there oh cool I'll kind of keep an eye out from up top but I'll try to stay behind the chimneys hmm but know that my eyes are on you thank you looking down buckle down row you can see it's a longer bullet longer kind of narrow Boulevard cobblestone street that weaves its way through the spokes and you can quite plainly see from the rooftops vo that there are people coming in and out of the three taverns that were marked on your map only after only a few minutes of observation the signs of them going and in fact outside one of the establishments there's a group of people that are drinking yelling and having what sounds like a good time in the afternoon there are people alive down here I didn't expect that sounds like a party hey ready to go party my name is Sebastian Crowe and I like to party it's a great great intro you told them that I'll come with you okay yeah start with would you like some Illyria nail to get your party started yes I hand you one of the bottles that I have I say oh oh we pretend to drink Oh strong stuff oh yeah carry with you yeah you can meander down the street with that and people won't even notice you deal I'll fit right in which bar should we head to the busy one when I see on the map is there any of the specific bars marked off on the map these there are other establishments a long buckle down row but these are the three that have been marked have been marked yeah okay um which one do we hear is the rowdiest hmm the most commotion commotion our gist of the three is the snake and Mongoose but it seems like the most there's some angry yells coming from the slaughtered lamb that's our that's our ticket anger equals party party anger that they might have them the drunkest do we flip a coin about it whatever sprinkles your doughnuts um I'm open for any it's over going right heads is which one sneaky Mongoose well tails is the other one heads okay that was easy stinky Mongoose snake and Mongoose so not the rowdier one but the busier one bigger one the largest one the largest one okay it's a good place to start you had done the row the snake and Mongoose is a large tavern built around a single huge stone chimney so that kind of rises up out of the center of the building and there's smoke coming from the chimney the building itself has a big set of double doors at the front of the establishment with some small steps leading up to it but there's a porch on the north and the south end of the building outside collected on the porch are some broken down tables and chairs and what look like a few sleeping mats as well and on the northern porch there seem to be about half a dozen gang members that are passing around a pipe and drinking from a bottle of what might be some kind of bootleg ale on the South porch you can uh smell what smells like someone cooking like a chili maybe and there are a few very daytime drunk looking members of the Queen's been passed out as well on the on the South portion whether they're just very sloppily sprawled over a pair of the benches there's two of them they're around the entrance there have been stacked up several barrels tables and chairs and bits of wire and some sharpened spears like all the entrances have been slightly defended in some way and there's a few of the Queen's men a very large burly dwarf and what you realize is Matt not a half-orc but a massive bug bear with a potbelly the two of them outside the front door and all of them are wearing the left arm thing yapple yep with the purple band with the row the red rose on it I at this point again go up on their top and say pork chops if you need me I'll be keeping watch I scurry up onto the closest roof behind a chimney okay what's her what's her uh we wrought up we're on a pub crawl yeah you can pretend to be drunk I can and then we'll walk up and we'll be we'll be sharing it back and forth but like not really drinking it oh I mean I just think a little bit yeah I took a swig okay well you're a bottle can't be full when I walk out no I know I can't but you could also port on the ground that would be a waste you okay you know what you sound like someone that needs to are we just walking up and okay let we'll go to the people in the north and see if we can get some the yeah no you know see how they're doing all right I'm ready I run it I approach the north patio the people drinking and smoking okay there's a group of gang members here some of them are wearing the Queen's men bandanas others look like they might not be wearing a bandanna or or just some of them have kind of let themselves a bit loose there's two halflings that are very interested in each other I have one side of the porch keeping to themselves there's another group of them three more humans that are passing around the pipe and a shaved headed dwarf woman with who seems to be hogging most of the booze and as you approach one of the the the human men is saying hey Lassie give us some of that grog then I and she reluctantly passes him the beer and he swings it back and she snatches it back cuz you'll never leave enough for me hello you guys ever tried a leer in one I'm gonna grab the bottle edit your hand on the bottle and uh I'm gonna kind of toss it to one of the guys this will put some hair on your chest cool you two can both make a deception check no it's gotta it's got the loose cog cork 2115 okay the man catches it so where'd you get this piss obviously Illyria says so on the bottle he takes a swig of it oh it's not bad that's my third bottle today which outfit you boys with the outfit sorry I've had a lot coming in for more or playing a game or what I'm I'm just here to hang out yeah we're gonna play some games what games are we playing today yet dice we got cards they're all inside I'm proficient in cards where's the cards table at I'm sorry what was your name that's rude of me I'm Mac Mac he goes around introduces the the rest of the the the rest of the thieves that are with him and they all just kind of as you as you approach who are you with again I'm with my friend here he's we're just here to drink come on let's get you inside yeah let's I'm sorry I'm gonna push them all I need more so I can play cards have a good night gentle men greens you you - he - all right now that step in to the bar you come out and rate as you come in in in the door there is right beside you a large l-shaped bar kind of curved on the one corner with several stools loaded up around it and then right across from it on the other side of the room there's another bar so there's two both in the corners of the bar there's a large earth fireplace and you can kind of see on the fireplace in the center that the other side of it is another fireplace that's in like what would be the kitchen and opposite the bars or the set of double doors the main entrance a set of stairs leading upwards and what looks like a makeshift stage which has just been covered over with a few more tables and chairs the place is packed there could be at least two dozen maybe more people in here all of them drinking shouting eating playing cards gambling and dice you can see very clearly that that each of the tables have been all organized around a specific game of some kind as if they set this up as an impromptu casino there's two doors leading into interior rooms one that you can tell probably leads to a kitchen of some kind another perhaps to a storeroom as I walk in I listened at the yelling and shouting I did it's like a small chance of this but does anybody happen to mention offhand a what was the question that yes which which unit are you with or which yeah looking for like identifying markers does anyone have any badges that go beyond there there does anybody say anything like are you skull boys there's nothing on us as you scan the room make a perception check Bluto 18 there's a few individuals here that you can see that are keeping themselves to the sides they're very clearly not drinking and they all have their hands on their weapons you count them four maybe five you're ready to play some cards yes where's the cards table there's a few of them or they're playing and three-card ante and a few other other games few people are screaming over the money that they've lost piling the coins out the coins and you can see that not only of a pipe they betting with coins a few of them have pieces of delirium that they're betting with some of them are betting with bottles of booze and other things that they found in the ruins some of them are even exchanging notes with

trouble there and I get pulled away by Pluto and we're gonna head towards the the downstairs the back door okay I seeing this like I can't let them go into trouble without me and I cast the skies self to look human what does human veil look like human veil has she's weird cuz regular ears black spiky hair almost like it just hasn't it's got its own gel that kind of spikes it up scrawny but a little bit shorter not quite you know like dwarf size but definitely shorter than she is and she's got a scar that goes across try to make her look a bit tough and I vo ties the the bandana around her arm to make her look like a thief she looks pretty scabby in her outfit that's a bit more dark than she normally wears like normally Baio has a little bit more like brown leather but nope she looks like a bum from the street more about Mary she normally does and I'm gonna go around to the front doors and burst them open say recruits where do you think you're going a it's some lady yelling at us we've been found out anybody got any pork chops I have some pork chops and she witness this lady is freaking me out Pluto why she says pork why she what she's walking towards us what do we do just say go into the fights without your manager leading you what's your name Bella Thanks I'm obviously your human manager Bella it's about time you showed up yeah it pluto's about to go into a fight you got to manage him and I gotta Harold him these newbie thief's think they could just go in the ring without their manager get in there now that I'm here go I'm a big wink again does anyone is anyone paying attention to us some people are but there's more looks of when they realize what you're talking about there's a general commotion in the room and they're like so and one of the thieves turns to ounces yes we gonna go down and fight yeah well who's gonna fight I'm gonna just introduce them and she's gonna manage him my recruits gonna fight eh yeah we're putting all of our money on seems a little boring we like to see a little bit of a battle royale down here oh it was boring I'm not a scrappy sort of fella I'm pretty scrawny and I've had way too much wine if you're just spoiling for the 101 the one-on-ones then you bet you might want to head over to the skull and sword down here we do it three versus three versus three versus three a question is magic allowed winner-take-all I mean do we go downstairs I guess is your manager Hertz I should probably lead the charge Thank You manager mrs. manager fella that's right what was your name again I think you just straight-up call me pull it up no no that was that was the wine is the line again it's a wine thing my name is d'Artagnan he hasn't quite come up with his thief's name yet you know it's Deb my thief's name is yeah Deb and I'm knife-cut Pete there a better thief name right you three man I wish I'd never come back Jack now Deb and I run the fights down here you understand how this all works you knife him in the gut anyway I'm some goal if Deb um here's the deal down here we fight for real you want a fight you can give up if you're lucky but you don't have to hold back nothing if you don't want to everyone that goes into this well you put down what you want and you walk away with everything everyone else puts down deal well what's his name blackjack mill blackjack Mel blackjack Mel yeah that sounds fair you gotta be able to put down at least 25 gold each if you want to enter guys it's just once so much gold from that whole table I glanced back at the angry bugbear mmhmm yeah 25 gold I have it but it could be spent on food if you win you get the pot plus I share the bets if you lose you might die cool we never lose weight I think so give me one second to talk to our champion and our manager what's in this for us like it what are we we're trying to figure out a way into the Queen's men's hideout should we just like make buddies with them if we win no that's it if we win don't you to see the Queen no then maybe they'll like be like let's all go back to the hideout gang and we'll be like yeah and we'll just walk with them home is there any chance that they know who we are and they're just gonna try to trap us and try to murder us potentially that's a potential but I think I think that we are so good at disguises right now and nobody suspects a thing yeah you guys didn't even suspect that I was me fellas yeah that's your really good veil thank you fella Bella and Ella Deb a knife cut piece yeah yeah babe all right yeah we're in Deb's all right you're in a they take you downstairs down a set of dank stairs into the basement of the snake and Mongoose we're what might have once been a large undercroft of some kind has been filled with sand and converted into a fighting pit and there are several it's a big round room that's all supported up top they fill the whole room with sandal along the bottom there's bits of bone and blood all in the sand and then there's just a gaggle of makeshift bleachers all around the room you come down the stairs it looks like there's like a storeroom off to and they they bring you through what was kind of a concealed door in the storeroom to get down in here and as you come down a bunch of the other gang members from up top also start coming down as well and in the in here as you enter the room you can see that there's already been fights here this morning of various groups of them they're kind of dragging off some guy's corpse as you as you enter the room and there's another exit off the whole fighting pit where they dragged the corpse and you just hear like this throwing sound and a splash and debris the smell of sewage briefly fills the room before they shut the door that's why the bodies go fish people get to follow the bodies because I have a fish people we could also like this could be our way back in here you know if we ever wanted to go through the corpse hole there is one other exit in this room it's a closed door where it leads to don't know so there's the stairs in there's two other exits the one that seems to be where they're throwing the corpses mmm-hmm keep that in mind we have a couple ways out in case things get squirrely there is a set of cheering as you come down and blackjack male speaks up all right you lot I've got three more for the slaughter who's up next I think we've got enough now to do another match by the way guys I have an hour until I turned back into a cat so let's make this let's kill him quick times okay Jeff Jeff okay let's get ready to fight so he blackjack Mel comes into the center of the room and now a bunch of the others from up top have filtered down into the fighting pit they're all taking up positions on stools and benches and barrels all surrounding the room and there is a small senile looking gnome with a piece of chalk that's writing that's starting to write like a scoreboard on one of the walls and blackjack Mel speaks up and says all right here's the rules 12 we're gonna go in three to four teams of three for those of you that get that count count ask one of your buddies I know a lot of you have trouble counting as far as three and you they're two fingered Pete I'm very sorry that you it's all right Pete hi Pete I'm draw in the sand I'm what a knife cut Pete I don't know I don't know my name we just call you knife cut knife alrighty so here's who we got who are you three what's your names I'm Deb knife got Pete Bella we're gonna call you the fresh meat Oh sounds delicious yeah that's what I eat for dinner he writes fresh meat up on the top it's like alright who's in for fresh meat and some people bring like start putting their bets we're gonna put the odds here at four to one I'm trying to like get like I'm like going up to the crowd like and then he Harold I kick some stepping out of one of them one of the room is a bugbear a Hobgoblin and a goblin all right you three are gonna be the Greenies set the odds at two to one and people start betting and the the bugbear the Hobgoblin are all pumping themselves up the bugbear is wearing leather armor carrying a big club the Hobgoblin has a chainmail armor a sword and shield and the Goblin has a small bow then he then three dwarves step forward all of them women and all of them have braids and hammers and he says we'll call you through the short stacks writes them down know bad about killing me we're gonna put the odds of five to one are we just gonna murder her these people are gonna murder nine and then finally there are three human three human bandits that step up and there one of them is carrying a shield another has a orange mohawk and the third has a pair of razor-sharp daggers and they say were the razors yeah and blackjack Mel just nods like all right whatever not impressed with their intro well set the odds at two to one we have and then there's a bunch of people that are arguing like those odds are don't add up and people are like this is unfair and there's a general commotion as all the the the patrons argue over blackjack Mel's really oddly set odds that he's been laying down for the bets and they go over several times trying to decide exactly how to set all the odds and eventually agree on them and many bats start to get placed as well okay here's the plan I'm gonna put ten gold on us do we already have 25 gold ijen right I'm not gonna put any more put more that means you want no I'm good I'm good my 25 so who we fighting first it's a free-for-all what yeah we got ass last last team with at least one person standings the winners so guys I'll I'll stand in the front you guys shoot everything over top of me I never should put me up and we do it one at a time as things come I'm only rule whatever you can't hurt the crowd but the crowd can hurt you if they want to I mean yeah totally acceptable in regular can you leave the what if you get knocked out of the ring there's no ring to get knocked out of that makes sense no we made now rush me if you're too worried that you're gonna die all you need to do is put your hands on your head and start screaming in a high-pitched voice I surrender I surrender I'm a brave little I'm not a I am a cowardly little wiener okay and then that might let you live yeah maybe that's his battle cry okay I won't I'll say it once and then I won't say it ever again I think we're ready yeah I'm not afraid I am free he may be the fresh meat but you never asked her how she got her scar and this guy I've seen him kill a troll with his bare hands what have you lot done there nailed it intimidated oh nice yeah nice we should kill the bugbear first we should kill we should find whoever is the biggest guy and kill him and then just work our way down I've never really been in a plan right a free-for-all with other people that I'd usually I murder people who have done wrong like are these all Queen's men yeah we all starting in different corners yeah it's a round room but they all say close the door to upstairs yes I throw something through the corpse I said there was two levels no there isn't the the room itself is only about 60 feet wide okay and everybody's sitting around the outside edges of the room watching the fight in the middle so there's like a ring of about 30 people watching this whole fight go down in this really cramped quarter what does the ceiling look like ceiling vaults up and curves it's it only reaches a height of about 20 not 20 px probably more like 12 feet that's a made out of stone hmm did you get more of the vile did you get more than goob yeah I got a fight so I'm gonna blast these guys or spells right yeah what if I hit some of the audience then that's probably in a union trouble so what if I hypnotic pattern the audience that doesn't hurt them no okay how about darkness hmm okay oh where are the lights coming from in here there are several torches along the sides of the room I'm worried I'm loved okay blackjack mill gets everybody out in the sides of the room she pulls up his coat slicks back his greasy hair says all right you lot remember don't go easy on each other and that goes for all you all as well pointing at the at the spectators y'all ready sure roll for initiative does he say that oh goodness that's that's not giving well with advantage I rolled the one and A two guys were we're going last the 19th okay me and Pluto are too busy like trying to pump each other up we don't realize that the like I'm giving you an impromptu back room and it I didn't realize the fight started I need I need I need like some positive vibes man and you're like okay I'm gonna do one initiative count for each of the entire team the other teams but you guys will all have your own what do we got 19 4 3 so it's gonna be fail everyone sorry Pluto got the three yeah Sebastian okay so Vail will go first then the razor's then the Greenies then the short stacks then Sebastian and Pluto I like to bring up the rear okay Vail what are you gonna do oh sorry go ahead I immediately take out my bow a name for the book bear that seems appropriate well I got taken out the big guy first kid I mean obviously the second-biggest guy some biggest guy okay I'm Deb um and I'm gonna use my my dread ambusher to give me my additional weapon attack I'm gonna use my bonus action to cast Zephyr strike okay let's set a new record let's see that bugbear survived a viola Bella is the zag 17:17 to hit yes okay let's see the bug bear tries to raise his shield to block the strike but it goes right past it it's it's a hit Oh d8 is regular d8 for a zephyr strike d8 for dread ambusher and a d6 because I can advantage on my sneak attack and just for all y'all wondering the I did not know what to expect from these three tonight so I have no map prepared so we're doing theater of the mind 40 damage Oh 4-0 leaves him bloodied but he is still alive you got another attack good well don't stop won't stop 20 that hits that's funny it's so funny 17 damage okay sorry 25 damage so that for those of you keeping track at home that was 85 damage Colonel I'm sorry 80 82 damage total leaving this guy at negative 17 so what happens um I get him in the chest oh the Boromir I get him yeah early it's like it's going up and eventually I ended right between his eyes yes neck eyes so this massive bug bear the biggest guy in the ring just gets shot three times right off the cuff and goes down with a large thump and he falls forward on the arrows and they all shoot at the back and the crowd just goes crazy cheering and I start screaming like I do like it like a roar we like to think we already won we're like I'm like okay that's how I give other people scars I think that's more than a scar [Laughter] I feel so powerful now and like come at me you guys got nothing Wow make us targets that was gross I'm so confident now I'm just like yelling and chirping all of them seeing this the razors are shocked and the three of them immediately - towards your group aggressively the further the first one dashing forward using their cunning action to close the gap - towards Vail and as he does so the others take their takeout knives and the first guy it's almost happening like simultaneously he goes in low to slash achieve a Oh getting a tender hit and a nine to hit nope I jump and as you jump backwards his other two teammates take out their knives and a whistle of four daggers or sent flying towards you Oh getting a 19 yes a 17 yes in 9 and a 6 to hit so to hit two days and they almost push you back perfectly and they land their sneak attacks getting a grand total of so the first attacked is 16 damage and the second is 12 as you throw their whistling daggers out towards you the two of them that through through their knives taking taking point at the center of the ring the other rate up against you with that we go to the Greenies who's seeing the biggest one amongst them go down do they do they break their nerve no they don't they're furious Oh the Goblin and the and the Hobgoblin and the Hobgoblin cries out oh you and he also rushes towards Vale but he can't quite close the distance so he throws his javelin at getting a 12 to hit okay and the Goblin shoots at you getting a 12 and an 8 to hit nope this is going well for us feel like I'm in the middle yeah you dodging and taking all the a lot of friends meanwhile though the the short stacks charge towards the men in the center of the room and all three of them just batter their attacks on one of the guys that threw the daggers at veo and they bake clobber him to the ground and end up the two of them swing their hammers around crash his head in from the side and cave it in and he falls over dead gross we can now go to Sebastian so how many people are no they're not based with veo they were throwing stuff at her but all of the enemies are like in front of Vale right no the bugbear he's in the center of the room well he's done he sorry the bog where is very dead the dwarf the Dwarven women with their hammers and their braids are in the center of the room clobbering the two men the men that were in the middle as well there's one of the two men as raid up I got up against veo the goblins where he started and the Hobgoblin is charging towards you all as well I move up to veo and I look at her and I'm like cover your eyes it's about to get weird and my eyes turn black and this like oozing darkness a roughs from my body in a group of snakes that start to coalesce in the air and form this hypnotic pattern and the group in the middle the dwarves and the other the razor's I'm gonna target all of them cool hypnotic pattern all the dwarfs fail they're saving throws and the razor gets a WoW they all fail they're all yeah buy it alright guys we can deal with that later I like my eyes return back to normal as the snakes get sucked back into me yeah cool Pluto you're up I run over to Baio and I just I just bring my my sword down right on on the back of this razor cool me first that's bugging you and I get a one no this was no I was hypnotized because one of them was right up to that yeah okay um so I miss yeah I just lands in the sand I bring it up and I swing again for a 19 that is a hit and I'm going to use maneuvering attack so I'm gonna do 14 damage okay and there if she wants she can move up to half her movement that leaves him bloodied and then I'm gonna use my bonus action did slam him into the ground with a 13 he falls prone I stand over him and I shift away kind of keeping everybody in the center to the side in order to make sure but I also want to make sure I'm not total back to the crowd kind of like shifting over a way so we're not melee but far enough away that I can use my long bow cool we go to top the round with Vale um I continue to use my long bow for two shots at I'm gonna go with the the rest of the Greenies team with left is a Hobgoblin and the Goblin I'm gonna go for the Hobgoblin cool six how's a Miss second shot 19 so the arrow crashes right through his shield uh-oh [Music] 24 damaged and penetrates his heart and he falls over dead the biggest guy was pretty much down on two shots Aguirre you did 17 damage I think I'm one of those hits right yeah yeah so like he you only took two arrows really yeah the third one is just for fun flare and when I look around do I see any openings in the crowd are they all really high they're pretty packed in why do you want to hide in the crowd no I was gonna see if I can get through to start to put out the lanterns or the torches but I will stand in the group covering my guys all of us back to back sounds good I'm standing over the razor next up I've got the razors so this this guy he clamors to his feet and he tries to go at you with his knives hi getting a 19 and a 13 to hit both miss Wow sorry bad JC's 20 now yeah it is nice so that you blocked both the attacks as he rises to his feet and tries to penetrate your defenses and just cannot the other is hypnotized and there's just a lonely goblin remaining in the Greenies and he says that's the appropriate response yeah yeah he gives up just I mean we won well they forfeit for being that team the crowd is start and start seeing starts crying out blood blood blood blood they're talking to us oh we're the blood they want us to draw the blood draw blood it's pictionary I usually don't murder unless it's necessary Who am I kidding I've killed like millions of Knolls I've shot what's his name with a warning shot that killed him I don't know well you're hurt there's others we can take out leave him for lost I'm standing on it like beside a guy I guess it's my my turn mm-hmm so still research right yeah who's there's the razor that's awake yep okay
