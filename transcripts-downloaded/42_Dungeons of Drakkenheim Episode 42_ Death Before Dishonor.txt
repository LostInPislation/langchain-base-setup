bathed in Elders fire Ahmed won't believe the tumultuous aftermath brought chaos families torn asunder in the kingdom shattered 15 years later monsters stalked the haunted streets of Drakon highway condom its rival factions struggling to rule the rubble three unlikely partners venture forth into the crumbling city in search of riches renown and revenge [Music] welcome back to the ruins of Dragan Heim when last we left our heroes they had solidified their position with the amethyst academy been showered with many rewards from the Academy as a result and had made their way back to the barracks at Shepherds gate to meet with the hooded lanterns there many pieces of news have changed hands between them not the least of which that it seems that by order of the hierarchy in the far-off city of lumen in Illyria an army will march on Drakon hime to arrive in a few weeks perhaps even a few months to assault the city in the name of the sacred fire what this bodes for our heroes as they tangle with both the followers of the falling fire the queen of Thieves the silver Order and the Academy it remains to be seen but our heroes have figured out their next objectives with the help of Jupiter Jones they have a lead on the net on another location for one of the old badges of the small Council of Drakon hime of which they now only have one again the staff of power of the Archmage which is a badge of office of the city that entrusted to the Sebastian Crowe by the ampere mission of the amethyst Academy so that they can work towards restoring the monarchy of West amar there is much uncertainty amongst the soldiers of the hooded lanterns at now having a group of Caspian xand formerly illyrians staying with them in the City Watch barracks but you know the commotion of the shift in allies there's some grumbling amongst the troops of AO but they understand that the situation is shifting on a dime these days it's definitely chaotic out there and you know my troops know that you know as the wind blows that's how things change Cass beans are still learning their footing as they come to Jack and I'm so be patient with them they learn slow but they are valiant warriors and they are to be trusted and it's so good that the amethyst Academy is in trust to be with this staff of power that represents one of the badges of Dragon hime because everything that the amethyst Academy is entrusted into my will has done well for us and not falling into wrong hands yeah you're totally gonna give it back right yes when I'm done with it I promise I'll return it when that may be unless they just need me to keep my position as a large mage of the amethyst Academy here in Drakon I'm in which case maybe I just hang on to it for a while but we'll see well I mean we'll see you know maybe will elect me as the Archmage see where things go I'd vote for you Thanks I'll go from you and I mean you're the you're the Lord Commander and you're your I'm here your your Pluto Jackson so yes gotta count for something I take my position turn right you know the muscle the muscle as you discuss the former Lord Commander now the lieutenant captain or the lieutenant commander Elias Drexel approaches your group in the in the barracks and he says I've got a few troops ready Scouts are coming back from the field reporting the various movements in the city I've had a lot of difficulty controlling things through the city streets not that we ever have had any control but we have word that there are many groups moving through the city streets now there have been sightings of both cavalry ranging out from the Silver order deep into the city there are skirmishes between the silver order and the the falling fire and we have seen more activity from what we can only assume are those in thrall to the queen of Thieves there's been more bandits there's been more looting more rating and even our scouts have run afoul of a few of their third groups there's a lot more rattling x' through the areas as well a few odd bands of knowles and some other monsters but as long as we move quickly through the city things are safer than they have been before the main roads particularly between here and the clock tower we keep that well patrolled that's where i've had most of the patrols going if we want to move towards the common house and see if we can find anything remaining in the lord mayor's offices we should have a good opportunity to head out there sounds good I think chaos is gonna get worse before it gets better in the city and I think if our men keep their eyes and ears open rather than getting into the battles I think it'll be better for our numbers absolutely Lord Commander if I may ask there's a few matters that we need to discuss to finalize our transferal of power if you will mm-hmm I would ask that myself and the Queen and you meet privately before we take on this mission all right I mean yes of course do my duty [Music] sorry guys jumping up and down like cheering me with all of us privately sounds good no just the Lord Commander thank you cool cool cool yeah yeah we know we'll be use yell if you need us pork chops if something happens shall we head up to your offices the Queen will meet us there let's go see her majesty do you want to you want to go get a drink yeah let's go get a drink and food I'll bring back some food Elias Drechsel heads up the stairs leading either way to where the Queens apartments and now your offices are yes have an office and an Simone Petra are outside the doors and they have a chest between them and the Lord Commander says to you first of all I took the liberty of contacting your friend's father Tobias Crowe is a skilled Smith and he helped us prepare this for you it's very thoughtful of you I appreciate that and Petra and Ansem open up the chest and there is a suit of glittering half plate armor fitted for you swaddled in a cloak and petra net and some pull up the cloak it's a green cloak with gold trim and on the back of it is a coat of arms and the Lord Commander says we all put our heads together to think about well you're a lord now you need a coat of arms I hope you like it and the coat of arms is two fish each shot through with two arrows on top of a shield best thing I could have asked for it I'm not crying you're crying the the Queen believes that we should arrange in a state for you but I think we're a little bit far off from such a thing don't worry about that in these times we're not really about holding you know states and manners and all that such just give me my clock tower and I'll be fine we have a few other important matters to discuss first of all your office requires an oath before the Queen as would many around the city and I would like to speak with you personally as he gestures for Ansem and Petra to leave your friends Sebastian and Pluto are brave but Polito is a Caspian Prince and Sebastian is now a member of the amethyst Academy their loyalty to Westham are and to Drakon hime is in conflict to a point it's heart they're our most powerful allies without a doubt but they could have a conflict of interest that worries me I just wanted you to know that I was worried about that thank you for being honest with me yeah you will take it into consideration when we're doing dealings with the others but I can tell you without a doubt they're first and foremost priorities are to help this city help it through the guise of the Academy and through caspia but to help the city nonetheless I understand I also am not convinced that you made the right choice in siding with the amethyst Academy I feel that our allies that we had in the silver order had earned a bond of blood for the work that they did with us in the field and I regret that we are now going to have to order our men to kill them I agree it was a it was a tough decision but those unwilling to compromise for the sake of Union are not having our best interests in mind and although we did go to battle with them battle is not the only thing that makes a new city I agree and they wanted to burn the city to the ground and they still do and I don't want that exactly at the same time I'm not entirely convinced the amethyst Academy has the best interest of Drakon diamond heart and I'm worried that they're going to try to influence the Queen you or our other allies in some way so that they can profit ear off the circumstances of the city I wouldn't be surprised by this either what they're looking for is delirium and unfortunately to get their help it's their strong help in getting any semblance of normalcy back to the city the delirium so we're gonna have to give them I understand him curse that rock it's brought us nothing but trouble but I think we are moving and Sebastian is really an ally on this moving towards understanding where it came from we actually have some ins with speaking to his his dead mother through magic and we're trying to get some information from that to understand maybe prevent something like this from happening in the future in our world if a good if it ever happened again that would be that'd be something else entirely there's one last thing a bit of a personal matter that I wanted to discuss with you just make sure that you're aware of this before you take your oath of office hmm I know for some time that you have the belief that your father is still alive that's a fine belief to hold on to we all need something worth fighting for and I'm not gonna question you on that as Lord Commander you are barred from possessing his seal oh okay well luckily I don't have it at this moment but I just wanted you to know that should we retreat it that the laws of Drakon haim and of the crown were such that none who possess one of the badges of office may hold another under their command mm-hmm okay I will be mindful of this when we when we retrieve it I'm I'm gonna put my feel and energy into making sure that we're gonna get them back I know that that object meant a lot to you and that you kept it safe for many years and if we do get it back I just thought that you should know before there was any confusion make sense thank you for letting me know I think as much as my father's badge means that much to me I think his memory holds more value to me than a an object and I think as long as it goes into the right hands somebody who values tracking him as much as he did I think that I should be okay with passing on that legacy to someone regardless we'll need the badges course it only we only require a few to access the secret tunnels that lead into Castle Dragon but we need all of them to exercise the power of the throne itself do you know more about this power that's a secret only kept by the royal family of course [Music] does the Queen know I don't know and if she does it's not my business to know I only know that the power of the throne brings with it command of the defences of the city and some other magical wards that are in place that could be useful to us should an assault come to our gates of course my worry is that if something happens to the Queen before then is there someone to pass on that knowledge to the new rightful ruler this is our key move that we need to play and that we need to hold the Academy to account we have those documents we have the phylacteries of the royal family yes we need to get them to act on that and see if they can find or locate one of the heirs we may and do have information about one of the heirs and we believe that he's on his way here actually George yes but we need to prove it and I think by getting the Academy to help us with this we can make sure that with all this madness going on with the paladin's that we are solidified in our union of knowing who is the rightful heir if he is indeed a rightful heir he's a boy but that will be what we need we will need to reclaim the badges bring him to the throne retake the castle and then we will be able to defend our sovereignty we'll be able to defend our nation so our our objective now is to get as much information about the badges we know the Queen has many if we have an heir if we have the badges of office if we restore the small council we will be able to rally the noble houses of Westham are they will come to our aid and they will bring their forces and we will be able to repel the illyrians especially with the aid of caspia you think that that alone will be enough to stop an army it will be enough to face an army and it might very well make the illyrians withdraw if Westham are can present a military power once again we haven't been able to do that for almost half a decade because of the civil wars yes we've been wounded but we're starting to we're starting to grow grow back and I think if we can get to that point then we can put up a front and at least hope that they're not willing to push further we need to think beyond Drakon hime now there are many objectives we can achieve here but solidifying our hold over the castle and the throne will allow us to pull in the resources that we so desperately need from outside for years I have been trying to get more support from the nobles but they believed it was a lost cause now we can show them that it's not are there still Nobles left in the city in Drakon hime no they're scattered very few nobles noble houses survived the destruction of the city but that's not all the nobles in Westham are yes the other great cities of Westham are the other noble houses effectively what was West amar is now a bunch of city-states the Dukes and barons all throughout the provinces excise their own power but they won't send resources to the city they've sent some men and materials over the years but that's been a trickle but if we show them that we've achieved our mission here they will support us ok the castle is key and we need to begin solidifying that ok I think it's a good plan to start and as we get news I think the scouts are going to be key and providing us information as things change just in case we need to adjust our strategy sounds good are you ready to take your own of course he leaves you into the office where the queen is waiting in her royal gowns and she holds out a book and a rod the book is one of the holy scripts of the sacred fire and she holds out her hand in one and the book and the other and you and he says place one hand on the Queen's hand the other on the text if you are ready to say the oath repeat after me I I vo Sonia feyo said you do solemnly swear do solemnly swear that I will defend the kingdom of west amar against all enemies I will defend the kingdom of west amar against all enemies that I will hold on swerving loyalty and allegiance to the throne I will hold unswerving legions and loyalty to the throne and that I will discharge the duties of Lord Commander that I am about to enter I will discharge the duties of Lord Commander which I've about to enter before the flame for the flame before the Queen for the Queen and upon my life upon my life it is done whoo put on your uniform wear it proudly well do so we'll get the others back in here the suit of armor is it is effectively a suit of mithril half plate so it is considered medium armor but because of its mithril property it won't give you any disadvantage on stealth checks search for something specific it's you should be able to find mithril hot plate in D&D beyond and the armor itself has has the mantle and the cloak attached to it it is and they've made for you the the image of the coat of arms is on the front of the art is engraved on the armor as well and on the and there and there's like the cloak is held in place by two pins that are made with a fish and a arrow Arirang that when they left so official looking I just missed most of the description so I'm just gonna pretend so veo has a new suit of armor it is a suit of mithril half plate that has been ordered through Tobias crow and as you went down you're introduced because River has brought your family to the barracks oh and Tobias Crow has been voluntold to work for the hooded lanterns oh he volunteered and he's prepared this armor for veo is a suit of mithril half plate that has her coat of arms upon it and beos official as as a lord veils coat of arms is a shield with two circling fish both impaled with arrows nice the armor and she's got pins that hold a cloak in place that are a little fish with an arrow and then on the back of her she has this green cloak that has the shield on the back of it and the the way that the the cloak is made is the shield on the back is quartered because two of the quarters have your personal coat of arms and the other two quarters have the coat of arms of the royal family on them as befits the the Lord Commander that you are able Europe you are allowed as a vassal of the Vaughn Castle family to wear both their coat of arms and yours beside each other speaking of we went and had drinks and food we brought you a fish young Wow look at snazzy though it's from shiny as if it's my coat of arms dead fish you know that looks great talk about yeah gossip Oh many important things I mean that's I'll tell you well we have the fireside chat okay cool well I'm a fireside chat good sounds good as you head down river pulls you aside Sebastian and says if you're interested in knowing what went down with Vale and the Lord Commander don't worry we're pretty much watching the Queen at all times now you should keep that in mind by the way the there are others in the silver order and in the falling fire that may be doing similar things you might want to keep private meetings and important discussions to the tower itself it is warded against such prying eyes okay fair enough well I'll keep that in mind well we'll try to move our Huddle's into the Academy tower that's it seems like a long way to go and we have to go through all that haze just to chat is there any way that we can ward other locations do you lock don't Oh Cass telepathic bond we'll just keep it in our mind that would be one way of carrying out your meetings beyond that if you know any spells like non detection the Academy could also fashion for you amulets that would reward you but again our resources are restricted in this regard for now if we're gonna have a meeting I'll do telepathic bond we can converse through that we also have a secret language we've been working on that's mostly shapes and yells we draw shapes and we yell at each other I'll just teach you thieves can't and they're not just that that whatever says the creature Matthias and others amongst the falling fire are powerful seers and they may be using their own forms of magic against us as well guys use your magic magic is so tricky right you know you can't talk with anybody without wondering is that the queen of Thieves it's lucretia Matthias hovering above us watching like I don't know it's alright I have a solution yeah yeah just not be secret about our plans and just tell them startup we're gonna punch them in the face you're right we will go work with the queen of Thieves and Lucretia Mathiason new wonderful dragon hime under their image yeah we're secretly plotting against everyone with that what is your next move well Lord Commander we do have Jupiter Jones and his mission was there any other mission that wasn't important first undertake the badges that's Jupiter Jones mission right yeah that's I mean the same mission we've had all along keep them on that track okay yeah back to the mission voices over people watching us oh yeah really bad just told you so keep on track on the badges and I'll tell you more later okay I feel like seeker people are watching us can I can I spend like if we are gonna discuss can I cast telepathic bond like take 10 minutes to yeah alright yeah ok ok boom so we're all telepathically bonding okay all right so Jupiter Jones Jupiter Jones so um the commander had a few things he was talking to me about ya know that kind of what I said a lot is that the badges are of most importance because if we can get them they're gonna help us defend the city better well maybe not better equally as magic bombs would well if I remember correctly the having more badges means we control the walls of dragon hood but the gargoyles we need all the badges all of them it's not clear the execution yet - cool conceivably yes so we need all the badges need all that so we know that Jupiter Jones is located one yes do we know if the location okay so we know that the queen of thieves has three as as you can kind of surmise and to kind of recap if you want to share this information with the rest from the throne of castle dragon the small council and the throne can control the defenses of the city so well someone that bears only a few of the badges can control things like the gargoyles and the executioner perhaps in proximity from the throne they can all be controlled simultaneously so if we have an arm if we have an army of paladin's I'm about to march on us if we can get the rest of the badges well that's what if get the rest of the badges take out the queen of Thieves to get her badges yes obtain all the badges and we need the throne so what we need the air we actually need the Academy to help us solidify who this air is to get support we have an air and he's on the way from caspia we have a supposed air have we magically figured out if he is there once he's here we can figure that out but I mean we have the paperwork and everything so we the factories we have the phylacteries so we can do some yes we need to do those as soon as possible as things start to come together do we still have the phylactery with yes those documents you did take they were in your bag of holding that you dumped out most important documents yeah you do you did bracelet doc is River still around yeah River is now stationed at the barracks so I can I quest her with like if I hand her George's phylactery to do any tests need to be done to prove there's various things that can be done but George doesn't have a phylactery right so we need to because he wasn't born yet yeah but when but with a blood sample and these phylacteries the Academy can use their magic to determine if he is a legitimate heir can I hand you a couple of the flock trees over to the Academy that through River that would be a Lord commanders decision because the the phylacteries could also be used to scry and try to find out if any of those heirs are alive how about hmm I don't know about that that's that's kind of iffy for me cuz you know the Academy has cried before I mean if you trust them then I am putting that trust no but like we could scry to locate the missing heirs okay I want to be there though or maybe we should be there when that happens potentially yeah yeah so maybe we'll keep the factories for now okay I think I trust you guys but I'm you're still the people I trust most good why wouldn't leave me alright yeah well you know trust and I stuff for you and I'm just hoping that I put my faith in a good place I think I did if we're all just standing in the hallway with our hands I like shifty eyes we're all just standing there going listen y'all yeah I trust you we've eaten together we've napped together I see you I see you put dragon hind before many of things and I hope that that continues they will hey hey we'll oh man she gets scared yeah as you head out and meet up with Jupiter Jones and the Lord Commander sees you off the Lord Commander says if you'd like to take any soldiers with you now is the time to decide I think for this mission based on what we discussed it's one of our most important pieces that we need so I think taking a few guys with us or girls how many would you like to bring things um a squad is typically six yeah one squad what everybody says so do you want to bring any of our veterans with you to lead that group I think to veterans and then four so you want to bring both Petra and I know okay Ansem will bring answer okay the rest you're gonna bring Ansem and then five others yes full squad okay all right hi Ansem so pay it's like when you're picking dodgeball teams you're just like I'll take handsome yeah Jupiter Jones says I heard that there were trolls living at the common house sounds like an easy enough fight but if you'd like me to bring some of my men as well we can make that quick work of them I'm all ears Jupiter Jones the more the merrier we got to get this done fast and we got to get this done right what do you think who do you want to bring I've got four good men you can bring along we'll leave them here both both me and Len at the same time I got either side of like you're standing behind me and he's standing behind you fritter Jones I bring in the big big brute - absolutely so you can compete with him yeah Brutus will come along yes Ernest yeah for so for the record the hooded lanterns have about a hundred and fifty soldiers but bringing more than a squadron yeah is a significant is committing significant resources you can do that if you want to it just the more people you bring with you out into the city if things go badly right bigger groups moving through through the city as well will attract more attention more stealth then what huh don't worry I drop my helmet and it makes like a loud like soldiers not like that okay so just to give you guys the the high level is as the Lord Commander says the the Lieutenant Commander says bringing our soldiers with you will give you a good advantage moving through the city streets because by moving in a large group it will dissuade lone monsters or groups of rattling Zoar any surviving knowles from attacking a large group the problem with this is that by moving in force with our factions we make ourselves a target to the Silver order the falling fire and potentially the Queen's men as well so well you will oh well moving with our soldiers will give us a larger presence that we could avoid the regular dangers of the city it invites more conflict and perhaps a counter strike from the other factions well then if if it offers any sort of help any cash means that will listen to me I tell them to listen to vayo that that's fine it as the drexel says home it's not about chain of command it's simply about recognizing the threats when we move in the city in a large group the other groups take notice okay how many do we have total six seven eight nine jupiter-like I think if for this squadron I think that's fine I don't think we need to work with too many more my hope is that the Caspian staying at home will help better defend while we pull resources away we'll just leave the Caspian on the walls and stuff yeah I I recognize yeah we have to be careful how many people we bring so okay so here's how this works if you are traveling with squadrons we're not gonna check for random encounters instead we're going to check for a Counter Strike I will be making a secret role to determine if moving with other factions has risen the notice of one of the other factions and because now you are openly enemies with both the silver order the falling fire and the Queen's men you're moving with the hooded lanterns and with this Academy or the Caspian soar the city could prompt to counter-strike from them and so anytime you guys do this could happen deal okay I mean what's the worst that could happen how long time wise would it take to travel to this area in the city only about an hour okay yep should we set out again as I said the advantage of bringing your troops with you is that it mitigates the danger of the city itself but invites the intervention of the other groups so if you if you wanted to you could say I want to travel with five squadrons of hooded lanterns but if you do that the chances of another faction intervening are basically guaranteed yeah I don't like this graduation from killing monsters to killing friends I mean and enemies friends ex-friends the last thing I said to the knight commander was I hope we stay friends and now he's waging war on track and I'm it's it's highly upsetting yeah it was really confusing one thing to keep in mind as much as they were our friends in battle they're choosing to be on that side to follow those orders every single person has a choice when they choose aside and they're choosing it well sad they can die if I make it die they're there they're setting their foot in in wrong territory and we have a right to defend our place well they better not end up on a sign the waiver laugh of power yeah also my natural Explorer is it negated because we're moving with such a big group or just certain pieces effectively yes yeah if you move with if you move with Caspian z-- they have no capability for self if you bring only hooded lanterns yeah they can move with self through the city it's not per se the stealth pieces as you remain alert to danger even when you're engaged in other activity that is fine that still works cool yeah awesome yeah Jupiter you know how to be stealthy right I know many things about stealth and the number one thing that I know about stealth is that it's completely unnecessary for a warrior as valiant and true as aye aye aye that's the spirit it's good to have some company here I really want to visit Casspi I bet it's a really loud place it's just constantly yeah there's just like horns and siren calls and like animals screams everybody like this everybody sound like you two like if I'm walking down the street Astor's just like fifty voices be like I would like some fish today sir alright excuse me I'm getting a lot of flashbacks too like when we were first you know way back when we were at the mill and I was like we should be stealthy clunk clunk clunk clunk glug glug and now there's basically a squadron of them walking I turned back to be fair no one can hear anyone when you're around us so yeah everyone gets like almost like advantage in stealth chicks when you're around us because we're just saying to you in your clunk yeah yeah I'm a good distraction interesting so you set out from the barracks with the Caspian group and so Jupiter Jones and Burtis and their men and ants and a group of other hooded lanterns making it towards the common the old common house the old common house was the seat of the magistrate in Drakon Jaime it was where the Alderman's council gathered the citizen elected city government of this of Drakon Heim and as you head forward to the the city and some says look commander we've tried a few times to shake out the trolls that are gathered around the common house there's a pretty sizable group of them but I think we should be able to take them out if we do the city archives are there including the old records of the sewer system ah yes that would be amazing I mean we have we brought the troll killers with us so I'm not too worried about the trolls but ooh sewer systems that would be a big help in exactly potential interprets what I'm eating secretly precisely there's also some maps of the city perhaps other municipal records are still left there seize all the old construction records could all be there secret passages okay okay you're really handy I wonder if the sewers I'm sure the sewers go to the the castle so we go kill a bunch of tree wouldn't surprise me if records pertaining of the castle weren't kept there oh yeah probably the royal family held their court at the castle this was a citizen's place but I mean the sewers were the responsibility of the city administration not the castle interesting all right badge city records okay forget this badge so sewer of trolls as you approach again you are traveling with the Caspian so I'm gonna have each of you roll mate to d6 good good I like to think me and Pluto are catching up on my sex some of our adventures five and two one and two okay you're welcome Thanks I don't know what's good anymore you head through the city streets of Drakon hime today the the city itself [Music] it's cold in the city only about ten degrees and the haze is thick restricting your visibility down the city streets too maybe no more than 300 feet as as always it is overcast in Drakon hime and raining and as you travel through the city streets along Shepherds way and then down Market Street through the Market Square and past the clock tower for if we pull up our map of drakon hime and just look up on here I might have marked it I might not have yet on the map just north of the clock tower there's a Plaza kind of where the Castle Road and the Kings Road intersect with from the road from the market to see where I mean there's kind of like an l-shaped building in there on the map that is where the old common house is yep and so as I said it's both the city archive the magistrates meeting hall and also a court of justice for crimes of the citizenry as you recall as you pass by the clock tower you get a nod from the hooded lanterns that are that are stationed there and one of them comes out comes out to you as you do so and they they flag you down as you pass the clock tower hello Lord Commander yes that is me we've uh we've got some reports there was a group of knights from the silver order that just that that have been in there have been sighted in the area they had it north towards the castle we think hmm towards the castle not Old Town they well both taking the this is Castle Road that you'd be heading up we don't know we we saw them move there were quite a few of them and three of them were on Griffin's when you say quite a few of them do you have an estimate estimated number about thirty thirty how many people do we have one of the other hooded lanterns terms there I think I saw the blue Griffin oh okay guys don't worry he is still our friend can I ask a question we could try to blow the scouts did they see any trolls near the city house we haven't skated up that way yet we've been trying to hold our position here we were worried when we first saw them that they were going to attack us but they moved on and they took the Castle Road out of here with the fog we haven't been able to see although some of the men up further up the tower say that they can still see the Griffins flying overhead I worry that what if they got there first and have whatever it is and they're moving on this might be a chance that we stopped them I might be wrong but no but we can't let them if they have one of the badges and we're gonna get there and then find out that they already have it get who the badges is the key to winning this war yeah don't know do they know about the badges how much do they know and it's just and where did they last see them or where did they first see them they came up from a long temple road came through the Market Square and headed then towards the Castle Road and they didn't stop at all not that we could see okay because maybe there maybe I'm wrong but they might maybe they're just doing some scatter but they're onto something me there's no reason for the 30 for scouting I doubt it okay well they're up to something do we follow them do we sneak behind them do we try to learn what they're up to you think if we're on our path towards what I don't know but I'm excited I can make us all look like all of us all of us I can make us all look like silver order that would be fun if we can come you have to sneak no yeah we don't have to sneak we just walk out of an alleyway in with them and start talking to them about what their plans are mm-hmm okay we need you buddy like mind-reading like magic what do I have what do I have if you wish to do that and assume the order the the appearance of members of the silver order you should probably start thinking about what your alibi is and what names you're going to give because the members of the silver order are organized enough to know each other by name we tried this before with the other yeah but we didn't have as much magic as we have now also what if we try instead of to try to just talk to them what if we just use the seeming as like a pirate ship coming up on someone and we just pull the pirate flag right at the last second so it's not just about so we're just going that tight it's just getting up to them not interacting so we just to close the gap so we can understand more about what we could try diplomacy but with the intention of as soon as it sounds like it's failing yeah we pull the veil out yeah and let me go what's a bird hey friend hey old friends that's not gonna cause distrust at all or what if we taunt them and we pretend to be monsters what if we do go up to them but maybe it's just the Caspian and we take maybe the Rangers we do a little bit stealthy and we're there as secret support just in case me Jupiter and the Caspian approach that way it's less about let me go hey silver order what you doing in the city right now so you're saying I won't use magic to make this insanely cool okay no you can still do it no I don't want to waste a fifth level spell but on a hot plan well I like that idea what do you think I can be sneaky I can I can stealth around with these guys yeah and then I can even pass without a trace so that way we can get close enough surround them and then that way if he needs a porpoise okay that's that's a big group to hit I know it I don't think the intention is to hurt them well you are we had open war we said we're at open war kind of it we're kind of an open war technically they don't know that we know yet like that we haven't spoken letters around okay mailed us that the big filter is do we care about them or do we care about getting the badge or getting the badge but what if they have the patch already then we take the bat that's why I asked if they stopped along the way it sounds like they didn't if we're headed towards it they didn't stop at Market Square but we don't know what they did up north mmm Lord Commander they passed this way only about an hour ago but if they're up to something we better act quickly I think it's up to You Lord Commander keeping out of the way of the Griffins is gonna be important and seeing if we can at least sneak past worse comes to worse we we use it as a information mission and if we have to battle we have to battle I don't know we've got a squad here do you want us to come with you or do you want us to hold this point Oh hold this point okay I can go with the Caspian but with greater and visibility on ya yeah that'd be good and then you and the hooded lanterns up in the open the roofs or something yeah stay away from the eyes of reference uh okay maybe not on the roof back alleys we can take we take the back alleys um worse comes to worse I can fog cloud on the Griffins that are up ahead so that way they can get less visibility or great above us it is pretty means already foggy it's a pretty day so they have low visibility as it is so if you're in the alleys and they're up in the air the Griffins are in the air they won't see you okay do it should we call in reinforcements we don't need them I have a staff okay magic you have a squad you have a squad I have a squad of spells so the idea is to go up see if they're already here see what they're up to if we have to battle we have to battle but the key thing is we need to get the badge they don't have a badge this is bail yeah how are you gonna are you gonna okay you know what I'm gonna leave it to you you figure out if they have a patch oh okay well you're the one approaching them to converse Hey all right yes as you head out the Castle Road oh the fog and Miss Park into the large old common plaza the plaza itself at the center of the plaza is the common hall itself it is a large stately building roughly in a sea kind of this elongated sea shape so there's two wings coming out to the sides and then this large Statehouse that's about four stories high with steepled high hall windows and these very very high sharp rooftops that all come up to in the center there is this kind of bell tower of its of its own that looks out over the entire square the building itself is about four storeys tall so about 100 feet at its highest point of the tower so it's by no means that one of the tallest buildings in the city but definitely one of the larger buildings in in the city itself coming up to the plaza from the street there is a large fountain and several pillars and these statues of prominent citizens are all marked around the edges of the Hall of the building as well from what you recall of the building itself the majority of the building on the ground level is the court itself that is both used as a courthouse and a council chamber and then the upper chambers are the offices of the Lord Mayor and the other administrators of the city there's a great set of double doors and various balconies overlooking out onto the plaza and there you can see one of the wings of the building has partially collapsed the roof says have fallen in and the sides are all scattered about and you can see the remnants of several offices all covered up in in the rubble and in the central plaza of the building the see that is formed around the fountain there is an assembly of silver order knights and they have about a dozen horses with them as well and you see as you come through the clouds and as you catch sight of them you can hear this loud screech and a horn call coming from as a Griffon rider swoops around and swoops back down towards the group of knights and in the midst of them they as that as the group of you kind of begins to split up and and split off how our unit you're gonna the cassadines are going to approach and the hooded lanterns and the rest are gonna head out with stealth yeah okay so Sebastian you're casting greater visibility and going with pollute oh is that correct well greater invisibility only last minute so I might actually approach with stealth and well they're talking I might try to okay sneak in okay so Vale and Sebastian I'm gonna have both of your all stealth checks with advantage cuz you're with the hooded lanterns and as a group you can all hide up in one of the alleys okay yeah I want to I want us to try to get into I'm wondering if we need pass without trace yeah yeah okay I'm gonna cast pass without trace just to make sure a group of us aren't super stealth that's a +10 with passed without race right yep yep and passed without a trace affects the whole squad as well yeah buddy within 30 feet of me yes okay I got a 35 okay damn 42 oh my god all right so okay so with unprecedented stealth the turn around and you guys are gone just just got yeah just gone you John you've got this and pollute Oh as you and Jupiter head towards the group of assembled Knights you can see that the doors have been opened and there and they are lighting up higher where they are burning the piled bodies of several trolls where as we approach with military formation we're also kind of like I want to use like an approach that's very passive okay so like not as far as like holding a white flag but something that shows that we're non-combat if yeah okay whatever that formation is in military things I do that sauntering these ice hunter I saunter up to them do my fan dance group of knights step into formation and out in the front of the formation is night captain Theodore Marshall hail night captain Theodore Marshall my design gluto Jackson well hey old friend I see you've done some city sweeping impressive work we have indeed what do you do you are here just as Ophelia said you'd be here oh did she she's been watching she's been praying she's been communing with the flame and she said that you and your friends would be coming here today so I thought that this would be a good opportunity for us to meet on relatively neutral ground and talk things out one last time we're your friends agreed my friends are close by I assume so you got a few of them up hadn't in the in the windows they they're keeping a safe distance make captain a watchful eye if you feel very well I'll leave it up to them that aside if you want to speak for them that's your business well as the most charismatic group player leader of this fine ragtag group of I don't know if you know what we're called we're actually called the Jackson 3 did you know that that's like very common misconception anyways what I really want it's that our interests in drag and I might not be so different I see no reason for bloodshed now or in the future night captain and Jupiter Jones speaks up and regardless if there is it'll be illyrian blood spilt not a drop of Caspian blood I'm just gonna like give him one of the like that alright alright big guy Sebastian uh starts seeing through his Crowley and he's flown the crow over to the okay mountain and he's just chillin there listening in alrighty I'm getting more and more upset and the whole time I'm gonna be using no your enemy on night captain on that I captain okay Jupiter Jupiter Jones quiets himself for a moment what do you want to learn with night with no your enemy I want to know his strength strength score and his AC if they are superior or inferior 220 and 220 they are his armor class is superior and his strength is equal to kill and this is I just squinty eye and it's really the ability is I think I could take him that's the name of it that's how I always picture it it's just I think I could take them Pluto you must know by now the hierarchs decree I know you Caspian Zahn pious folk but we're all bound together in the flame and well it was up to me I wouldn't want to shed any blood whatsoever it is up to you and the flame stands for something that goes further than the decree of one we're not pawns in some political game this isn't this isn't a dick this isn't just words being said this is people's lives and this is an entire city I'm ready and we are ready in the silver order to do what has to be done here in Drakon Heim and end the darkness and corruption that has taken root here once and for all and I'm asking you as friends as brothers and arms one time to find a reason and truth in the lat we could be allies for a righteous cause stand with us I I can't stand with you until you can free yourself from the chains of the sacred flame it used to stand for something that was bigger than people and right now you're being controlled by the what's the name of the high the high higher the IARC yeah you don't listen to your heart not to your orders and you will see what's right and you will see that we are here to cleanse the evil from Jack and I blaspheme sir it is not for you or I to question the wisdom of the higher who speaks for the flame itself communes directly with the saints and the martyrs that have shed blood through this world for ages untold you could bask in the light with us and we could do what has to be done for this city if you don't that makes us enemies yep you are tell about Ignatius I slowly pull out Ignatius I see that blade this blade stands for more than the hierarch more than the sacred flame it it reveals the truth and the truth is beyond you or me or any other mortal that stands to try to gain from the death and the suffering of those that it can that it considers its followers if the hayek truly believed in desecrating the evil and saving Drakon higher words stop in your throat as you say those words and Ignatius cries out to you the high arc is the voice of truth itself ir speaks for the flame how dare you I searched by the Jama vacuum you're ruining my flower dare you claim to speak for the flame you know not it's will you are not the arbiter of its truth sorry you know Jackson let's sort away put the sword away Plato panics and tries to jam the sword back in trying to kind of like muffle it like you know when something's like crying lord sorry the the night captain continues and says whoops you should only draw that blade if you're gonna turn it over to us okay I'll keep it away the Paladins and flame keepers of the sacred fire are the rightful consists OD ins of the blade of Saint Petruchio now [Music] I think I have some valuable and he reaches in and he produces a a circlet that has a monocle with it I found this in the Lord Mayor's office upstairs I think this might be one of your little badges of office of the city I believe it is we're willing to work with you return Ignatius and I'll give this to you how far away are they for me about 200 feet all right go to a Sebastian I say I think I can get it I think you can too I don't know if I'm strong enough mmm he I have a trick want to make me invisible and I can run and get it I'm gonna step back a moment I just I kind of like I'm off my toes and I'm on my heels cuz now I'm starting to contemplate this decision he puts he puts it away change it on his belt and he says out of that you can either take that deal right now little Jackson or I have no doubt that if we continue on the course that we do I'm gonna have to send many good men to their men and women to their deaths at your hands they will be resolute before this grim undertaking they will not relent they will not surrender and they will not give up the strength of the sacred fire endures when the strength of the body fails make no mistake if you want to hide in the darkness and say that you're wielding the light because you've got your hands on the blade Ignatius you'll be destroyed and consumed by it there's no honor to be had and cutting down those who I called brothers and sisters in arms and there is no need to pay this price and blood I beg you spare their lives and your own and spare your lives the lives of these men and fat me here now you want to fight me for I've heard you fought many monsters but have you ever fought a man yeah looks like a monster to me I got your back man I'll do this I can help maybe I'm not one to turn down a challenge night captain but I have to I have to challenge your hypocrisy you can't say you're not might you stand this challenge you to a duel man where's your Caspian honor it's right here and I just sorry I'm just here I go killing again as you - as' it drops to the ground like a rock aah and it says I will not be worn in battle against a righteous soul Ignatius if you're gonna have performance problems you need to do this on our own time this this needs to be I need you running at a hundred percent right now make it make it charisma a check this is a test of wills against Ignatius yeah come on Ignatius 16 you need to be the 20 sir so I get to add anything to it I don't have anything to add to it but do I get to add Ignatius it currently weighs 1,000 pounds oh and I can lift 999 pounds so it's like I'm really quiet effectively like it's just like rock and and the blade says I will not I will not Jupiter Jones says you can borrow my sword if you like Oh I mean thanks Jupiter it really means a lot that badge Oh imma get it I'm gonna make you envision um what are the terms of our engagement you are not one-on-one no one else if anyone else interferes none of my men will none of your men will two men two blades two shields okay but I get to choose the weapons what weapons you can have the the long sword that I took from what's-his-face is body the night captain the night one of the night Bertrille Virgil you can use Virgil's sword and I returned it in honor Senna and I will use Jupiter where you got I need some any suddenly he gives you a one of his long sword sits a casseon blade okay I know no Griffins yeah and no Griffins no my Griffin will you and I man to man okay I accept your challenge guys I'm panicking do we interfere do you think we can interfere I don't I think it's like a troll situation remember we done this we did this a Jupiter you got this do you think they'll notice if you have taken subtle spell and what are the and and may I ask the winner what is the prize [Music] well if I win I want to challenge sebastian crow to a duel next and then I want to challenge veo Sonia to a duel after that take the strongest last no you're strong you know combat Oh in both cases I can do that okay weakest last week what is your I believe quite simply [Music] it's my fault I put trust in you I believed in you three I thought you were heroes and I told I misled my men into putting their faith into you and I will shed my own blood before I let a single one of them die at your hands this is my atone this is how I asked for forgiveness I can't we don't have to do this this way you you can give up the sword you can't sway me it's very easy return ignatius corruption has gripped Queen Lenore let death and her waking nightmare let her soul be free abandon your foolish attachment to that amethyst Academy they only want promise and power they only care for themselves they do not have the best answers to the city at heart they don't we could stop the queen of Thieves we could reclaim the castle we'll burn the city to the ground but it'll be a new city we could all work together but if you're not you want to sway me you want to convince me that's all you have to do that's all I'm asking that's all gluto put him on his righteous ass what do you say Sebastian he's full of it he raises some valid points but not enough valid points I eat Knights like him for breakfast I have a few more one-liners can you guys give me some night captain the one thing I have to admire about you is your resolve and your dedication to something bigger than yourself and I hope you can see the same in me that's why it's regrettable that it's come to this and I'm gonna kind of walk back to Jupiter I hope your soul finds peace in the lat I'm gonna bow to him and retrieve the sword we're doing this I think we gotta let him do it I don't think if we interfere we're gonna have to kind of have to kill 30 men I'd rather just watch Pluto kill him yeah and as I'm facing Jupiter Jones I'm going to drink a potion of invulnerability okay as night the night captain takes Virgil's sword and he places it to his forehead it says Virgil I'm sorry that you had to die my friend let this at all let me take up your blade and atone for your death and the blade glows with holy fire I really shouldn't have given him that right but it was fair it's the right thing to do all right are you ready I'm as ready as I'll ever be roll for initiative what you got five you got a five all right with advantage with your shield I mean can you just rub it in okay the the night captain goes first absolutely you three can also roll initiative if you would like 17 you guys got my back ready I'll try oh man Sebastian what you got I got a five as well I'll go after if you want you can go before y'all have Pluto go first okay all right Vail you see that they're about to join battle and the would you like to do anything I am going to yeah we can have a little bit of a setting here oh no I'm really sorry night captain tonight commanders captain so he said we can't interfere with the battle right yes just what I heard yeah is there anything that you would like to do yes how far away am i I'm gonna say that if you if you and the hood of lanterns with your high stealth if you wanted to take positions up in the ruined part of the building you could do that in the yeah yeah I think if we're here yeah on that part that should be good sure um if I'm miner illusion that doesn't lose my concentration on possible trees correct or no it no it does not does telepathic bond require an action to use or is it just noble you just have telepathy I just say to Pluto ready to get pumped up guys if things go sideways the most important thing is to get the badge no matter what of course and get out of there and try to save Jupiter and myself if we can are you guys fighting to the death or is this like a you're gonna spare each other I mean I'm I as as the battle is joined the night captain says now if your friends want to come I don't know where your friends are hiding but if they want to watch you die they should probably get out here before we get started and as he says this you start to hear a chorus of Pluto no as I minor illusion these voices that start to rise around minor illusion back behind their troops the same thing so it just sounds like a circle of chanting Kay my fans are always watch up alright sorry are you gonna reveal your position or keep hiding or I'm gonna keep hiding okay so anything else fail yep okay the night captain he steps forward taking Virgil's blade and he calls upon the light and says I don't I'm sorry I have to do this and attacks the first is is only a 17 okay second is a 29 that hit hits and he blinding smites you okay so he the damage on the attack itself is it's gonna be 13 slashing damage and the blinding smite goes off with a thunderous crash of Holy Light and you need to make a constitution saving care of my friend I get advantage because he's right beside me and I get a 24 okay so you are not blinded which is great but you still take an ad that was three eights you say he'll take an additional 24 radiant damage so it's haft yeah as of the invulnerability so 13 and 24 so 6 and 12 or 7 and 12 who round up four down so it was Racine on 13 plus 24 is 37 so yeah just take a half round up 16 no 20 set genome 16 no no 37 is you think 18 points et thank you thank you I'm gonna repost on the cat no way I don't have reactions yet do I know you do I want to repost on the first attack okay and I get a 22 that is a hit and he takes 22 damage 22 damage 22 oh that's from the extra - because you're not you're wielding you're not wielding Ignatius @ d8 + addi 1022 yeah +7 any anything else he makes his third attack getting a 25 - hits that hits for another 14 points of damage alright I accept I accept out no it's your turn no okay no am I gonna swing 25 to head as a hit and I want him to make a strength saving throw he gets an 18 no okay he's gonna take [Music] fifteen damaged okay and I'm gonna hit him again Dada Dada and I miss spectacularly already and then I'm going to try to knock him from okay and I get a 20 I get a 22 darn it okay sorry a 23 okay I try to knock them around with my shield and we start exchanging blows and it's cool it's so cool we're just friendly it's a friendly battle ready the friendly fun bow sebastian you see the fight unfold I'm not supposed to mess with this but if I remember correctly in the fight against Jupiter I molded earth underneath his feet to make it difficult to it now that's not going to work I don't know what to do I don't know I don't know man since I haven't been seen yet and since I'm on the back lines is it possible for me it's a cast haste without being noticed and are the problem you have subtle spell know how loud do I have to talk that's the thing is I have to speak in arcane where words speak and the effect of the spell will absolutely be visible to everybody if you cast a spell on him well then I guess I just watch alright we go back to the top fail I don't know again the rules were that we don't directly interfere correct what are you thinking you should consider consider who you're dealing with and consider how they might interpret any sort of interference just saying if the weather changes like a lightning bolt hit someone person I cast it's not weird fog cloud right beside them the fog rolls in but doesn't reach them okay there's a general commotion from amongst the group of assembled Knights at this and they they look at that and they're like is that the hay is rolling in that what what's there very confused by it it's the haze shadow maybe bigger than that it's a 20 but 20 footer it is okay it slightly bigger than this okay and I go to Pluto my head and I say mmm there's your cover you need it oh thank you looks like thanks thanks the night captain looks at that and says that's that's strange that's dragon time any look looks at you it's like do you want to stop or do you want to continue we continue fine so be it and he resumes his attack we don't have house electricity this time he gets a twenty two hit um I'm gonna use shield from the ring of smell storing cool right raises your AC up to 25 he attacks again this time getting a that one's gonna be 25 that hits and he is going to cast wrathful smite on this one so you're gonna take a total of four psychic damage and 14 but slashing damage so 18 totals or 9 points and you need to make a wisdom saving throw oh I'm gonna use indomitable okay huh I get a 21 okay you are not frightened by him that's key he makes one last attack which is a 26 to hit for another 10 points of damage see claws in with his weapons okay uttering the litanies of the silver flame on his lips of the sacred fire on his lips the litany of sacred fire I respond in jest with some Caspian terms like for Blau and kerplunk and i get critical time i just have to use my cast me in battle or it clip that but what i want to do is also have a make a strength saving throw cool he gets a fourteen he drops his sword okay and he takes 14 damage okay and then i'm gonna hit him again nice and i get a 25 to hit 25 that is a hit and he has to make on let me just check [Music] another strength saving throw awesome he gets a 18 he succeeds cool but takes another 24 damage that leaves him bloodied and then pushing attack or sorry a 28 strength check and I gotta push him back five feet okay push him back five feet and he's got beat at 28 he does not so he gets pushed back five feet and I'm standing on his sword okay alrighty and that's my turn I wa ignatius get up I really need you right now buddy he that's Pluto and I go and I say yield as the sword hits the ground I'm going to just from back where I am caught doom old earth to push the sword towards Pluto okay so that the sword just slides so it hits the ground and slides I just like lifts the earth a little so was she okay make a stealth check behind me it like it slides through my blade yeah like it slides back behind you a stealth check mm-hmm no pass with no trace right sorry 25 okay it doesn't seem like any of the silver order knights noticed that and so that is that this sword is now behind Pluto Jack yeah and I'm imposing myself kind of like between okay this is a nail-biter careful okay and we go to the top with Vail again I'm watching this and I don't want to interfere too much but from oh that's too far um again I'm minor illusion the sound and this time it's a whisper and it's all it's saying is Pluto the flame Pluto the flame Pluto the flame and that's all it's whispering behind you just to freak everybody else and I just keep a watchful life okay I'm really just messing with everyone's heads here and then in in you know actual head I'm like Pluto don't forget the fog thank you all righty the night captain stands back grabs his shield and throws it at you no and it bursts into flames as it does so as it soars directly at you told you the flame and he gets a twenty two hit dragon advantage because and is it is it like an attack attack uh yeah it's an attack I'm gonna cash shield again okay so it it you deflect it with the field it bounces back to him and he throws and he throws it back at you once again oh so he's like pinging them off the shield yeah pinging them off the shield you're getting a 21 the third time and he gets a 20 for the the last time and then he's just gonna rush forward and reach for the sort and rush around you and pick the sword up on the other side just with his movement he's still in your range okay yeah I'm going to try to take like the opportunity of him like running around to try to well like this yeah he's gonna run around me yeah he's just moving because you moved the sword only five feet to the other side so he just chases after it and scoops it scoops it up yeah because Sebastian only moves at five feet with that so it's it's enough for him to get back to it and rush by the way I kind of imagined it is he's like throwing the shield and relying on the moment while you're blocking it to Russia you with shield to rush up forward to try to snatch it up and because you've used your reaction this turn as well the cache shield you're spending all your focus defending on yourself from those attacks that you're not able to prevent him from picking up the sword so he picks up his sword and then I'm just gonna I'm gonna swing at him again alrighty and I get a it's a I'm gonna use precision strike to make it a 30 oh man that's so it hits I don't think a 20 would hit and it's gonna be 17 damage okay and then I'm gonna swing at him again and I get a 27 to hit also a hit for 14 damage okay and I'm going to I get like a 14 to knock him prone he stay standing okay cool wham Wham Sebastian vayo do you want to enter see intervene no I just want to continue to my minor illusion like scary sounds okay just sounds that like Roland intimidation Jack can I help 14 Bao's doing it with her with her magic sure yeah you can help them give her advantage because if you add your magic to it oh yeah 20 so I'll have the the Lord commits of the night captain iike my wisdom save he fails so I'm gonna say that he's got a disadvantage on his next attack just because the support around him whoa my friends yeah there's like chanting and cheering for Pluto flame chooses you Pluto so the Lord so that the the night captain hearing hearing all that he swings out and he's like light do not abandon me now and he swings to attack Pluto and that crit turns into a Miss OH oh my friends he swings again was psychic swings again getting a big old not enough to hit and one last time with a natural one so you just swings he's on doesn't make it any of the end none of the attacks in that great illusion Pluto it's over to you I'm going to cast from my ring reduce on him okay does it just happen he's got to make a saving throw I don't know what Elliot and it's the saving throw from the wizard that put it yeah and I assume it was the high mage it's like a level 30 wizard I've AIDS it's gonna be DC 15 okay and I just need to check the sir I didn't have it handy that's okay I just needed to double check on the saving throw type Constitution yeah he saves Darren Constitution I forgot it's Constitution okay and then I'm gonna action search and just swing an atom oh this time I get a yeah like a 12 and then the second hit okay that's better 26 that is a hit for 11 damage okay and that's my turn I'll try to knock him is he like is if we pivoted to the point where he's near the fog or anything I know he pivoted to the other side but he's not on the fog bank 22 to push him prone he gets a 20 okay so you knock him down on his turn he he Springs to his feets and the end continues his attack everything's fine he's fine getting a 20 and a natural one and a 24 to both those hit both of them hit okay he is going to blinding smite so the two attacks that hit do a total of 16 points of damage and save against the blinding spine and is it Khan yeah it's a Constitution saving throw hmm like a 26 cool you're good you still hate 20 points of radiant damage oh yeah Oh bleh oh man he's late me up the resistance is helping believe it or not but I still AM I'm very blood I'm bloody okay just for the record I think the attack maybe but right before that it bloodied me awesome I believe is your turn Pluto I I blew through all of my super that's why all the damage really took a took a steep drop-off I should have enlarged myself I was really trying to hit him okay that's better 27 to hit that is a hits 415 damage okay and I'm gonna hit him again Oh 19 to hit I miss miss and and then I'm going to this time use second wind to heal myself 417 nice okay just we're just just pounding away on each edge wailing on each other in the rain and the mud and the fog as you continue to just beat at each other as hard as possible ah I miss you friend from the outside nice nice alrighty I minor illusion the sound of ignatius voice you've never heard that before hmm it only it only speaks in Pluto's head you know what does Ignatius sound like can you telepathically with us do your best impression and I'm gonna do the kind of busy I don't know if I can give you voice lessons right now like think of no you're distracting me sorry just a mean guy sounds like a mean sword I I'm miner illusion of voice coming from the sword that's lying on the ground and I go maybe he hasn't heard Ignatius either right yeah so a miner illusion a voice coming from the the sort the Ignatius sword lying on the ground and I go Elias Drexel the flame is not with you today okay making an intimidation check I got a 10 not enough do you think love the voice you squeal you squealing you go the flame it's not with you today lawyers yeah and you do it sorry no I tried my best it's not what it sounds like you know what you did your best buddy that's what I appreciate all right cool cool cool you're welcome right the the night captain continues as a sod Elias Trachsel I see cries Drexel that's why I didn't work you said Elias directly set a theater martial that's one way to seems futile Isis back there all these names I'm sorry I'll see myself out no you're doing great keep trying I don't like from the fog cloud I do again a whispering not angry voice but a stern voice they say the flame is with Pluto and it just kind of repeats for a minute kind of wavering in and out in volume okay I will let Sebastian reroll that intimidation check with your support this time we didn't say the wrong name is the other guy down 21:21 the commander the the night commander will have disadvantage on the seeds of doubt have been planted in his mind and he and waveringly he attacks Pluto again this time only getting a 18 hits and he proceeds to attack two more times getting a 20 and a 20 to his they both it alrighty so that first one's gonna be 14 damage the second one is going to be 10 damn and he will also apply his branding smite to to that and I believe I forgot what branding smite does that's why it's 2d six extra radiant damage and that's pretty much it so that's an extra eight radiant damage as he houses the flame is with the easy says the flame is with me and I've got no doubt in my mind that what I do is rat I won't let doubt take seed in my heart I'll strike you down I will strike you down about the that huh and I'm not as quippy with my kill I usually fight monsters and they don't talk as much yeah so I'm not as used to like the back and forth so I'm kind of catching my footing here it's new territory but I'm always down to kill new things you know try new things killing things and can I swing at him yep sweet I'm gonna swing at him I get a 20 that is it a 22 hit or natural 2020 to hit that is a Miss and then swing out him again this time I get a 23 that is a hit 413 damage 13 okay he's still standing he is wounded just like he spits out some of his teeth but he he grits them and is poised to strike one more time and night captain there is no glory in the dead for the we we can end this now I ask you I beg you yield make your persuasion check not very good at this 18 he replies and he says my friend I can't speak against you to the hierarchy but I can't let you kill I won't be the one I need to atone for this there's no there's no blood on your hands that we can end this there already is let's not put more as was his blade and we did right we killed the a horror together in Drakon hime the Lord of the feast and Virgil died fighting for something bigger than him not some higher arc not some some person commanding him he died because he wanted to rid the city of evil and we can do that together he says you made your choice Virgil made his choice and I made mine I'm gonna give him my last bit of strength and if you're still standing after that you can strike me down and he swings the his weapons one last time getting a twenty one to hit a 12 to hit and a sixteen to hit so one hits all righty and he does one last smite for a total of twenty points of damage it's your turn as he makes his final onslaught and you batter off his attacks he lands that one last blow and he sees that you're still standing you see that there's like a look of I know it's over now in his face and in that moment I just drop Jupiter's sword on the ground this is over and I offer and I reach out my hand he's my captain there's no more blood that needs to be shed but I need that badge he looks at his soldiers and he says I'm not gonna strike down a man that's not holding a weapon now you picked that sore back up and you finish what you started it I will and I'm gonna reach back and grab old javelin and I'm gonna stab them alright go for it stab up with my javelin no not no not 23 to hit it is a hit for nine damage you stabbed night captain Theodore Marshall in the heart with the spear ah he lets go of his sword and he grabs it and he pulls the spear a bit closer towards you he says my friend I'm sorry I couldn't speak against you but now there's no one to speak for you either you died with honor I hope not in vain and I release them down to the ground off my spear and that's where we're gonna take our break welcome back we are back from our break and ready to take on the ruins again but before

Theodora Marshall and he slumps to the ground dead and the stunned silence descends over the plaza the night's look at each other and they look at the body of their commander there's silence I I lay him down gently and I remove the circlet from his waistband or however he had it attached and I walked back over to Jupiter as you do Cassandra Wyatt one of the night captain's wingman swoops down and you can hear that and then she does so there's a screech from the night captains Griffin as it swoops forward over the body of the night captain and is just screeching in rage and it's and as you back off it screeches at you like this and Cassandra Wyatt flies down beside and she says take you trinkets get away goodbye don't be mad he didn't give us a choice I try to pick up Ignatius Ignatius you can lift the blade but it is not illuminated 7 a temper tantrum a we good are we cool are we cool but there's no reply so keep them well we'll deal with McNay she is temper tantrum later and I I do one of those like when you're standing really far away from your friends I like hold the circle it which are where I kind of think they are the I'm pretty sure we can still talk that how long does this last for an hour as you walk away Jupiter Jones says that was phenomenal my friend well done Bravo drew Caspian honor on display right there you illyrian should all take note he's so gonna say that Pluto Jackson is a dishonorable man he has given your captain all the honor do a proper Caspian duel he could not have asked for a better death I'm like not celebrating like I'm walking and he's like cheering yeah I'm like walking with my head cut it down like aa dart it like I got the circle it but I didn't want to kill the night captain but my hand was forced him as you turn away there's you hear the squeaky voice cry out from amongst the Knights and this this voice reflects it says hi Charlie I turn around and there's this younger Knight may be a squire pointing his his sword up at you and he says I challenge you come on you want another duel and as he does so another night turns around beside and says yeah I challenge you to come on you want it and another one of the Knights says I challenge you you can find us all one after the other I step out the circle and I jump down and okay and Vale jumps down and I go stand next to Pluto thank you and I hold my staff out and I'm just like your night commander was one of the greatest fighters that we've ever seen better than any of you Pluto Jackson just took him down without breaking a sweat don't don't sweat I'm kind of sweating Shh it's really sweaty in here do any of you really feel like dying today because your commander was stubborn Jupiter Jones speaks up if the boy wants to duel with Pluto Jackson let him it's his own funeral I growl at Jupiter say shut up Jupiter I think you know what I love the enthusiasm I I think maybe uh I'll kind of let my what you're gonna let you're gonna turn down a duel he just challenged you man I think you have a little bit to learn about honor listen kid don't let your emotions get the best of you I don't have any quarrel with you it's think it's time that we both went our separate ways okay the three of you can make a group persuasion check 20 come on dice ten fourteen the the Knights they Kassandra Wyatt looks over and says I reckon that sounds like cowards talk to me you wanna back down right now after you just killed the most honorable man any of us ever knew I walk up to her not walk up but I stepped towards her and I say it was an honorable battle on his terms he made his choice to do this and he put his blood before yours do you really want to do dishonor to his will cool make a hard persuasion check it's gonna be tricky harsh yeah this is gonna be hard one see 12 she says he did he died for all the rest of us and all of us all the rest of us would lay down our lives for him what would you lay your life down for for drokken home for this city well then I reckon now it's chance this battle between us is not for the city it's for your own stubborn pride it's not worth me putting my life down for for you to get back at us for a noble battle - you wanna jump what can I use know your enemy I want to know her if she's got a better or worse AC than me and and total class levels I'm ten for Cassandra yeah so I go I don't use class levels for my NPCs spoiler alert I don't I don't use the I just make it all up so yeah AC and current hit points I mean it's not hard to beat 28 but she's got 112 hit points ac under her is lower than mine okay Cassandra we don't want to kill any more nights of the silver order today so I suggest that you take your men and women here and march along because you've only seen what one of us can do you haven't seen what happens when you take on all three of us and that's gonna be a bad choice so I suggest take your pride and think about what's happened here today and then we'll come back and we'll have a chat okay make an intimidation check twelve she says guess it's time to fight get loose just get loose she she says do you wanna don't want to fight honorably if you want to back away from it here and now she turned turns around to the other nights don't let a captain's death be in vain let's take him down roll for initiative Oh [Music] why were my role so bad there's ago and during this brief interaction and took a short rest I was able to recover I'm fine so if you wanted to take a potion afterwards you could uh you can can take one one potion yes yeah and if I mix two potions you can take one potion you've done a drink one yeah but he's already drinking the potion of its own and that's the yep so roll a d20 and so on a one and a roll I'm gonna drink okay a potion of healing no I can use your even the ointment right yeah that doesn't count as a potion okay I'll use some of the anointment okay how much is the rege a man's 18 thank you okay alrighty so we have the silver order Griffin riders and the silver order soldiers roll initiative for them Wow okay the Griffin riders are probably gonna go first and less of a hold something lighter 1010 Sebastian 2020 okay and Pluto 19 oh wow okay so they'll you're actually dead last haha surprise surprise yeah alrighty so here's what we got we got a whole bunch of silver order soldiers and then we have the two silver order Griffon riders and what we'll do is we'll move Cassandra down to the ground there as well which one's Cassandra she's the one on the the far window yeah Oh Mike put her down and as battle is drawn the knight captain's Griffon scoops up his body and begins flying away okay so that bad Griffin's gone okay good good good okay unless Griffin's okay Onis so the first to act are actually the the Griffon riders so Cassandra and Owen who you both remember and Owen uh Owen swoops down from above takes his Lance and he's gonna go right for veo Mayo and leave him on his on a flight stand because he has reach on his Lance so he comes down with the lance and attacks of a Oh getting a 24 and an 18 two hits oh that okay Oh actually sir II know he has advantage so that the first ones a 24 and the second one is a 24 as well because he has mounted combatant so gosh okay and so with two hits biggle d12 that is gonna be a total of 17 points of damage from the Lance attacks and then he swoops back up on the Griffon back up into the air higher and then Cassandra is going to go rate for Pluto she flies forward hi and so she's on smaller flying sand and she gets a 26 oh my god and a 23 two hits both it for a grand total of 20 points of piercing damage with her two attacks Wow okay I accept gracefully and she's got reach as well she does yeah she has 10-foot reach and they both fly up so they are both thirty feet up in the air we get Maddie here we can just bail telepathically bail bail it is someone staying pork chops in my head or do we just murder all the ground to lift eight we haven't even tried yet we don't know how tough yeah we could we could murder all the ground people and then the flying people say flies it's Sebastian it is Sebastian's turn sebastian steps forward and he looks at the row of soldiers in front of him and he goes soldiers flame be with you any cost fire [Laughter] oh no the fire nice and that should that should affect quite a few of them there that was really cool okay yeah so this so I yell flame be with you and then I throw my staff and a line across them and you just see fire shoot out of the ground nice erupting along the first line of them and burning back towards them so yeah it's what is it when you create the wall of fire each creature within its area must make a dexterity saving through when the wall of fire appear each creature within its area must make a dexterity saving throw on a failed save the creature takes 5 d 8 fire damage so I got a lot of them back there there's a there's a lot of guys back there so they all gotta make their within 10 feet of the wall outside and what's the DC 17 only one of them yeah fire wall do you need d8 I need one more gate kablammo y'all stick with that already 26 damaged 26 all the ones that failed they're savers are dead Oh roasted alive and you hear the screams of the of the young squire and the young Knights as they are burned alive in the wall afire and in Sebastian's eyes you see the flames his he smirks and he goes sorry boys you wanted it the flame is now with you the flavor ever is know if you I fist pump you in the battlefield but we also realize how dark it is because we just murdered like magic and dark and sad give a man fire he's warm for a day light a man on fire he's warm the rest of his life alright pollute oh it's over to you and as I say that old caspian saying and you can hear Cassandra crowd no as she watches them all burn away like a fire the option to walk away Hydra bra and her name was Cassandra can I assume they're on kind of like are they up both at 30 feet yes they are okay and they're they close to each other they are in separate squares okay bit but beside each other pacing and I just Huck my javelin okay Cassandra okay I get a pardon 22 a 22 is a hit on Cassandra for 8 damage for 8 damage okay and then I and then I huh and I get a 24 that is also a hit for 11 damage okay nice and then there's no other guards around me right I know there's a few other soldiers around there's five that have survived and we're gonna have Jupiter and his men go at the end of the round and yep and also the hooded land yeah yeah okay an answer yep then that's my turn yeah okay Vail you're up um I just take one look at Cassandra and I say you wanted this mess and I use my bonus action to Zephyr strike to give advantage and I take three shots at her nice here we go bail 1919 is a hit and here come the dates here come the dice yeah oh you want to go ranged that's fine like if you can fly 300 feet away nice 35 damage oh my now with one of your three shot nice okay okay muscle yeah you guys haven't even fought our muscle yet like I'm not even the strongest one and I killed the night captain you guys are up and second shot is only 12 that's not a hit and third is less oh it's okay man I will use my feline agility to back up actually you know what I'm not gonna use the feeling of jelly I'm just gonna use the extra movement from Zephyr strike and then I'm gonna climb the wall and up over to be beside Ansem okay and the hooded lanterns asked Lord Commander where do you want us to fire go for the Griffins okay so the hooded lanterns will break up their shots across both the Griffin riders the Griffin riders head mounted combatant so they read they take the shots themselves and so you've got five hooded lanterns on the field to hit three make hits I split up evenly between the the two of them so Owen gets crit by one of the hooded lanterns let's go and Cassandra gets hit twice nice Ansem is gonna fire his his crossbow at Cassandra and he misses unfortunately so from the hooded lanterns shots both Owen and Cassandra take 10 points of damage each and the Jupiter Jones says to hit the Caspian come on boys let's mop up the rest and they charge forward against the other this feels good other area this feels good I feel good about this and one of the last soldiers then she over there the the quivering square shoe rate she screams out loud and races towards Sebastian and stabs him a seventeen and a ten a cash shield okay I don't even look at her I just like shield off to the side and I turn around and I just and I smite her with my and I get a 22 hit that hit 410 damage okay you cleave her in Twain I stabbed her through the this and I just pull it out as you shield against it I just go thanks man got you okay and the Gryphon riders the Gryphon riders enrage both fly down on because who go for they know many options to kill are going to both decide that Sebastian has killed the most of their soldiers and both of them go for Sebastian yeah that seems fair getting a 22 hits a 22 two hits a 26 two hits and an 18 hit the 18 misses cuz my shield okay the rest hits bad one you take five hits total sorry for three hits total 1 for 14 1 for 7 and 1 for 11 and then they fly back up in the air uh-huh I get pummeled with Lance's I'm just like no problem I just got like stabbed three times and now I'm like I stopped the little girl from attacking you and if you get murdered turn dropping your guard and stab the little girl and then you turn back around and I just have to lances sticking and I'm like no I was protecting you do you have to make Khan saves yes I do for your first Khan save the Great Firewall 17 for my first conse okay that's gonna be 20 yep well then and 19 I'll save the fireball remains in effect Sebastian it's your turn I do they flew back up after they hit me I back up a bit hmm and I hold out my staff of the power and I cone of cold upwards towards them in this swirling vortex of an ice storm nice shoots out of the staff okay roll a wild magic surge because you are using the staff of power right oh yeah that does that what about that one why Oh magic I got a 96 what's the worst that could happen potted plant you and all creatures with 30 feet of you give gained vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute good weapons the Gryphon riders are are in the air they're too far far out yeah it's okay I'm still gonna holding on hear you child the wild magic after getting stabbed and the magic was like oh you like getting stabbed and like maybe more vulnerable to getting stabbed I feel more in danger [Laughter] it's a piercing that's what you end up rolling against Griffin riding Lancer plan I wish me on the potted plant I could have just kicked you towards the Griffins - all right they need to make a constitution saving throw at DC 17 they both fail and one of the Griffins succeeds all right I need a four more is that possible I got two in there too baby here's to two tubes I got sound of many dice all right and I'm gonna stick with solid yeah puto help me mass you got this [Music] so 10 28 42 damage okay 42 damage he world like five eighths on that so no you Sandra has six points for 8 to 5 of 3 mm yeah she had 112 okay and yep so Cassandra is very bloodied and Owen is extremely wounded as well and both of their and Owens Griffin is bloodied but neither of them are dead none of them are dead I yell you can still leave with your lives [Music] well it's vales turn it's it's they're soldiers they're surviving few soldiers down Remy do I get oh sorry pollute oh pardon pardon I'm just gonna throw my jab leaking at Cassandra okay you can still live with your last 20 that is a hit suffer 8 damage she is slain Oh so I look at her I'm like you could still leave and then this javelin just like flies up and no sir and she falls oh you said it too late though you said it to the other guy to go you could still live with you and I throw and I get a 26 to hit 28 to hit for 8 damage pardon me 28 to hit on ants and enemy how that is a hit for 8 damage okay [Music] I guess they can't leave with their lives yeah we use spoke too soon that's my dream you can self see oh it was already in the air when you said it I can't help it that's it's fun cool it's cool I just wanted to be dramatic they're dead now alright what we've become so she is dead the soldiers but her Griffin still alive so don't take her off off the board the soldiers fight against the Caspian yes John avoid the fire while I'm guessing they do they walk around it and fight one of the Caspian is wounded but these are veteran Caspian soldiers so they are not cut down and we go now to Vale okay oh oh [Music] nimbly she's hopping up on the wall rose effect she aims at the the curtain rider in the sky with her bow to take two shots before she does she says you know funny thing about lights there are some astral bodies in this guy that looks dark but they're so dark that they pull all the light in you have made an enemy today and she takes her shots nineteen yeah that's a hit that's right no no they owe 18 damage oh okay um 11 to hit is a miss okay and then she goes good day it's girls back down okay um because she's behind this could she hide with her bonus section yep are not blown yeah her cutting action she hides and with that the hooded lanterns consider continued their onslaught of shots and where the hail of arrows Owen is shot down and the Griffins fly off by Griffin's do they have the riders still on them the riders fall the the riders fall and the Caspian cut down the remaining illyrian soldiers I'm gonna go towards Cassandra's body and check it first step certain I feel is she still like is she is very dead because had she not been killed by this the javelin going through through her midsection falling 30 feet off of a Griffin onto the ground while you're unconscious would not be something that anyone would survive they own in Cassandra are both very dead oh there's a lot we've really lost our diplomacy and now it's full war listen we we talk it out they didn't want to polite duel and then they was stubborn paladins they just are gonna get what they deserve now the saddest part of all of this is that our friend the night commander was he really our friend though he was he put that much but he died so that none of their blood would need to be shed and then they all just oh let's go fight the master wizard the Lord Commander and the new Lord of Drakken hime that's a smart idea idiots I think if he was really our friend he wouldn't have put us in that awkward position yeah this is your fault I said pointed in his body he's surrounded by like burning corpses yeah body would be more the only thing remaining actually is his Warhammer I pointed as a friend hammer yeah-oh wants a war hammer cuz he threw down the his war hammer and Virgil's blade but his shield was strapped to strap back to his arm I pick up the war hammer and I hand it over it hey do you want a trophy for your murder huh walking around with this it was a survival and Jupiter Jones she says that was glorious spectacular the way you burned all those soldiers alive Sebastian was quite impressive where did you learn how to do that I went to school stay in school kids Jupiter you were great indeed you didn't really say that much left for us but nonetheless we got these ones it shows you that how strong we've become since you know if you want to have a friendly duel again you know all right are you challenging me to a duel we're old pals now never never challenge a cast me into a duel unless you're serious about it I challenge you to a drinking duel later you're gonna eat those words my friend literally probably I'm not a very big man guys we have a serious thing to think about where is this circle it dad where's when's it gonna be where's it gonna be safe long with us over just can't keep it with us well yeah I mean I I can't have a another one well then that's gonna be Pluto's badge for now well I'll just hang on to it I can't attune anything if it is that way but we'll have to investigate it and the Warhammer when we have some time for now let's go say we could always give the war hammer to your dad and he can make something out of it yeah okay let's just Rob all of these can we Rob all these people and throw them down that well that I can see it's a it's a you couldn't throw the minute know if you like you most of them are equipped with now burned through chainmail armor and weapons and shields the the Gryphon riders both had holy symbols of the the sacred fire and in amongst the the roof of them you actually find four potions healing and a spell scroll of bless em they weren't carrying any money on them do you want the scrolls and then we can split the healing potion yeah sure any shards no they don't keep delirium with them destroy it yeah yeah I would like to say to all of the men that fought here I know that we were all just joking and having a good time on these corpses but I think in reality I Sebastian has kind of step forward and kind of faces everybody that fought here and it's just like well everybody this is not how we intended this to go down today and it's sad that they were stubborn enough to continually push us to fight there was no need for us to shed this blood and the only thing that we can really hope for is that this bloodshed is a sign to the rest of the silver order and we are not to be messed with and as long as we stick true to what we're standing for we got to remember that we're here for Drakon hime and if people are going to try to push us around and burn this city to the ground then we need to stand up for it and unfortunately standing up for it means that occasionally we have to be standing on a battlefield like this one surrounded by all this death our hands are gonna get dirty but our allies will be our allies and our enemies regardless if they say their friends will be our enemies we'll have to take them down I don't feel good about it but yeah as long as we're doing it not for some gain you know we need to make sure it's for the right the right reasons absolutely killing trolls and Knowles and minotaurs is one thing but having to burn down an army that you once fought beside just a few weeks ago that's feels a little dirty it's it's regrettable that we couldn't see eye to eye but they're the reason why they were such a powerful friend is because they had such conviction and there's a lot of respect that comes with it but at the end of the day they weren't gonna let us just walk out of here and they weren't gonna let us continue doing what we were doing they pushed their conviction past to the point of foolishness maybe we can convince the higher to eventually turn this this this holy quest off and go back to the way things were but until then they're our enemy seems that when they're bringing war to us was this the badge that we were coming here for the Jupiter mentioned or is this a difference this when you're talking about a Jupiter and some speaks up and says that's it that's the Lord Mayor's sign this Circle it it it said that the Lord Mayor could read people's minds do we have any reason to uh it has the seal of Drakon I'm on it oh wait I guess I don't have one right now yeah not currently do you want to read minds good even though you don't have a badge I can't just go have the office and so many reason to investigate this building have have the hood lanterns been through here no we haven't it's been occupied by trolls and silver order did our work for us looks like they took some casualties in the process too but we could certainly explore through this and see if we could find anything I mentioned the Lord Commander earlier there might be archives the archives still might be here and they could have maps and schematics of the old cities sewer systems yes sewer maps well Jupiter why don't you and your men keep guard out here let us know if anything happens and we and the hooded lanterns will try to find anything important in this building the call sign is porkchop's that's a curious callsign but okay you're one of us now the doors of the common hall are open and as you push and as you head inside you can see that they after Lee after a vestibule hallway they open up into the common the common house hall itself so the whole building is called the common house hall but then this is the common house hall inside which is used as both a council chamber and a court house so there is a large magistrates pedestal with a great desk and the room in here can be arranged such that the there's benches all along the outside and a petitioner can stand in the in the middle and either petition the council or the council can all speak to each other or someone can be put on trial in in this central room there are doors leading off to the sides which have been broken open as well and there are signs of battle inside because as you come in the vestibule you can see that there are canvases placed over the bodies of about eight silver order soldiers that had that essentially may have fallen in battle against the trolls here that we're occupying this room there's the filth of the trolls layer that has been built up in the center here and there that includes trash refuse the bodies of several animals including rattling x' and even several nulls that they have been eating and feeding on and they put in the center a large cauldron with a spit roast over it that has a several that has a now cold spit of several rattling zhan skewers that they basically take in spears and put entire rattling x' on them to come you know we've done that before that's actually that was like the first thing we ate in Dragon rat kebabs with Ron kebabs and now they're our friends you guys want to eat these rats yeah let's see these rats we ever eat I can eat them up we have a way of either making friends and then eating them later or kill it like making and then killing them later like it's like a pattern what are you saying what I think you're saying that are we eating paladins now as you look around there looks like the silver order move through into this chamber but it doesn't look like they have explored much else of the area aside from fighting down the other trolls here it doesn't look like the silver order nights have passed through onto the upper onto many of the other floors although it's clearly that they obviously they have the Lord Mayor's Circle it so they may have gone up to his office okay so what sounds like they've only been down here but we want to look for books and papers that's really what we're after find the archives archives yes they might be up in the office themselves well I say with us on the hooded lanterns we break off into small little groups all right groups of three groups of three make sure to like direct them off into like groups of threes and then oh look at that we ended up together examining around the rest of the building so where are you guys gonna head head - are you gonna head up to the office that's gonna be awesome at least the the circle is yeah the upper levels of the building have are largely untouched aside from passing the the corpses of a few people who were obviously here on the day the meteor fell and most of their bodies have been stripped away as the trolls probably ate what remained of them there's kind of the outlines of the blood scrapes that things have been dragged by from you make your way up to the Lord mayor's office and the doors have been kicked open and the lock smashed and it looks like some of the papers were were ransacked around and but looking around Vail make an investigation check seven you look about the only thing that you tell is it doesn't look like the doors were smashed recently looks like they were smashed out a long time ago looks like this wasn't the Paladins mm-hmm maybe the thieves yeah there's not much remaining of the trolls either they were burning their their bodies and everything like that so do we have from our records a picture of what the mayor would have looked like yeah there's a hall leading up to the lord mayor's office and there are several pictures of the the various Lord mayors that have served the city and you can see that the the last Lord Merriman named Tom's Woodman Tom's bud the rah-rah Bueller Elms bud he was a very portly looking man and he has the Lord Mayor circulate on all of them do and he's smiling for for the the pitcher and the but if there's any trace of him left or anyone that looks like this there's there's no one else you get up to the Lord's mayor mayor's office you hear calls from the other hooded lanterns saying looks like the buildings clear and I say did you find anything there's the archives down down below and the holding cells no one's alive in here though any bodies that resemble the previous mayor nothing all right we should head down to the archives any like chests in here any any dressers opened like there are several chests of drawers and the the Lord mayors office overlooks the square so there's a there's a shattered balcony that looks out onto the the plaza below there are bookshelves all lining it and a large mahogany desk and an upholstered leather chair there is a pile of old cigars on the table and there are several Maps documents and various forms that it looks like the Lord Mayor was originally signing everything's been kind of tossed around in disarray in this room and it looks like one of the trolls might have been using this room as a nest and the there are several locked chests of drawers in the Lord Mayor's Office Sharda hmm sleight of hand this that's okay I have the key and I whack the circlet yeah and the drawers open up there you go I'm actually more surprised than anyone I lean back and light one of the cigars and watch ya several of the drawers as you open them up largely contain records of marriages and court trials that the Lord Mayor oversaw personally remember Hughes in the picture of the oil yes he would have been grabbed them yeah wedding documents and and as well as you go through the archives and the other chambers here you find the city construction records which bear in in them several different plans for various maps of the sewer system revealing as you look through the maps you can actually see the progression of how the city of Drakon Heim expanded out and that the that the sewer system was not entirely constructed by any one dynasty but instead was built on forecastle Drakon long ago and this is not an unknown fact was once a dwarven citadel and so many of the old tunnel that are now sewers formed the basis for the sewer systems and several of them extend out past the city limits yeah maybe there's like some secret tunnel that maybe lead us right to where the Queen's been using maybe she's been using these old tunnels oh yeah we found we found tunnels in her basement that were like caved in and I mean if we can just use this to pinpoint which ones lead there yeah that's a great way to sneak in a whole bunch of rattling alternatively as well when we think about the oncoming war if these go past the city limits imagine what we can do underground daliyah have bombs Stellarium bombs underneath armies oh man we don't get to that point the one rock that you happen to find in the lord mayor's office notes that most of the sewers don't go the they go out from the river and extend out because the the system is either meant to funnel water into the Rennell sewage into the river itself or draw fresh water from further upstream but there but one of them does note that there actually is one passage it's not part of the sewer system it's just a passage that goes underneath the river itself deep underground and you look at the maps and you can see these are intact maps of the city that's show what the South Ward looked like before the meteor hit and there are sewer passages that would have passed under where the crater is now that would have passed through that area and series of tunnels that lead in the area buckle down row as well this is invaluable yes with your knowledge of the city Vail what if people are watching us right now and they see us getting this oh man they are darn thing they probably also like I was gonna think about hiding the fact that we murdered all those people but they they first sure know those people yeah I mean yeah then we need to keep this for ourselves don't tell anyone we have it yeah because then that the only way people will know that we have it is that we'll know that they were screwing yeah exactly let's keep this reassuring but we assume they know what we know it'll be good to know maybe who does know like maybe we keep these secrets and in that way we can figure it very quickly who is uh who's crying on us now works for me hmm Ragab what we came for mm-hmm do we go back to the barracks now yeah don't arrest the tower first I need to feed my pigeons is there any is there anything else that we should do here while we're here just realized the mo drones could they be trying to fix to go home cuz we now saw them coming from the other dimension potentially that's something else to work on there's a man we never stole that one like commander mojo I mean they were all going a little crazy it was it was a hectic moment do you want to go back to the tower or do you want to go straight back to the barracks wherever I can take a rest yeah I could use a short rest okay let's head back to the tower for now shortly eight hours cool and that is where we're gonna end for the night thank you all so much a big thank you as always to our
